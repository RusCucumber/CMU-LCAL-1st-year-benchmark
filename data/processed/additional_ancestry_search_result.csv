R. Dekeyser,1995,Learning Second Language Grammar Rules,"This is a report on a computerized experiment with a miniature linguistic system, consisting of five morphological rules and a lexicon of 98 words. Two hypotheses derived from the literature in cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics were tested: that explicit-deductive learning would be better than implicit-inductive learning for straightforward (“categorical”) rules, and that implicit-inductive learning would be better than explicit-deductive learning for fuzzy rules (“prototypicality patterns”). Implicit-inductive learning was implemented by pairing sentences with color pictures; explicit-deductive learning was implemented by means of traditional grammar rule presentation, followed by picture-sentence pairing. The findings were in the expected direction for both hypotheses, but only the first one could be confirmed through statistically significant results.",145480076,10.1017/S027226310001425X,
V. Cook,1992,Evidence for Multicompetence,"The term multicompetence describes “the compound state of a mind with two grammars” (Cook, 1991a, p. 112). This paper reviews evidence addressing two questions: 1. Do people who know two languages differ from people who know only one in other respects than simply knowledge of an L2? L2 users differ from monolinguals in L1 knowledge; advanced L2 users differ from monolinguals in L2 knowledge; L2 usershave a different metalinguistic awareness from monolinguals; L2 users have different cognitive processes. These subtle differences consistently suggest that people with multicompetence are not simply equivalent to two monolinguals but are a unique combination. 2. Do people who know two languages have a merged language system rather than two separate systems? The L1 and L2 share the same mentallexicon; L2 users codeswitch readily; L2 processing cannot be cut off from LI; both languages are stored in the same areas of the brain; L2 proficiency relates to L1 proficiency. This evidence suggests merged systems at some level in some areas, even if some of it is open to other interpretations. 
A final section discusses more general issues. Much SLA research is biased by adopting the monolingual as a norm rather than the multicompetent speaker. Multicompetence distinguishes diachronic transfer during the learner's acquisition from synchronic transfer between the two languages at a single moment of time. Multicompetence starts when there is systematic knowledge of an L2 that is not assimilated to the L1. Holistic multicompetence is seen as an offshoot of polylectal grammar theory applied to monolinguals. Language teaching should try to produce multicompetent individuals not ersatz native speakers.",144463485,10.1111/J.1467-1770.1992.TB01044.X,

J. House,1996,Developing Pragmatic Fluency in English as a Foreign Language: Routines and Metapragmatic Awareness,"This study explores whether pragmatic fluency can best be acquired in the classroom by provision of input and opportunity for communicative practice alone, or whether learners profit more when additional explicit instruction in the use of conversational routines is provided. It is hypothesized that such instruction raises learners' awareness of the functions and contextual distributions of routines, enabling them to become more pragmatically fluent. Two versions of a communication course taught to advanced German learners of English for 14 weeks are examined, one version providing explicit metapragmatic information, the other withholding it. Samples of tape-recorded conversations at various stages of the courses are used to assess how students' pragmatic fluency developed and whether and how the development of fluency benefits from metapragmatic awareness.",141662199,10.1017/S0272263100014893,

M. Salaberry,2000,Pedagogical Design of Computer Mediated Communication Tasks: Learning Objectives and Technological Capabilities,"It has been claimed that the recent emergence of internet-based communication constitutes a technological innovation with the potential to create a paradigmatic shift in teaching and learning second languages (e.g., Berge & Collins, 1995; Dede, 1993; Harasim, 1990). However, for this shift to happen, materials designers need to assess critically the effects of the techno-logical capabilities of Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) as well as the features that characterize a potentially new type of literacy. Such a critical assessment will have to be based on the analysis of how specific pedagogical objectives are achieved through the design and implementation of instructional activities in CMC environments. In this respect, the analysis of such theoretical constructs as the grounding criterion and the principle of least collaborative effort (Clark & Brennan, 1991) provides a useful framework for the examination of factors that affect the choice of communication medium. In particular, different learning objectives may be achieved with a variety of technological tools (e.g., from word processors to collaborative writing software) that exhibit a range of levels of technical sophistication.",46106146,10.1111/0026-7902.00050,

N. Ishihara,2007,Web-based Curriculum for Pragmatics Instruction in Japanese as a Foreign Language: An Explicit Awareness-raising Approach,"Pragmatic ability has been recognised as an essential component of communicative competence (Canale & Swain, 1980; Hymes, 1972). However, it has been largely neglected in today's second/foreign language (L2) instruction and teacher education; few curricular attempts for teaching pragmatics have been made. This paper describes a web-based pragmatics curriculum for learners of Japanese as a foreign language, and presents the key components and principles of the curriculum. The curriculum takes an explicit pragmatic-focused awareness-raising approach (learners-as-researchers/ethnographers, Bardovi-Harlig, 1996; Tanaka, 1997) with the intention to instil in learners a sense of appropriate language use. A series of awareness-raising tasks are provided throughout the curriculum that features naturalistic audio samples and empirically established pragmatic information. Learners study L2 pragmatics through various exercises while self-checking or self-evaluating the answers and electronically sending exercise responses to the teachers and curriculum writer through the web system. During 2003–2004, this curriculum was adopted in a third year university course where learners independently completed an assigned portion of the curriculum for an introductory unit and two speech act units. The paper also explores the instructional impact on 18 learners' pragmatic awareness as found in their reflective journaling.",145528326,10.2167/la398.0,

"J. Hall, A. Cheng, Matthew T. Carlson",2006,Reconceptualizing Multicompetence as a Theory of Language Knowledge,"Over the last decade or so, the concept of multicompetence has attracted significant research attention in the field of applied linguistics and in particular in the study of multiple language use and learning. We argue that while research efforts concerned with multicompetence have been useful in advancing a more positive view of second language learners, they have been less successful in transforming understandings of language knowledge. One reason for their lack of success is the fact that these efforts have been mired in a state of theoretical confusion arising from a continued reliance on three assumptions. These assumptions include (1) a view of L1 and L2 language knowledge as distinct systems; (2) the presumption of a qualitative distinction between multicompetence and monocompetence; and (3) the assumption of homogeneity of language knowledge across speakers and contexts. Our intent here is to redress these theoretical inadequacies by making a case for a usage-based view of multicompetence. We do so by drawing on empirical evidence and theoretical insights from other areas concerned with language and language development that expose the theoretical flaws in current research efforts on multicompetence. We then use these new understandings of language to reconsider findings on the language knowledge of multiple language users and to offer new directions for research on multicompetence.",146185888,10.1093/APPLIN/AML013,
Andrea Golato,2003,Studying Compliment Responses: A Comparison of DCTs and Recordings of Naturally Occurring Talk,"This article provides a detailed study of the differences between compliment responses collected with two different data collection procedures: naturally occurring data analysed through conversation analytic (CA) methodology, and elicited data collected via a discourse completion task (DCT). The DCT was designed to evoke the same discourse context and preceding cotext observed in the naturally occurring data. The article demonstrates that these data collection procedures do not always yield data that speak equally well to given research questions. It is argued that recording naturally occurring talk-in-interaction enables the researcher to study how language is organized and realized in natural settings, whereas responses from data elicitation procedures such as DCTs indirectly reflect the sum of prior experience with language. Additionally, the article discusses advantages and disadvantages of data collection procedures including questionnaires, recall protocols, role play, field observation, and recordings of naturally occurring talk-in-interaction. The article concludes by discussing the feasibility of generalizing findings generated from the aforementioned data-collection instruments.",143742875,10.1093/APPLIN/24.1.90,

"C. Roberts, M. Byram, A. Barro, S. Jordan, B. Street",2000,Language Learners as Ethnographers,"This book describes a new approach to teaching and learning cultural studies. Borrowing the idea of ethnography from anthropologists, it argues that language students can be taught methods for investigating the cultural and social patterns of interaction and the values and beliefs that account for them. Doing an ethnographic study while living abroad immerses students in the life of particular groups, proving an intellectual challenge and the opportunity for intense intercultural encounters. The first half of the book discusses some of the current concepts in cultural and intercultural learning. The second half is a description of how the ethnography program can be run in higher education institutions, using extensive examples from ethnography courses and student projects. Overall, this book argues that the idea of language learners as ethnographers can be transferred to many contexts and that language learning should be interdisciplinary. This book is relevant to teachers of modern and foreign languages, European Studies, Latin American Studies and to teachers of upper secondary school students and trainers in intercultural communication.",142146329,10.21832/9781853596810,

Jenny A. Thomas,1983,Cross-Cultural Pragmatic Failure,"/ have given the term pragmatic failure' to the inability to understand 'what is meant by what is said'. In this paper I argue that pragmatic failure is an area of cross-cultural communication breakdown which has received very little attention from language teachers. I suggest that there is one area of pragmatic failure ('pragmalinguistic failure') which is fairly easy to overcome. It is simply a question of highly conventionalized usage which can be taught quite straightforwardly as 'part of the grammar'. The second area ('sociopragmatic failure') is much more difficult to deal with, since it involves the student's system of beliefs as much as his/her knowledge of the language. I argue that it is essential to avoid prescriptivism in this very sensitive area of language in use. To do so we must draw on insights from theoretical pragmatics and develop ways of heightening and refining students' metapragmatic awareness, so that they are able to express themselves as they choose.",35667508,10.1093/APPLIN/4.2.91,

J. Cenoz,2005,BILINGUALISM: BEYOND BASIC PRINCIPLES,"BILINGUALISM: BEYOND BASIC PRINCIPLES. Jean-Marc Dewaele, Alex Housen, and Li Wei (Eds.). Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters, 2003. Pp. ix +233. £49.90 cloth, £22.95 paper. This volume is a festschrift in honor of Hugo Baetens Beardsmore on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday and the twentieth anniversary of the publication of his book Bilingualism: Basic principles (1982). The volume includes 12 articles in addition to an introduction and a laudatio. The volume reflects the important developments of studies in bilingualism in the last 20 years and covers a great variety of areas related to the sociolinguistic, educational, and psycholinguistic dimensions of bilingualism. The first chapter is a reprint of one of Baetens Beardsmore's lesser known publications (1988) and discusses the fears of bilingualism at different levels. Fifteen years later, this chapter still addresses the most important issues related to bilingualism often discussed by teachers, parents, and policy makers. The next three chapters focus on the social aspects of bilingualism: Edwards discusses bilingualism and identity in chapter 2, Clyne addresses the role of intrinsic motivation and metalinguistic awareness in bilingualism in chapter 3, and Cummins examines the differences between the criticism against bilingual education in the American press and the positive results of research on the outcomes of bilingualism in chapter 4. These three chapters each have a different focus but taken together provide an interesting perspective of the social factors affecting bilingualism. Chapter 5 by Martin and chapter 7 by Jones discuss multilingual education in Brunei. These two chapters describe the languages used in schools, the educational context, and the most recent changes in education in Brunei and could be of interest for educators in other bilingual contexts. Chapter 6 by Baker and chapter 8 by Wei and Milroy both discuss language and society but focus on minority languages in two completely different settings—Wales and Singapore. Both chapters discuss interesting theoretical aspects that are then applied to specific settings. Chapter 9 (Fraser Gupta) has a very weak link to the rest of the chapters in the book and analyzes seven self-study books of Malay from different periods. Chapter 10 (Lüdi) and chapter 11 (Myers-Scotton) discuss interesting theoretical aspects of codeswitching, and the last chapter (Genesee) focuses on the similarities and differences between early monolingual and bilingual acquisition. These three chapters are more research oriented than the rest of the chapters in the book, both because of their theoretical basis and the empirical data they discuss. They may also be the most interesting for researchers in SLA.",142634697,10.1017/S0272263105280051,
Satomi Takahashi,2001,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: The role of input enhancement in developing pragmatic competence,"Introduction Input enhancement in second language acquisition (SLA) has been addressed in studies of form-focused instruction at morphosyntactic levels, known as Focus on Form (FonF) research (e.g., White, Spada, Lightbown & Ranta, 1991; Carroll, Swain & Roberge, 1992; Fotos, 1993; Spada & Lightbown, 1993; Trahey & White, 1993; see Doughty & Williams, 1998; Long & Robinson, 1998, for an overview). Following Sharwood Smith's (1991, 1993) definition of input enhancement, researchers experimentally manipulated instructional input on L2 structures in various ways: some form of corrective feedback with or without metalinguistic information (e.g., Doughty & Varela, 1998), visual enhancement (textual modification) with the use of bold or italic face (e.g., Alanen, 1995; Jourdenais, Ota, Stauffer, Boyson, & Doughty, 1995; J. White, 1998), and task manipulation directing learners to notice and attend to target structures (e.g., Hulstijn, 1989; Robinson, 1996; Williams & Evans, 1998). All of these studies provided evidence that high levels of attention-drawing activities, as represented by presenting metalinguistic information and corrective feedback, are more helpful for learners in gaining the mastery of target-language structures than simple exposure to positive evidence. These findings thus provide the basis for theoretical verification of Schmidt's (1993a, 1995, 1998) Noticing Hypothesis, which states that conscious noticing is the necessary and sufficient condition for converting input to intake. In contrast to the rich array of input enhancement research into morphosyntactic features, there have been considerably fewer studies specifically focusing on the role of input enhancement in developing L2 pragmatic competence.",142737322,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.014,
Michael H. Long,1983,Does Second Language Instruction Make a Difference? A Review of Research,"Does second language instruction promote second language acquisition? Some studies conclude that instruction does not help (or even that it is counter-productive); others find it beneficial. The picture becomes clearer if two distinctions are made. First, researchers may address one or both of two issues: the absolute effect of instruction, on the one hand, and its relative utility, on the other. Second, studies need to be subclassified according to whether or not the comparisons they make involve controlling for the total amount of instruction, exposure, or instruction plus exposure-that is, for the total opportunity to acquire the second language. Observing these distinctions, a review of research findings concludes that there is considerable (although not overwhelming) evidence that instruction is beneficial 1) for children as well as adults, 2) for beginning, intermediate, and advanced students, 3) on integrative as well as discrete-point tests, and 4) in acquisition-rich as well as acquisition-poor environments. These findings have implications for theories of second language acquisition, such as Krashen's Monitor Theory, which make predictions about second language acquisition with and without instruction, and also for those involved in educational administration, program design, and classroom teaching.",146587499,10.2307/3586253,

"Kenneth R. Rose, Connie Ng Kwai-fun",2001,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: Inductive and deductive teaching of compliments and compliment responses,"Introduction This chapter reports the results of a study on the effects of inductive and deductive approaches to instruction in pragmatics, with the target features being compliments and compliment responses. The literature on these speech acts – along with that on requests and apologies – is among the richest in crosscultural and interlanguage pragmatics, offering coverage of both pragmalinguistics and sociopragmatics. Compliments and compliment responses were also among the first speech acts to be targeted for empirically informed teaching of pragmatics (Holmes & Brown, 1987), as well as for the study of the effects of instruction in interlanguage pragmatics (Billmyer, 1990a, 1990b). The current study incorporates aspects of each of these lines of inquiry, but adds several elements, namely, the two instructional approaches and the foreign language context. Background We will not provide a detailed survey of the literature on the effects of instruction in pragmatics, or on issues such as explicit and implicit learning, both of which receive comprehensive coverage in Bardovi- Harlig (this volume) and Kasper (this volume). We will, however, discuss in brief some of the relevant literature on compliments and compliment responses, the effects of instruction in compliments and compliment responses, and inductive and deductive approaches to teaching. Research on compliments is largely traced back to the work of Nessa Wolfson and Joan Manes (Wolfson & Manes, 1980; Manes & Wolfson, 1981; Wolfson, 1981a, 1981b, 1983, 1984, 1988, 1989a; Manes, 1983), which provided the first comprehensive description of the formulaicity of compliments in American English.",142541504,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.013,

D. Yoshimi,2001,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: Explicit instruction and JFL learner's use of interactional discourse markers,"Introduction The development of L2 pragmatic competence entails the ability to use a wide range of conversational routines and discourse strategies to manage one's communicative interactions with others. Since the early 1980s, researchers have established that a foreign language learner's development of various aspects of pragmatic competence may be facilitated by the instruction of pragmatic routines and strategies in the foreign language classroom (Kasper, this volume). House (1996, p. 247) points out that when such instruction is explicit, it appears to be particularly beneficial since it enables learners to develop an awareness and understanding of the differences between L1 and L2 pragmatic preferences, and thereby “counteract negative L1 transfer through ‘noticing’ (Schmidt, 1993b) and through making attempts to use alternative, more L2 norm-oriented expressions.” In a comparison of the relative benefits of implicit and explicit instruction, House (1996) reports on two sections (i.e., implicit and explicit) of a 14-week communication course instructed in the use of everyday, conversational routines. Through lectures, handouts, and explanatory feedback that provided metapragmatic information on the use and function of these routines, the members of the explicit group had additional opportunities to raise their awareness of preferred L2 pragmatic practices and to “notice” differences between L1 and L2 practices. House argues that the greater improvement shown by the explicit group, particularly in areas where the pragmatic preferences of the learners' L1 differed from those of the target L2, is a result of the learners' heightened awareness of L1-L2 pragmatic differences.",143028035,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.016,
"J. Norris, L. Ortega",2000,Effectiveness of L2 Instruction: A Research Synthesis and Quantitative Meta‐analysis,"This study employed (and reports in detail) systematic procedures for research synthesis and meta-analysis to summarize findings from experimental and quasi-experimental investigations into the effectiveness of L2 instruction published between 1980 and 1998. Comparisons of average effect sizes from 49 unique sample studies reporting sufficient data indicated that focused L2 instruction results in large target-oriented gains, that explicit types of instruction are more effective than implicit types, and that Focus on Form and Focus on Forms interventions result in equivalent and large effects. Further findings suggest that the effectiveness of L2 instruction is durable and that the type of outcome measures used in individual studies likely affects the magnitude of observed instructional effectiveness. Generalizability of findings is limited because the L2 type-of-instruction domain has yet to engage in rigorous empirical operationalization and replication of its central research constructs. Changes in research practices are recommended to enhance the future accumulation of knowledge about the effectiveness of L2 instruction.",144168329,10.1111/0023-8333.00136,
K. Bardovi-Harlig,2001,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: Evaluating the empirical evidence: Grounds for instruction in pragmatics?,"Introduction Everyone who works with a second or foreign language, whether learners, teachers, or researchers, knows a funny story about crosscultural pragmatics – or maybe the stories are really not that funny. From the perspective of the speaker, they may be about feeling silly, helpless, or rude; from the perspective of the listener, they may be about feeling confused, insulted, or angry. Anecdotal evidence inspires us to say that we ought to teach, as one of our ESL students said, the “secret rules” of language. Much research has gone into identifying how speakers of various languages realize speech acts, take turns, and use silence, for example, so that what our student called the secret rules are not unknown; and even if our knowledge is incomplete at this stage, could it form the basis of an informed pedagogy? In other words, is there empirical evidence that warrants the development and implementation of a pedagogy of pragmatics in second and foreign language instruction? In this chapter, I will review the empirical evidence that shows that native speakers (NSs) and nonnative speakers (NNSs) of a given target language appear to have different systems of pragmatics, discuss the factors that influence the development of L2 pragmatics systems, and then address the question of whether differences in pragmatics systems warrant instructional treatment. The evidence This review adopts a speech act perspective. Although it is not the only way of viewing pragmatics, speech act research has been well represented in crosscultural and interlanguage pragmatics research, and provides a common analytic framework which facilitates comparison across studies.",142558425,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.005,

Relevant language learner strategy literature and speech act literature are reviewed. After defining language learning and use strategies, the article makes the case for enhancing learner strategies in developing speech act ability. Next, as a lead up to the presentation of the taxonomy of strategies, the issue of where learners are to find empirical sources for speech act material is addressed, with attention given to the current concerns for naturally-occurring data. This is followed by a review of literature on efforts to teach pragmatics. The article concludes with a discussion of suggested avenues for validating the strategy taxonomy.",144362215,10.1515/iprg.2005.2.3.275,

"A. Liddicoat, C. Crozet",2001,Acquiring French interactional norms through instruction,"Introduction The emergence of intercultural competence in language teaching (Kramsch, 1993, 1995; Lustig & Koester, 1993; Byram & Zarate, 1994; Crozet, Liddicoat, & Lo Bianco, 1999) has led to a need to focus on a second language as a vehicle for communication in cultural contexts, and this in turn implies that an important goal for language learning is developing an understanding of appropriate communication in the target language (Zarate, 1986; Buttjes & Byram, 1990; Kramsch, 1995; Tickoo, 1995; Fantini, 1997; Liddicoat, 1997b). Consequently, language teaching now needs to be seen more in the context of intercultural communication, with the aim of preparing learners to communicate outside their own cultural boundaries (Bolten, 1993; Crozet, 1996; Liddicoat, 1997b; Liddicoat & Crozet, 1997; Liddicoat, Crozet, Jansen, & Schmidt, 1997; Crozet & Liddicoat, 1999; Crozet et al., 1999). In such a perspective, pragmatic and discoursal practices become an integral part of language learning from early on because they play a central role in intercultural communication, and mismatches between them have been identified as a key factor in communication breakdowns. Many studies have shown that culturally based differences about what is expected during communication can be a significant cause of crosscultural communication difficulties (Gumperz, Judd, & Roberts, 1979; Wierzbicka, 1985, 1991; Kotthoff & Auer, 1987; Gudykunst & Kim, 1992). These expectations may be linked to differences in the realization of particular speech acts, or they may be linked to broader, and often more diffuse, issues of discourse organization and conversational style.",141887945,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.012,

"Elite Olshtain, A. Cohen",1990,The Learning of Complex Speech Act Behaviour,"The study reported in this article concerns itself with the learning and teaching of the more subtle and complex features of the speech act of apology in English. Based on the knowledge that we have to date on apology speech act behaviour, we addressed ourselves to questions relating to the efficacy of teaching such elements as: choice of semantic formula; appropriate length of realization patterns; use of intensifiers; judgment of appropriacy and students' preferences for certain teaching techniques. In order to attempt and answer these questions we carried out a training study with I8 adult learners of English, speakers of Hebrew. The study consisted of : a) a pre-teaching questionnaire aimed at assessing the subjects' use of apologies; b) a teaching materials packet covering three classroom sessions and c) a postteaching questionnaire. The findings suggest that although we cannot present clear cut quantitative improvement of the learners' speech act behaviour after the given training programme, we find that there is an obvious qualitative approximation of native like speech act behaviour with respect to types of intensification and downgrading, choice of strategy and awareness of situational factors. We feel, therefore, that the teaching of speech act behaviour is a worthwhile project even if the aim is only to raise the learners' awareness of appropriate speech act behaviour.",143192392,10.18806/TESL.V7I2.568,

"A.

This study focuses on one important aspect of such competence: the ability to use the appropriate sociocultural rules of speaking, by reacting in a culturally acceptable way in context and by choosing stylistically appropriate forms for that context. We chose to look at productive performance in sociocultural aspects of speaking, focusing on the speech act of “apology.” The research question that prompted this study was, “Can a rating scale be developed for assessing sociocultural competence?” The subjects were 32 native Hebrew speakers, 20 of whom served as informants for apologies in English LZ and 12 as informants in Hebrew LI, and 12 Americans who served as informants in English LI. These subjects were asked to role-play their responses in eight situations in which an apology was expected. The findings show that it is possible to identify culturally and stylistically inappropriate L2 utterances in apology situations. The authors feel, however, that the results so far provide at best a crude measure of sociocultural competence and that further work with this speech act and with others is called for.",144249347,10.1111/J.1467-1770.1981.TB01375.X,
"Elsa Roberts, Burgess, Denise",1995,Teaching particular languages,"outlines the design and development of a course the aimed to meet the needs of ESL students studying in the Faculty of Arts. The development of Critical Language Awareness in relation to general and subject specific study skills is discussed. The term 'Critical Communication Skills' (CCS) is intro-duced and defined. An outline is given of a two-part course. In Part One students work through materials which address CCS in relation to subject of common interest — the media in South Africa. In Part Two the demands of studying specific subjects are presented (e.g. Philosophy). The course is discussed in relation to ESP and critical skills development for use beyond university study. each associated with different types of innovations, highlight a new set of perspectives on the role of perceived attributes of ELT innovations. This paper reports the findings of a study on the intonation of second-language speakers of English from three language groups: Spanish, Japanese and Thai. The investigation focused on how non-native speakers use intonation to signal meaning in the structure of their discourse. Thirty adult speakers of English as a second language at the intermediate level and ten native speaker controls were tape recorded in both oral reading and free speech tasks. The speech data were analysed on a Visipitch machine to measure how pitch and intensity were used contrastively to show relationships in discourse. Following a model of intonational meaning dev-eloped by Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, pitch accents, phrase accents, boundary tones, and para-tones were measured. The study revealed that while the native speakers made significant use of pitch contrasts to signal meaning on the items measured, the non-native speakers did not consistently use pitch to signal meaningful contrasts in many of the same environments. This study investigated the effect of functional-analytic teaching on aspects of French immersion (FI) students sociolinguistic competence at the Grade 8 level. A set of functional-analytic materials, entailing the study and practice of sociostylistic variation, was implemented in three FI classrooms by their respective teachers during French language arts classes over an average period of five weeks. A pre-test, an immediate post-test, and a delayed post-test were administered to the experimental group as well as to a comparison group in order to compare classes on three measures of sociolinguistic competence (defined as the ability to recognise and produce socially appropriate language in context). The study demonstrated that functional-analytic teaching substantially improved aspects of FI students' sociolinguistic competence in at least three ways: (1) by significantly increasing their ability in oral production to appropriately and accurately use vous in formal situations; (2) by significantly increasing their ability in written production to appropriately use vous in formal letters, and, in the short run, to use polite closings in formal letters; and (3) by significantly increasing their ability to recognise contextually appropriate French. speakers showed that: (1) the present perfect serves as the dominant past tense form for main verbs in the German colloquial standard; (2) modal verbs, the copula sein 'be,' haben 'have,' and certain formulaic expression occur in the preterite; and (3) the use of the past tense forms is linked to contextual and social factors. A German syllabus, then, must include a discussion of verb type when presenting the everyday use of the German preterite and present perfect. The study points to the situational and social contexts influencing the use of grammatical structures rather than merely presenting contextless rules governing their use. This study examines the role of illustrations in language learning and presents an analysis of the illustration content of 18 texts for teaching introductory Spanish published between 1960 and 1989. It also discusses the appropriate use of illustrations in teaching and considers future prospects.",143606191,10.1017/S0261444800007953,
