"Dehghan, Farzaneh;Rezvani, Reza",2016,Transfer at the level of argument structure or morphology: a comparative study of English and Persian unaccusative and unergative verbs,"Transitivity alternation refers to the causative/inchoative alternation of some unaccusative verbs. Different languages use different patterns to show transitivity alternation morphologically. While some languages like English use zero or no overt lexical marking, other languages (e.g. Spanish, Turkish, and Japanese) use overt morphological markers to show transitivity. This study aims to investigate the degree to which similarities and/or mismatches between English and Persian influence the use of unaccusative and unergative verbs by Persianspeaking learners of English. Based on different verb types in English and Persian, seven verb categories were identified as the basis for comparison. A forced-choice elicitation test including 48 items was developed based on these seven verb categories. A proficiency test was also used to divide participants (116 undergraduate students of English) into high and low proficiency groups. The results revealed findings more in line with transfer at the morphological rather than the argument structure level (Montrul, 2000). Alternating unaccusatives with similar equivalent structures for transitive/intransitive pairs in Persian and non-alternating unaccusatives with different structures for transitive/intransitive pairs in Persian seem to be the most difficult verb categories for learners. The effect of proficiency level was also significant on the recognition of correct structures.", Journal Article,10.1515/topling-2016-0008,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/transfer-at-level-argument-structure-morphology/docview/3158214905/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

According to this theory, interlocutors of a conversation follow the four maxims of Quality, Quantity, Relevance and Manner or deliberately violate them in order to convey a message which is beyond what is directly said.

"Gashan, Amani K;Almohaisen, Fahad M",2014,The Effect of Task Repetition on Fluency And Accuracy of EFL Saudi Female Learners’ Oral Performance,"This study aimed to examine the effect of task repetition on foreign language output. Twenty eight Saudi female students in the Preparatory Year (PY) at King Saud university, were randomly selected to conduct an oral information-gap task. The participants were asked to perform the task two times with two-week interval between the two performances. The oral performances were transcribed and analyzed to measure fluency and accuracy of language output. The collected data were coded for the two dimensions of oral production (fluency and accuracy), based on the established criteria. A within group dependent t-test for paired samples was computed to find out whether there were significant differences between the mean scores of the first and the second performances. The findings revealed that task repetition resulted in significant differences in the subjects’ oral discourse in terms of fluency and accuracy. The findings of the current study recommend that researchers and teachers might find it very beneficial to devote some of their time to design effective task repetition to help language learners improve their oral production.", Journal Article,,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effect-task-repetition-on-fluency-accuracy-efl/docview/2188090890/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Tominaga, Waka",2014,"Validating the scoring inference of the Japanese OPI ratings: The use of extended turns, connective expressions, and discourse organization","Adopting Kane’s (2006) argument-based approach to validity as a guiding framework, this study examined the scoring inference of the OPI ratings based on the level descriptions in the ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines, with a focus on the “text type” criterion. The Guidelines state that Intermediate speakers typically produce “sentences” while Advanced speakers are capable of using “connected discourse of paragraph length” (ACTFL, 2012c, pp. 5–8). However, there is little empirical evidence to support such characterizations. In an attempt to fill this gap, this conversation analytic study investigated the appropriateness of the text type criterion by examining how Intermediate and Advanced candidates participated in turn-taking in the OPI and responded to the OPI’s narration and description tasks, which were designed to elicit a “connected discourse of paragraph length.” The focal data consisted of audio/video recordings of 15 face-to-face Japanese OPIs. From a larger pool of OPI data collected for program assessment research by the College of Languages, Linguistics, and Literature at the University of Hawai‘i at Manoa, three OPIs for each of the five (sub)levels ranging from Intermediate-Low to Advanced-Mid were randomly selected and transcribed. The study found that while the candidates at higher proficiency levels tended to demonstrate superior ability to use connective expressions in their discourse, the level descriptions concerning the text type criterion did not necessarily match actual candidate performance, especially for the lower proficiency levels (Intermediate-Low/Mid). The problems seemed to reside in the Guidelines’ failure to recognize the candidates’ interactional competence to produce sequentially appropriate actions in an orderly manner, as well as the use of units of analysis for writing (e.g., sentences, paragraphs) to describe oral proficiency. Further research is called for in order to collect more empirical evidence to inform future revisions of the Guidelines.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/validating-scoring-inference-japanese-opi-ratings/docview/1652520382/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Furukawa, Gavin Ken",2014,The use of English as a local language resource for identity construction in Japanese television variety shows,"This dissertation examines the context of Japanese variety shows to analyze the ways that English is used for identity construction and how this relates to the idea of English as a local resource but still connected to the wider world. It also analyzes the ways that English is used as an entertainment resource for both variety programs and for the people who appear on these shows. Japanese variety shows are a site where tarento , entertainers that are marketed through their personality without belonging to single categories such as singer, actor, or dancer, are often ridiculed and humiliated for the purposes of entertainment. During this process, the tarento will often construct themselves and others through tactics of intersubjectivity that isolate individuals from the larger group using different dimensions of relation. This dissertation takes a Sociocultural Linguistics approach to the data allowing for the combination of multiple methods and traditions to gain a more holistic understanding of the connections between the English Language, Japanese media culture, and society. Drawing upon Bakhtin’s (1981) chronotopes, and Bateson’s (1972) notion of interpretive frames, I analyze the discourse of Japanese variety shows as a series of embedded frames of different places in space and time that are constructed through indirect indexical reference working together to create a single text. Utilizing data from focus groups and interviews as well as broadcast data this dissertation investigates the content of the text, audience reception and production aspects of Japanese television. I analyze the uses of English to construct images of intelligence and social cool as well as stupidity and unstylishness through indexical fields. The analysis reveals how socially positive and negative images are used as marketable resources and how intermediary level discourse in the form of screen text or telop can present itself as having institutional authority through use of typography. My findings reveal that English is used in a continuing cycle connecting the indexical fields of English to the program and the viewership. The findings also show that the educational context of learning English is never totally separated from its use in this medium.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/use-english-as-local-language-resource-identity/docview/1651539026/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Chu, Wei",2014,<i>Wh</i>-existential words: A comparative study of English-Chinese and Korean-Chinese interlanguages,"This dissertation looks at native language (L1) influence on adult nonnative language (L2) lexical development, investigating, in particular, whether the syntactic and semantic properties underlying L1 words have effects on the acquisition of lexical equivalents in the L2. The investigation is motivated by the following crosslinguistic differences as instantiated in wh -words in Chinese, Korean and English with respect to the existential sense: In Chinese, wh -words (e.g., shenme ) can be used as existentials (i.e., ‘something/anything’) as well as interrogatives (i.e., ‘what’) (Cheng, 1991; Huang, 1982). Chinese wh -existentials are confined to syntactico-semantic environments denoting nonveridicality (e.g., negatives, yes/no questions, conditionals) (Giannakidou, 2011); in Korean, wh -existentials are free of these restrictions (Gil &amp; Marsden, 2013); and in English, wh -words can never function as existentials. A comparative Interlanguage study is conducted to examine wh -existentials in the L2 Chinese of adult L1-Korean and L1-English speakers. The exploration centers on two main predictions based on Sprouse’s (2006) Lexical Transfer Hypothesis: (i) In nonveridical constructions, lower proficiency L1-Korean L2 learners of Chinese will pattern like Chinese native speakers in allowing wh -existentials, whereas lower proficiency L1-English L2 learners will show inhibitions against them; (ii) in veridical constructions, lower proficiency L1-English L2 learners will perform like Chinese speakers in prohibiting nontarget wh -existentials, whereas lower proficiency L1-Korean L2 learners will be inclined to allow them. Intermediate and advanced L1-English and L1-Korean L2 learners of Chinese (English intermediate, n = 20; English advanced, n = 22; Korean intermediate, n = 21; Korean advanced, n = 20) and native speakers of Chinese ( n = 30) completed three experiments targeting the interpretations of shenme ‘THING’ in nonveridical negative sentences and veridical present progressive sentences (contextualized multiple-choice interpretation task), the existential use of shenme ‘THING’ and shui ‘PERSON’ in nonveridical negative sentences and veridical present progressive sentences (elicited production task), and the acceptability judgments of existential shui ‘PERSON’ in yes/no questions and conditionals (acceptability judgment task). The results of the three experiments generally support the Lexical Transfer Hypothesis, which suggests that a deep level of lexical transfer – transfer of the syntactic and semantic properties underlying L1 lexical items – indeed influences L2 lexical development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/i-wh-existential-words-comparative-study-english/docview/1651531357/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Yang, Jia",2014,Toward a Pedagogy of Conventional Expressions in Chinese Culture,"Conventional expressions refer to any expression with a stable form that is commonly repeated in the routinized social interactions of a given culture. Expressions, such as “how are you?” “Nice to meet you,” are examples of such repetitions in the context of “greetings” in American culture. Conventional expressions are easily recognizable to members of a given culture so that no special efforts are needed to interpret desired meanings. They are culture specific and are often utilized to help newcomers (or novices) and language learners to be socialized in the interactions of a particular culture. Considering the importance of conventional expressions in language learning, this dissertation reports on a written-discourse-completion production test and a multiple-choice recognition test that were conducted to investigate the development of American learners' recognition and production of conventional expressions in typical social routines in Chinese culture, such as greetings, refusals, apologies and displays of gratitude. Results show that the length of exposure to the target language environment enables students to recognize more conventional expressions, but it does not ensure the students' abilities to produce these expressions. Students' successful production of the target forms are more likely to be related to their uses of different study strategies. In the data, high-performing students use the strategy of “making a mental picture of a situation in which the expression is used” and the strategy of “connecting a new expression to an image or picture associated with the expression” more frequently than low performing students do. The adoption of these deep mental processing strategies enable high performing students to store and retrieve useful expressions better, and hence they are more likely to successfully produce and recognize conventional expressions. The obtained results suggest three developmental stages for students' ability to produce conventional expressions: recognizing the expression in context, distinguishing the communicative intention conveyed by a set of related expressions, and producing the expression automatically in typical contexts that evoke the target expression. This dissertation brings the CFL field's attention to the fact that even in ordinary talk, contemporary Chinese will often display their personal versatility and ingenuity by using a number of expressions drawn from the cultural tradition. Consequently, a foreigner's ability to understand and use conventional expressions is often considered by Chinese speakers to be an important indicator of acculturation and high-language proficiency. Training of students to recognize, to understand, and then to automatically use these expressions in typical social situations in Chinese culture can enable students to be effective communicators in Chinese, and thus shorten their time to achieving higher level of proficiency. Empirical studies from this dissertation also show that the training should not only provide ample opportunities of practice for students to perform the target expressions in context, but also provide the coaching of effective strategies for students to notice, to interpret and then to remember these expressions.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/toward-pedagogy-conventional-expressions-chinese/docview/1647128916/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Morales, Alexandra",2014,Production and comprehension of verb agreement morphology in Spanish and English child L2 learners: Evidence for the effects of morphological structure,"Verbal inflections are problematic for both first language (L1) and second language (L2) learners in both comprehension and production and take a while to develop. Most research has mainly looked at this phenomenon from the perspective of functional features and has tried to ascertain whether or not learners have the grammatical knowledge or representation of the L2. However, although insightful, research has failed to look in greater detail at how the structure of the target-language may affect learners’ production and comprehension of verbal morphemes. In L1 acquisition, it has been found that the structure of the language may have an effect on children’s verbal morphology acquisition. However, it is basically unknown whether this is also true for L2 acquisition or, if in contrast, all child L2 learners show similar patterns of verbal morphology acquisition regardless of the L2. The present study addresses this issue and investigates whether child L2 learners learning typologically distinct languages show similar acquisition of verbal morphology. In order to address the study’s objectives, the acquisition of agreement morphology in school-age children learning Spanish and learning English as L2 was evaluated. Thirty two English-speaking children with ages ranging from 7;5 to 10;11 years (M = 8;9), were tested in the United States. All of these children were enrolled in an immersion program and had started learning Spanish when they were between 4 and 7 years old (M= 4.9). Additionally, 32 Spanish-speaking children, with ages ranging from 7;7 to 9;9 years (M= 9;0), were tested in Puerto Rico. All of these children were enrolled in an immersion program and had started learning English when they were between 4 and 5 years old (M=4.3). The results revealed that the children learning Spanish showed high accuracy in producing Spanish 3rd person plurals and performed native-like in comprehending verbal agreement. In contrast, the children learning English exhibited low accuracy in both the production and comprehension of verbal agreement (3rd person singular -s), and did not reach native-like performance in any of the tasks. These results suggest that there may be some parallelism between verbal morphology acquisition in L1 children and verbal morphology acquisition in child L2 learners. In both, the morphological structure of the language seems to play a role in the process of acquisition. The findings reported here for child L2 learners suggest that highly and regular inflected systems (e.g. Spanish) will be acquired at a faster rate than poorly and inconsistent inflected languages (e.g. English).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/production-comprehension-verb-agreement/docview/1639029567/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Adelman, Allison Silver",2014,Conversations with Native Speakers: Acquiring Japanese as a Second Language,"Children acquire their L1 entirely through interactions with other speakers; in the same way, L2 learners benefit from participating in conversations with native speakers. I take a discourse-functional view of native speaker competence, assuming that positive evidence (language in use), comprising both frequency and contexts of usage, plays an important role in native speakers' mental representations and acquisition of grammar. If we assume that any comfortably proficient L2 speaker cannot have acquired that language ability solely from textbooks or classroom instruction, then the question arises: in what ways does conversation help language learners acquire a discourse-based grammar mirroring that of native speakers? I address this question across three case studies, using data from twelve conversations, each between one native speaker and one non-native speaker of Japanese. The first case study (Chapter 3) investigates the types of explicit and implicit interactional feedback (comprising negative as well as positive evidence) that native speakers provide in conversation with non-native speakers. I conduct a qualitative analysis of points in the conversation related to the non-native speaker's language ability, including instances of explicit metalinguistic discussion and of implicit feedback, such as recasts of non-native speaker utterances, and I suggest the ways in which these function as potential L2 learning mechanisms. In the other two case studies, I examine the question: To what extent do the conversational grammars of non-native speakers exhibit the same relationships between grammatical form and discourse function as the conversational grammars of native speakers? In Chapter 4, I conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of Noun-Modifying Constructions (NMCs) and compare the usage of NMCs among native vs. non-native speakers, based on discourse factors, finding that the non-native speakers, especially those with more experience living in Japan, produced NMCs with frequencies and distributions similar to those of the native speakers. In Chapter 5, a quantitative analysis of subject argument realization, I use a mixed-effects model to show that both native and non-native speakers' patterns of subject realization are influenced by discourse-pragmatic factors such as givenness and contrast, and that the patterns observed among non-native speakers mirror those in native speakers' speech. I propose that non-native speakers can only demonstrate such similar sensitivities to discourse-pragmatic factors if exposed to native-speaker-like frequencies of use in conversation. The findings of this case study allow for a glimpse into the impact of positive evidence from natural input on L2 learners' acquisition of discourse-based grammar.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/conversations-with-native-speakers-acquiring/docview/1638273016/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Lake, Julie B.",2014,The role of individual differences in L1 and L2 processing of bridging and predictive inferences,"Second language acquisition (SLA) and psycholinguistic researchers are interested in how inferences are processed in first language (L1) and second language (L2) reading to better understand how learners negotiate for meaning within a text. Preliminary evidence from brain-based studies suggests that bridging inferences (i.e., connecting pronouns and referents) may rely more heavily on short-term memory (STM) (Burkhardt, 2006) while predictive inferences (i.e., forecasting upcoming events from textual information) may rely more heavily on cognitive control (CC) (Jin et al., 2009). However, despite these advances, it is still not clear whether or not L2 readers have access to the necessary linguistic structures (Horiba, 1996) or, instead, if proficiency level is a confounding variable (Cohen, 1998; Guerrero, 2005; Leontiev, 1981). To address these gaps, an L1 English reading study and an L2 English reading study were carried out to explore whether or not inferences are processed differently than non-inferences, whether or not bridging and predictive inferences are processed differently from one another, and which cognitive resources are recruited during the processing of bridging and predictive inferences. The L1 and L2 data were compared to see if inference processing differs based on language background. L1 English speakers ( n = 50) and L2 English-L1 Spanish speakers ( n = 23) completed a cumulative self-paced reading task in a distraction paradigm; participants read scenarios that required them to make a bridging inference, a predictive inference or no inference with interference (while completing a secondary task that taxed STM or CC) or without interference. Independent measures of STM and CC were also collected to see whether these scores were associated with reading performance. The results indicated that L1 and proficient L2 readers process inferences similarly. Participants relied on CC for bridging and predictive inferences, supporting a multi-component framework of attentional control capacity (Barnes &amp; Jones, 2000). These results are consistent with research on individual difference in SLA (e.g., Dornyei &amp; Skehan, 2003), in that they suggest that CC may influence L2 classroom learning and account for the variation in L2 reading acquisition. Additionally, the findings have implications for L2 testing, as they pose a threat to the internal validity of standardized reading tests and ultimately the grade-level placement of L2 readers.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-individual-differences-l1-l2-processing/docview/1629825583/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Alameen, Ghinwa",2014,The effectiveness of linking instruction on NNS speech perception and production,"Despite the prevalence of connected speech processes in spoken English and their importance for communication, there has been relatively little research on them in the field of second language learning. This study investigated the effectiveness of using two methods for teaching linking to NNSs of English. Audio-visual (AV) feedback, integrating both audio and electronic visual feedback, and audio-only (AO) feedback were employed in the development of online materials to help improve learners' perception and production of consonant-to-vowel linking such as 'give in' and vowel-to-vowel linking such as 'see it'. The long-term effectiveness of the instructional materials was also examined to see whether learners were able to retain improvement beyond the training period. In addition, the study explored whether improvement can transfer to novel contexts. The influence of high frequency and low frequency words on linking production was also investigated. Finally, students' perceptions of the use of AV and AO feedback were reported to guide future implementation of the materials. Forty-five learners of English participated in the study with 15 students in each of the two experimental groups and the control group. A pretest, posttest and delayed posttest design was implemented to answer the research questions of the study. Students' dictation of old and new sentences and their audio recordings of two read texts were analyzed. Qualitative data consisted of students' answers to a post-training questionnaire. Findings indicate that both types of training were effective in improving learners' perception and production of linking immediately and one month after training. Learners were also able to transfer the gained improvement to novel contexts. In addition, it was found that students' improvement of linking high frequency words was significantly greater than that of low frequency words, which were more difficult to link. The use of audio-visual training with waveforms resulted in better improvement in linking perception and production as well as more positive learner feedback than the audio-only training. The findings of the study hold a number of pedagogical implications for language teachers, material developers, and those interested in researching connected speech and the use of technology for language learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effectiveness-linking-instruction-on-nns-speech/docview/1621585779/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Jackson, Daniel O.",2014,"The relative contribution of input modification, learner awareness, and individual differences to second language construction learning","This study adopts a constructionist approach to investigating three recent proposals grounded in cognitive perspectives on second language acquisition, which broaden the research agenda in the areas of input modification, learner awareness, and individual differences. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the following would support learning of artificial morphological constructions: (a) input modification in the form of partially repeated sequences, (b) awareness of precise form-meaning mappings, and (c) cognitive-affective learner differences. During the computerized training phase of the study, 90 English-dominant undergraduate participants were placed into three conditions: two experimental conditions exhibiting partial repetition similar to that found in caregiver discourse and a control condition exhibiting no such repetition. The testing phase utilized a picture-word matching task to assess participants’ ability to judge correct versus incorrect constructions based on trained and untrained subtest items. Learner awareness was gauged through source attributions and a retrospective written questionnaire. Measures of learner differences included working memory tasks (reading span and dual 3-back) and personality scales (openness and intellect). A test-retest study with 20 of the participants showed these individual difference measures to be relatively stable. Results indicated that the study’s hypotheses were largely supported. Learner awareness levels, reading span scores, and item type significantly predicted outcomes on the trained and untrained subtests of the picture-word matching task, based on a regression model including the random effects of items and participants. Also, a better fit to the data was achieved by using a fine-grained, rather than course-grained, system of coding awareness. However, contrary to hypothesis, participants in the experimental conditions did not significantly outperform those in the control condition on the picture-word matching task. Another finding of this study was that participants reported use of both explicit (rule, memory) and implicit (guess, intuition) knowledge sources on the picture-word matching task. In conclusion, this study offers additional evidence concerning the roles of awareness and individual differences in second language learning, suggests ways to enhance the internal validity of research in this domain, and potentially informs future research on input modification as a pedagogic technique.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/relative-contribution-input-modification-learner/docview/1613188345/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Kim, Jiyoung",2014,The imperfective aspect in Korean: A panchronic approach,"The Korean construction - ko iss - is traditionally referred to as a progressive aspect marker. However, due to the different aspectual classifications of verbs in Korean and the multiple uses of the - ko iss - construction, it is not easy to determine its grammatical properties. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Korean - ko iss - construction and its different aspectual meanings in discourse. Claiming that consideration of discourse contexts is necessary to account for the semantic and grammatical nature of the - ko iss - construction, I attempted to address the different views and solve the ongoing disagreements on the aspectual classification of verbs in Korean and the grammatical category of the - ko iss - construction. Based on the results of the study analyzing naturally occurring discourse data, I suggest that the basic meaning of - ko iss - underlying all its current variant uses is “continuous status at reference time,” which fits better with the continuous aspect than the progressive aspect. With the extended meaning of the habitual, the - ko iss - construction is categorized as a general imperfective. The multiple uses of the - ko iss - construction can be accounted for by taking a diachronic perspective; in other words, the grammaticalization of - ko iss - and the context-dependent nature of this construction can explain its multiple uses in Modern Korean. I investigated the historical development of the - ko iss - construction in order to find the answer to the question of why the - ko iss - construction should have the general meaning that it does, along with its various context-dependent interpretations. Based on empirical evidence and grammaticalization theory, I confirmed that the grammaticalization of - ko iss - is the major factor responsible for its multiple uses in Modern Korean. Finally, I empirically investigated how L2 learners acquire the Korean aspect marker - ko iss - with respect to verb type and analyzed L2 Korean textbooks used by the participants at the time of the study. Based on the results of the experimental study and the problems found in the L2 textbooks, I suggest more effective methods of teaching the aspectual meanings of - ko iss - in the L2 classroom.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/imperfective-aspect-korean-panchronic-approach/docview/1611733303/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Boon, Erin Diane",2014,Heritage Welsh: a study of heritage language as the outcome of minority language acquisition and bilingualism,"This dissertation analyzes the language used by 20 adult heritage Welsh speakers now living in London, i.e., bilinguals who shifted to English dominance in childhood, and whose Welsh proficiencies now show divergences from baseline norms as a result of incomplete acquisition and attrition. The grammars of these heavily imbalanced bilinguals are compared with baseline informants (20 Welsh-dominant controls) on a narrative elicitation task, in which the informants tell the story of a children's wordless picture book ( Frog, Where Are You? by Mercer Mayer). The samples collected for this project (Appendix II.1) constitute the first corpus of heritage Welsh. Particular attention is paid to indicators of fluency (mean length of utterance, frequency of embedded clauses, speech rate, vocabulary recall delay, retraces, and retraces with correction), simplification in the system of initial consonant mutation, reanalysis of tense and aspect in verb construction, any non-native agreement morphology, and the availability of a null subject in the heritage Welsh samples. The heritage Welsh samples are examined for evidence that divergence in the heritage grammar results more from a trend toward simplification and access to Universal Grammar than influence from the speaker's dominant language, English. Part I investigates topics which are pertinent to the study of heritage language—its definition and connection to the Critical Period Hypothesis, the distinction between incomplete language acquisition and attrition, and theories of bilingual language systems. Part II details the analysis of the heritage Welsh samples in particular. The concluding remarks broaden the focus to the minority status of the baseline language in Wales, presenting the inevitability of heritage speakers there as well if childhood exposure to Welsh does not reach the critical level necessary for full native proficiency and if the language is not maintained in adulthood. This project introduces the terms ""heritage Welsh"" and ""heritage speaker"" into Welsh linguistics, and presents a framework with which to discuss this previously neglected category of bilinguals.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/heritage-welsh-study-language-as-outcome-minority/docview/1557741729/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Takeuchi, Miyuki",2014,Subject referential expressions and encoding of referential status in L2 narrative discourse by L1-English learners of Japanese,"This dissertation investigates the acquisition of subject referential expressions by L1-English learners of Japanese and classroom input as a possible contributor to non-target style usage among learners. The investigation utilizes a functional approach, examining how referential status is encoded through the use of subject referential forms: NP with a subject-marking particle ga, NP with a topic-marking particle wa, and null anaphora. Sixty-one learners, including university students in second, third, fourth-year Japanese classes and learners at advanced and high-advanced levels, as well as thirty-one native Japanese and English speakers, participated in the study. All performed two kinds of narrative tasks: storytelling of a picture book and film retell. Analyses of the narrative tasks indicate the following trends: (1) use of null anaphora for reference maintenance at early stages, (2) overuse of NP- wa at early stages, (3) delayed emergence of NP- ga to mark new information, and (4) overuse of NP- ga and persistent difficulty to acquire the functions of NP- wa among advanced and high-advanced learners. To examine the role of classroom input in the above trends, three Japanese textbooks were analyzed to ascertain to what degree and in what functions NP- ga , NP- wa , and null anaphora are used in the texts. The analysis shows that input of NP- ga is scarce compared to the other forms in the first-year textbook and explicit explanations of distinctions between ga and wa are lacking in the second and third-year textbooks. As a secondary source of classroom input, classroom discourse was analyzed, which found that NP- wa is more often used than other forms in teacher talk. These suggest that the overuse of NP-wa at early stages and delayed emergence of NP- ga found in the learners' narratives may be attributed to the input that they receive in classroom. Suggestions for improved pedagogy are presented at the end of the dissertation.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/subject-referential-expressions-encoding-status/docview/1545897572/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

The article offers an overview of research examining the role of identity in student sojourns abroad. This research includes (1) holistic, qualitative studies of the ways in which identities shape language learning opportunities, and (2) studies examining the development of specific, identity-related pragmatic abilities. After defining identity and study abroad, the researcher organizes this article in terms of salient demographic categories represented in the literature: nationality/""foreigner"" status, gender, linguistic inheritance, age status, and ethnicity. Where possible, examples of both holistic and pragmatics-oriented research are included for each category.

"Tomita, Naoko",2013,Strategies for linking information by German and Japanese native Speakers and by German learners of Japanese,"In these utterances, the information from the domain of ENTITY is encoded via the grammatical subject. [...]there are two options regarding the predominance within the topic part of the propositional structure: A. 'TIME &gt; ENTITY' : by placing the temporal adverb before the subject in the clause, the speaker can give preference to a newly introduced time span over the topic entity, indicating this:15 ( 18) jetzt ist auch herr grün aus dem fenster gesprungen. For segment 28, 9 of 20 Japanese speakers do not mention the event of fire, and 6 of these 9 speakers employ the adverbial 'still' in order to relate the information [Mr. Red's not-jumping] (segment 28) to the same information asserted for a previous span of time (segment 25). [...]it seems that the speaker - probably regardless of his/her language - could easily recognize the 'still'-relation between segment 25 and 28, if the interjacent event of fire is not involved in the retelling. In linking information concerning the main characters, the Japanese speakers typically organize a shift-in-ENTlTY with the additive particle -mo in order to mark that the same comment applies for different topic entities (analysis unit 1 ). [...]the comparisons invite the expectation that a parallel event to an event that already occurred in relation to one character will happen to another topic entity; its realization is then marked by the temporal adverb yooyaku 'finally (-(-expectation)' in sentence initial position and by the additive particle -mo 'also' (as in [23]). Complemented by the present author. 6. Because not one, but two propositional structures (segments 26 and 24) are involved in the linking pattern ? as antecedents, there seems to be a competition between a shift-in-ENTITY and a shift-in-TIME for predominance in information organization for segment 27.", General Information,10.1515/iral-2013-0006,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/strategies-linking-information-german-japanese/docview/1430244959/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Fernandez, Julieta",2013,Social networks and youngspeak in study abroad,"Interactions with experienced L2 speakers can have a positive effect on study abroad (SA) students’ language acquisition (e.g., development in informal vocabulary use, Schauer, 2009). Many SA students, however, experience difficulties in establishing social networks in Latin America (e.g., Isabelli-García, 2006). SA experience, therefore, cannot be automatically equated with language immersion (Kinginger, 2009). With these considerations in mind, this dissertation examines the development in SA students’ use of a specific group of Spanish lexical features that are characteristic of youngspeak (Stenström &amp; Jørgensen, 2009), i.e. the unplanned spoken discourse of undergraduate speakers, such as general extenders (Overstreet, 1999) (e.g., o algo así “or something like that”), discourse markers (e.g., tipo “like”) and colloquial words (e.g., chamuyar “sweet talk”). English L1 undergraduate participants (n=12) at different Spanish L2 proficiency levels were each paired with Argentine experienced speakers of Spanish for the duration of their 4-month sojourn. The conversation partners were 18- to 22-year-old undergraduate students at universities in Buenos Aires. The results revealed a number of trends in participants’ exposure to, use, and dispositions toward Argentine youngspeak and their relationship to participants’ ability or desire to establish social networks in Argentina. The results revealed that some participants saw the use of youngspeak as a hallmark of L2 proficiency, while others avoided it due to emotional risks. The informal interactions that the participants engaged in with their conversation partners did not always result in increased opportunities to learn informal language features. The majority of the participants reported interacting predominantly with their host families and learning most of the informal language features in their Spanish courses. These courses, however, were found to provide limited pedagogical framing of pragmatic functions and register variation. Implications for study abroad research, language development, and pedagogy are discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/social-networks-youngspeak-study-abroad/docview/1773389240/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Cabrelli Amaro, Jennifer Lauren",2013,The phonological permeability hypothesis: Measuring regressive L3 influence to test L1 and L2 phonological representations,"The Phonological Permeability Hypothesis (PPH, Cabrelli Amaro &amp; Rothman, 2010) attempts to reconcile evidence suggesting some L2 learners, however rare, attain native-like L2 phonological systems with the observation that most do not. Considering existing L2 phonology research, it is not clear that phonological differences between early and late acquirers must be the consequence of maturational effects on implicit mechanisms. Thus, to test how native-like adult-acquired systems are, the extent to which early- and late-acquired systems are equally resilient to influence from an L3 is examined. The PPH posits that native-like phonological systems acquired in adulthood are different from systems acquired in childhood with regards to relative stability. To test the PPH, a cross-sectional study of three types of English/Spanish bilinguals differing in age and context of acquisition (AoA) of Spanish was carried out to examine whether AoA determines relative vulnerability of the Spanish phonological system when exposed to L3 BP. In addition, a longitudinal case study was conducted, observing an L1 English/L2 Spanish bilingual’s Spanish prior to BP exposure, and his BP and Spanish after 11 weeks of BP immersion. The focus of the investigation was the acquisition of reduced word-final unstressed vowels [I] and [near-close near-back rounded vowel] in BP and potential regressive influence on the perception, production, and processing of Spanish word-final unstressed [e] and [o]. Results from the cross-sectional study did not reveal any between-group differences in perception, production, or reaction time in terms of BP influence on Spanish. Therefore, these data align with the possibility that AoA does not determine the relative stability of a phonological system in terms of mental representation or processing. However, while these data do not support the PPH, evidence meeting the criteria for falsification of the PPH is also lacking. The case study results are indicative of rapid and permeating L3 influence on the learner’s Spanish processing during speech production, and a large-scale longitudinal investigation of the three bilingual types tested here is necessary to reveal whether early and late acquirers of Spanish are equally vulnerable to L3 influence and what the nature of any observed vulnerability is.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/phonological-permeability-hypothesis-measuring/docview/1520189172/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Chung, Eun Seon",2013,Exploring the degree of native-likeness in bilingual acquisition: Second and heritage language acquisition of Korean case-ellipsis,"The primary objective of this dissertation is to investigate how early and late bilinguals attain implicit knowledge of Korean case ellipsis (CE) that necessitates integration of multiple types of information and poses many learnability problems for the learners. The present research examines similarities and differences between the different types of bilinguals as well as between monolingual and bilingual populations. An oral picture description task and a written forced-choice elicitation task are developed to investigate how different populations employ the relevant factors in Korean CE and if certain types of cues are more accessible than others. The results reveal qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic knowledge of early vs. late bilinguals with heritage language learners (i.e., early bilinguals) achieving a higher level of mastery than second language learners (i.e., late bilinguals) in both oral and written tasks. It seems possible for heritage language learners to attain implicit knowledge of Korean CE, and parallels can be drawn between these learners and monolingual children. Second language learners, on the other hand, showed divergent and variable patterns in judgment and production, which question their ability to acquire the phenomenon. The results underline the importance of age, context, and mode of acquisition in bilingual acquisition as the learners showed a tendency to depend on factors/cues that are more readily available to them in their respective context and mode of acquisition. The effects of task and structural priming are also discussed. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that different types of bilinguals process and acquire the phenomenon of Korean CE differently, and that bilingual difficulty does not lie in particular domains but is more computational in nature with learners failing to effectively incorporate multiple levels of information in a native-like manner.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-degree-native-likeness-bilingual/docview/1517975120/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Fafulas, Stephen",2013,First and second-language patterns of variation: Acquisition and use of simple present and present progressive forms in spanish and english,"This investigation addresses the acquisition of the present progressive, and the variation of this form with the simple present, by English-speaking learners of Spanish in the US. Empirical research on the variation of these forms by native speakers (NS) of English and Spanish, and, in particular the acquisition of the present progressive by nonnative speakers (NNS) of Spanish is scarce. While seeking to fill this void in the literature, a second major contribution of this project is the extension of the analysis to a broad range of progressive constructions. Relatively little is known about how English-speaking learners of Spanish deal with the differences between the uses of the simple present and present progressive forms in these two languages. At what level of proficiency do they begin to employ both forms, in similar contexts as NS of Spanish? Do they acquire the full range of progressive constructions, and sensitivity to the same linguistic predictors of use, found in NS grammars? The current study will empirically answer these questions through the use of film narrations, written contextualized questionnaires, and surveys of language-learning experiences, from 115 participants. Results indicate that as learners of Spanish gain proficiency they move toward a second-language grammar which permits variation between the simple present and present progressive forms as is found in native speaker grammars. However, while learners at the highest levels acquire the linguistic constraints guiding native speaker selection of the simple present and present progressive form, they do not acquire the full-range of lexical forms used to express progressive aspect found in monolingual Spanish. These findings have implications for current contact-induced and interlanguage theories on Spanish-English grammatical development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/first-second-language-patterns-variation/docview/1502869040/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Smith, Jenna Lynn",2013,Style shifting in Japanese native/non-native conversation: an in depth analysis of short/long form usage,"There are two distinct styles of predicates in Japanese: the long form and the short form. The former is associated with politeness/formality, while the latter is reserved for more intimate social settings. It is expected that when the relationship of the speakers and the setting remains the same, speakers will use one form. However, studies on native speakers show mixing of the two forms, known as style shifting, occurs even when the factors mentioned earlier remain constant. This study examines short and long form usage and style shifting in conversations between native and non-native speakers. Similar to native speakers, the majority of native/non-native dyads shared a dominant speech style, and all speakers (including the non-native speakers) engaged in style shifting. A closer look at individual conversations showed the non-native speakers' awareness of what forms they were using, and evidence of style shifting serving specific discourse functions.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/style-shifting-japanese-native-non-conversation/docview/1501439126/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Sondermann, Kerstin",2013,"Bilingual gestures: The ""manual"" way of informing the notion of 'balanced bilinguals'","Defining what makes a person bilingual is notoriously difficult and dependent on various factors like fluency, age of acquisition, and situational context, among others. The notion of a `balanced bilingual' is even more elusive and fraught with limitations regarding the proper assessment and linguistic profiling of bilinguals, leading to different categorizations of what constitutes a `balanced bilingual' among researchers. The present study attempted to address this issue by drawing on other, non-verbal clues provided by bilingual speakers: their gestures. Studies have shown that speakers of languages that are typologically different (see Talmy, 1985) tend to gesture in distinct patterns when describing motion events (see, e.g., Kellerman &amp; VanHoof, 2003; Kita &amp; Özyürek, 2003; McNeill &amp; Duncan, 2000). These patterns have been found to be highly resistant to change when acquiring a typologically distinct language (see Gullberg, de Bot, &amp; Volterra, 2008). This study took a qualitative look at the gestures produced by nine bilingual speakers of English and Spanish when narrating motion events in both languages. The goal of this research was to examine the gestural behavior of balanced bilinguals, to determine to what extent — if any — their gesture patterns can be compared to those that have been suggested for monolinguals as well as L2 learners based on the available literature, and to see what these patterns can reveal about the cognitive processes underlying the speech and gesture production of these bilinguals. A detailed analysis of the speech and gesture patterns of all participants revealed several trends that - despite considerable individual variation — set the group of balanced bilinguals apart from what we currently know about English and Spanish monolinguals, as well as L2 learners. Gesture patterns were predominantly in sync with the typological patterns used in speech, yet there was also evidence of a blended ""hybrid"" system, which — often by means of subtle differences in the timing and alignment of gestures — allowed speakers access to a wider variety of gesture patterns than would otherwise be the case. In many instances, gestures provided valuable insights into how motion events were conceptualized, which speech alone would have been unable to convey.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/bilingual-gestures-manual-way-informing-notion/docview/1491390140/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Kim, Eun Ho",2013,Development of interactional competence in L2 Korean: The use of Korean interpersonal modal endings -<i>canh</i>- and -<i>ketun</i>,"This study investigates the ways in which Korean interpersonal modal endings – canh - and – ketun are used and developed as interactional resources by L2 speakers. Using the methodology of conversation analysis, this study not only examines how speakers employ – canh - and – ketun in the formation of an action, but also compares the (non) use of these endings by L2 speakers at different proficiency levels. By taking this combined approach to the use and the development of grammatical resources by L2 speakers, this dissertation aims to (1) investigate the ways in which L2 speakers use – canh - and – ketun to accomplish certain social actions, such as giving accounts or disagreeing, by displaying relevant knowledge states and (2) illustrate the stages of L2 speakers’ development that correlate to interactional competence in the use of these linguistic resources. The data of the current study comes from approximately 240 hours of video-recorded classroom interactions in a Korean as a second language context. Focusing on three different sequential environments recurrently associated with opportunities to use – canh - and – ketun to accomplish particular actions, this study presents detailed descriptions of how participants’ use and nonuse of these forms work as resources for dealing with varied epistemic access to proposed information in talk-in-interaction. By adopting a cross-sectional design for comparison, this study also shows developmental patterns in the use of – canh - and – ketun by L2 speakers of Korean. Close scrutiny of the use and nonuse of these resources reveals whether and to what extent their interactional use by L2 speakers of different proficiency levels approaches that of L1 speakers. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of Korean interpersonal modal endings in terms of the management and distribution of information as expressed through speakers’ actions. This study also contributes to the growing body of research that takes a CA approach to the development of interactional competence by L2 speakers. It is hoped that this study both yields insights into how language use can be fully understood by adding the factors of management of information, and promotes CA approach to research on Korean L2 interaction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-interactional-competence-l2-korean/docview/1468460374/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Tai, Shu-Ju",2013,From TPACK-in-Action workshops to English classrooms: CALL competencies developed and adopted into classroom teaching,"As researchers in the CALL teacher education field noted, teachers play the pivotal role in the language learning classrooms because they are the gate keepers who decide whether technology or CALL has a place in their teaching, and they select technology to support their teaching, which determines what CALL activities language learners are exposed to and how learners use them (Hubbard 2008). While a considerable amount of research related to CALL teacher education has focused on teachers' attitudes, beliefs, and confidence regarding CALL (e.g., Kamhi-Stein, 2000; Kassen &amp; Higgins, 1997; Lam, 2000; Peters, 2006; van Olphen, 2007), there are very few studies that have investigated the impact of CALL teacher education programs (Desjardins &amp; Peters, 2007; Hegelheimer, 2006; Kessler, 2007; Kilickaya, 2009). These studies reported that teachers confirmed their learning and adoption of CALL into their classroom teaching; however, the findings are based on self-report data, which are insufficient for capturing actual classrooms CALL integration. Moreover, the Call for Papers in the January 2013 issue of the Language Learning and Technology Journal calls for research in CALL teacher education to ""address another crucial factor affecting the degree and quality of implementation: teachers' CALL competencies and knowledge base"" (p. 145). In view of the need to bridge the gap and to develop a fuller picture of how teachers integrate CALL in the classrooms, the present study used an observation instrument based on the TPACK framework (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) to investigate the impact of TPACK-in-Action workshops had on English teachers in Taiwan from four different perspectives: whether the CALL workshops (1) met participants' expectations in helping them integrate CALL; (2) contributed to participants' perception change toward CALL and CALL integration; (3) helped participants develop their TPACK competencies; and (4) helped participants adopt the learned CALL competencies into their classrooms. The 15-hour TPACK-in-Action CALL workshops were conducted as part of the teacher professional development for 24 elementary English Teachers in Taiwan. The TPACK-in-Action model (Tai &amp; Chuang, 2012), developed specifically to help English teachers integrate CALL, was employed to guide the design of the workshops. Situated in the mixed methods research design with the guidance of the TPACK framework, qualitative data through reflections, interviews, and observations, and quantitative data through surveys and reflections, were collected before, during, and after the CALL workshops to help identify the impact of the TPACK-in-Action workshops. Findings of the present study showed that the TPACK-in-Action CALL workshops had a strong and positive impact on elementary English teachers in Taiwan. In addition to helping them showing positive perception changes toward CALL integration, it was observed that the workshops helped participants develop CALL competencies, such as integrating online materials, using cloud computing for student interaction, selecting appropriate technology for content teaching, and matching the affordance of technology to their instructional goals and pedagogy as well as adopt the learned competencies into classroom teaching. Findings indicated that observations were found to be effective in investigating the impact of the TPACK-in-Action CALL workshops. Not only were observation data triangulated with self-report data to prevent potential discrepancies from happening, they helped identify teachers' CALL competencies and visualize their CALL integration. In sum, this dissertation contributed to providing empirical evidence on the effect of using observation as a measure to understand how teachers integrate CALL in their classrooms and adding a new perspective while investigating CALL teacher education. It also has theoretical implication for CALL teacher education research and pedagogical implications for CALL teacher education practice", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/tpack-action-workshops-english-classrooms-call/docview/1450065611/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Tecedor Cabrero, Marta",2013,Developing interactional competence through video-based computer-mediated conversations: Beginning learners of Spanish,"This dissertation examines the discourse produced by beginning learners of Spanish using social media. Specifically, it looks at the use and development of interactional resources during two video-mediated conversations. Through a combination of Conversation Analysis tools and quantitative data analysis, the use of turn-taking strategies, repair trajectories, and alignment moves was examined to discover how beginning language learners manage videoconferencing exchanges and develop their interactional capabilities in this new interactional setting. The goal of this investigation was twofold: 1) to describe and explain how students construct, manage and maintain conversations via videoconferencing, and 2) to gain a better understanding of the links between technology-based social media and language learning. The results of this study indicate that instructional videoconferencing conversations display their own clearly delimited and idiosyncratic organization of interactional features. In terms of turn-taking, the results of the analyses demonstrate that beginning learners are fully capable of participating competently in speaker selection to manage a conversation with a peer of similar proficiency level. In the area of repair, the analyses show that, during instructional videoconferencing exchanges, beginning learners orient to both the communication of personal meaning and the accuracy of their discourse. They enact this orientation through the use of self-initiated self-repair. Finally, with regard to the use of alignment moves, the analyses reveal that, in tune with their nascent linguistic and interactional abilities, beginning learners use primarily acknowledgement moves.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/developing-interactional-competence-through-video/docview/1443852260/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Duff, Patricia A",2014,Case Study Research on Language Learning and Use,"Case study research has played a very important role in applied linguistics since the field was established, particularly in studies of language teaching, learning, and use. The case in such studies generally has been a person (e.g., a teacher, learner, speaker, writer, or interlocutor) or a small number of individuals on their own or in a group (e.g., a family, a class, a work team, or a community of practice). The cases are normally studied in depth in order to provide an understanding of individuals' experiences, issues, insights, developmental pathways, or performance within a particular linguistic, social, or educational context. Rather than discuss constructs, hypotheses, and findings in terms of statistical patterns or trends derived from a larger sample or survey of a population of language learners, as in some quantitative research, a qualitative case study of a person presents a contextualized human profile. Case study has contributed substantially to theory development, generating new perspectives or offering a refutation or refinement of earlier theories in applied linguistics by analyzing linguistic, cultural, and social phenomena associated with children, adolescents, young adults, and older adults. In recent years, the purview of case studies in applied linguistics has expanded to include many previously underrepresented topics, linguistic situations, theoretical perspectives, and populations. This article provides an overview of some traditional areas of coverage and then newer foci in terms of methodology, thematic areas, and findings pertaining to language learners in transnational, multilingual, and diaspora contexts especially.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0267190514000051,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/case-study-research-on-language-learning-use/docview/1638978600/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Canner, Marc T.",2013,Working Memory-Learning Condition Interactions Proficiency in L2 Russian under Naturalistic and Formal Learning Conditions,"The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the relationships between working memory (WM) and three commonly used learning strategies or conditions in the nature of proficiency among adult L2 Russian learners. Based on the aptitude-learning condition interaction framework articulated by Robinson (2002b), the study identifies two types of relationships between the fixed variables of working memory and learning condition, and four variables related to second language proficiency (SLP) in Russian: accuracy, fluency, overall general proficiency or `native-likeness', and the occurrence of potentially fossilized forms in speech. Three main learning contexts were identified, including strictly naturalistic conditions resulting from immersion in-country (NC), naturalistic learning followed by formal learning experiences (NF), and formal training followed by naturalistic learning through immersion (FN). 37 participants were recruited, including naturalistic learners (n = 12), naturalistic/formal (n = 12), and formal/naturalistic participants (n=13). A proficiency interview was used to test learners for their L2 Russian proficiency, including measures for fluency, overall proficiency or native-likeness, accuracy via the elicitation of three prevalent structures in native speech, and the presence of potentially fossilized inter language (IL) forms. Based on proficiency scores and answers provided on an experience-related questionnaire, three experiments were conducted. The first experiment tests for predictive relationships between WM and the four aspects of proficiency for each learning condition. The second experiment investigates potential interactions between WM and the three learning conditions in relation to the main aspects of proficiency. A third experiment tests for correlations between the amount of formal training and accuracy-related measures for the two combined (NF and FN) learning contexts. The results of a logistic regression indicate significant predictive correlations between working memory and accuracy, and a negative correlation with the rate of potential fossilization for the naturalistic condition. No predictive significance for WM alone and aspects of proficiency was found in either NF or FN conditions. The second experiment yielded results indicating a significant interaction between WM and naturalistic conditions for fluency, and significance for interactions between WM and the amount of formal training for both accuracy and general proficiency for the formal/naturalistic (FN) context. The third experiment found predictive correlations between the amount of formal training and fossilization for the FN condition. The study found no significant correlations for the NF context. Results are interpreted to signify differential effects in relationships between WM and the major aspects of proficiency among different conditions, with an evident impact of the order or sequence of naturalistic and formal experience for the combined contexts. It appears that working memory does not act alone, but interacts with the nature of learning conditions to affect proficiency. Significant correlations between the amount of formal instruction and accuracy-related measures including fossilization are indicated.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/working-memory-learning-condition-interactions/docview/1431980786/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Kasper, Gabriele;Wagner, Johannes",2014,Conversation Analysis in Applied Linguistics,"For the last decade, conversation analysis (CA) has increasingly contributed to several established fields in applied linguistics. In this article, we will discuss its methodological contributions. The article distinguishes between basic and applied CA. Basic CA is a sociological endeavor concerned with understanding fundamental issues of talk in action and of intersubjectivity in human conduct. The field has expanded its scope from the analysis of talk--often phone calls--towards an integration of language with other semiotic resources for embodied action, including space and objects. Much of this expansion has been driven by applied work. After laying out CA's standard practices of data treatment and analysis, this article takes up the role of comparison as a fundamental analytical strategy and reviews recent developments into cross-linguistic and cross-cultural directions. The remaining article focuses on applied CA, the application of basic CA's principles, methods, and findings to the study of social domains and practices that are interactionally constituted. We consider three strands--foundational, social problem oriented, and institutional applied CA--before turning to recent developments in CA research on learning and development. In conclusion, we address some emerging themes in the relationship of CA and applied linguistics, including the role of multilingualism, standard social science methods as research objects, CA's potential for direct social intervention, and increasing efforts to complement CA with quantitative analysis.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0267190514000014,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/conversation-analysis-applied-linguistics/docview/1638979480/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Pae, Hye K;Schanding, Brian;Kwon, Yeon-jin;Lee, Yong-won",2014,Animacy Effect and Language Specificity: Judgment of Unaccusative Verbs by Korean Learners of English as a Foreign Language,"This study investigated the tendency of overpassivization of unaccusative verbs by Korean learners of English as a foreign language (FL). Sixty Korean native college students participated in the study, along with 17 English-speaking counterparts serving as a comparison group. Consistent with the findings of previous research, this study found Korean students' tendency to incorrectly accept passive-voice with inanimate subjects. The results of this study highlighted the role of lexical animacy, the hierarchy of agentivity, and language-specific effects on FL judgment. The findings of this study suggest a robust language-specific L1 effect on L2 acquisition and a greater involvement of cognition in FL use than language input.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"," Feature , Journal Article",10.1007/s10936-013-9246-6,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/animacy-effect-language-specificity-judgment/docview/1502963308/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Schimke, Sarah;Colonna, Saveria",2016,Native and nonnative interpretation of pronominal forms,"This study investigates the influence of grammatical role and discourse-level cues on the interpretation of different pronominal forms in native speakers of French, native speakers of Turkish, and Turkish learners of French. In written questionnaires, we found that native speakers of French were influenced by discourse-level cues when interpreting ambiguous overt subject pronouns in French, whereas native speakers of Turkish were mainly influenced by a syntactic cue--subjecthood--when interpreting null subjects (pro) in Turkish translation equivalents. When interpreting implicit subjects of nonfinite dependent clauses (PRO), native speakers of both French and Turkish were influenced by subjecthood. Finally, Turkish learners of French were influenced by discourse-level cues in the interpretation of overt pronouns as well as PRO and showed no subject preference in either case. These results are in line with approaches to second language (L2) acquisition that stress the role of discourse-level principles in the processing and use of a L2 (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006; Klein &amp; Perdue, 1997).", Journal Article,10.1017/S0272263115000303,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/native-nonnative-interpretation-pronominal-forms/docview/1771111696/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Oshita, H",2000,What is happened may not be what appears to be happening: a corpus study of 'passive' unaccusatives in L2 English,"Second Language (L2) researchers have been studying 'passive' unaccusative errors such as What was happened?, but have not yet reached a consensus about the ultimate cause of this unique interlanguage structure. This article critically reviews five major accounts proposed in the literature, namely: * transfer of a compound tense/aspect structure in the learner's first language (L1); * overgeneralization of adjectival passive formation in English; * nontarget lexical causativization; * identification of the passive morphosyntax with the lack of a logical subject; and * nontarget overt marking of syntactic NP movement. By analysing each account in terms of its ramifications in light of the data already available in the literature and additional data from a large corpus of nonnative English, I demonstrate that the most plausible account of the 'passive' unaccusative structure is to regard it as an overt marker of NP movement, an overgeneralization of the passive morphosyntax of the target English.", Original article,10.1177/026765830001600401,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/what-is-happened-may-not-be-appears-happening/docview/200252423/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Xiao, Feng",2016,Proficiency effect on L2 pragmatic competence,"This paper synthesizes cross-sectional studies of the effect of proficiency on second language (L2) pragmatics to answer the synthesis question: Does proficiency affect adult learners’ pragmatic competence? Findings have revealed an overall positive proficiency effect on pragmatic competence, and in most cases higher proficiency learners have higher pragmatic competence. However, increased proficiency does not guarantee a native-like pragmatic performance because proficiency effect varies depending on the nature of target pragmatic features such as types of speech acts (degrees of directness and conventionality) (e.g., Cook &amp; Liddicoat, 2002; Félix-Brasdefer, 2007), modalities of pragmatic performance (comprehension and production) (e.g., Bradovi-Harlig, 2008, 2009), social variables involved in task situations, such as social status (e.g., Allami &amp; Naeimi, 2011), social distance (e.g., Maeshiba, Yoshinaga, Kasper, &amp; Ross, 1996), and power relationship (e.g., Al-Gahtani &amp; Roever, 2012). Moreover, proficiency effect is mediated by contextual variables such as length of stay in the target language community (e.g., Shardakova, 2005; Taguchi, 2011, 2013; Xu, Case, &amp; Wang, 2009).", Journal Article,10.14746/sllt.2015.5.4.3,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/proficiency-effect-on-l2-pragmatic-competence/docview/2771789114/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"MITSUGI, SANAKO;MACWHINNEY, BRIAN",2016,The use of case marking for predictive processing in second language Japanese,"Research on processing in English has shown that verb information facilitates predictive processing. Because Japanese verbs occur at the ends of clauses, this information cannot be used to predict the roles of preceding nominals. Kamide, Altmann and Haywood (2003) showed that native Japanese speakers use case markers to predict forthcoming linguistic items. In the present study, we investigated whether second language learners of Japanese demonstrate such predictive effects when processing sentences containing either the monotransitive or ditransitive constructions. A visual-world paradigm experiment showed that, although native speakers generated predictions for syntactic outcomes, the learners did not. These findings underscore the usefulness of morphosyntactic information in processing Japanese and indicate that learners fail to make full use of case markers to generate expectations regarding syntactic outcomes during online processing. Learners may rely on nonlinguistic information to compensate for this deficit in syntactic processing.", Journal Article,10.1017/S1366728914000881,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/use-case-marking-predictive-processing-second/docview/1879249496/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Visualization technologies have proven useful in intonation instruction, and increasing pitch movement height and magnitude, while also spectrally limiting the speech stream may provide ways to raise the salience of intonation for learners as well. Nineteen participants were provided a pre and posttest between which they received either LPF training, Non-Filtered training, or no training. All input was given using the characteristics of Infant Directed Speech, providing, among other features, increased pitch movement height and magnitude. It was predicted that the LPF training would increase the accuracy of learners.

"Shleykina, Galina",2016,The speech act of greeting performed by Russian EFL learners,"The present study centers on interlanguage and cross-cultural pragmatics. It investigates semantic formulas in the speech act of greeting performed by Russian EFL learners. In particular, it compares the non-native speakers’ (NNS) and native speakers’ (NS) production of semantic formulas in terms of their number, frequency, and content. Secondly, the study examines the NSs’ perception of NNS greetings for their pragmatic appropriateness and identifies areas that influence the ratings. A Free Discourse Completion Test (FDCT) containing 16 situational prompts was used to elicit greetings by the English NNSs and NSs. Retrospective interviews were additionally administered to triangulate the data. The NNSs’ greetings were rated by the NS raters on a four-point scale for their pragmatic appropriateness. The results show that the NNSs significantly deviate from the NSs in terms of number, frequency, and content of greetings strategies, namely, greetings proper, phatic questions and phrases, address terms, and situational greetings. The differences result from negative pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic transfer, lack of appropriate linguistic means, or not fully developed pragmatic competence. The NNS greetings were rated as pragmatically appropriate in general; however, several areas including grammatical and sociopragmatic factors led to lowering the scores. The NSs’ ratings as well as NNSs’ production can be regarded in view of socio-cultural differences in communication styles between Russian and English cultures. These dissimilarities in sociopragmatic behavior may account for low ratings from the NSs’ perspective and for frequencies of certain semantic formulas in the NNSs’ production as well. Finally, important pedagogical implications regarding pragmatic instruction are discussed. The results contribute to a better understanding of how Russian EFL learners greet and respond to greetings in English. They also shed light on the discussion of L2 learners’ pragmatic competence and NS perception of pragmatic appropriateness.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/speech-act-greeting-performed-russian-efl/docview/1853871241/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Kim, Hyun-Jin",2016,Sentence processing and the L2 acquisition of the semantics and discourse function of the English past progressive,"Previous research has found that learners’ use of tense-aspect morphology is strongly dependent on the aspectual semantics of the verb phrase. However, the processes underlying the acquisition of semantic values of aspectual morphemes are still not well understood. I investigated the acquisition of the semantics of the progressive morphology -ing in past progressive sentences by second language (L2) learners from the point of view of learning as a by-product of the parsing task. The central research question is: How is a semantic value for aspectual -ing computed and identified in L2 sentence processing? Two learning-theoretic hypotheses were formulated: (1) the predicate-based semantics selection hypothesis representing hypothesis-testing and (2) the transition-based semantics selection hypothesis representing a deductive learning. L2 learners of intermediate and advanced English proficiency from typologically different L1s, Korean and Chinese, were engaged in a written film retell, a verb cloze, a judgment task, and two online processing tasks (garden-path and ellipsis tasks). Across tasks, the results showed coherent patterns distinguishing learners by proficiency but not by L1 background. In processing by higher-proficiency learners, the -ing morphology resulted in the anticipation of activity predicates. Learners’ narratives associated -ing and -ed morphology with activities and accomplishment respectively. In processing by lower-proficiency learners, the -ing morphology resulted in the anticipation of an accomplishment predicate. Their production behavior did not show the strong association of -ing morphology with activities. These patterns suggest deductive computations involving a set of transitions in an event schema that includes a culmination. The lower proficiency learners failed to complete all transitions to progressive states/process stages in the processing of past progressive sentences. The higher proficiency group’s recovery of analysis, in contrast, signals the reliable computation of progressive states/process stages semantics for past progressive sentences. The findings emphasize the role of deductive parsing in the acquisition of tense and aspect.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/sentence-processing-l2-acquisition-semantics/docview/1848288668/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Burch, Alfred Rue",2016,Motivation in interaction: A conversation-analytic perspective,"Over the past decade, the field of L2 motivation research has begun to turn its focus toward what Dörnyei and Ushioda (2010) have termed “socio-complexity” approaches, following recent trends in the wider field of SLA that incorporate discursive and usage-based methodologies (Atkinson, 2011; Cadierno &amp; Eskildsen, 2015; Firth &amp; Wagner, 1997; 2007; Ortega, 2013). These socio-complexity approaches, including Ushioda’s (2009) “person-in-context” perspective, Dörnyei’s (2005; 2009) “L2 motivation self system” and various Complexity/ Dynamic Systems Theory (CDST) approaches (Dörnyei, 2014; Dörnyei, MacIntyre &amp; Henry, 2015; MacIntyre, 2012; MacIntyre &amp; Legatto, 2011), though eclectic in focus and methodology, have all begun to step away from the assumptions of context as background variable and individual differences as psychological traits that have dominated much of the previous L2 motivation research, to instead view motivation as dynamically changing and socially contextualized on multiple timescales, and more importantly, have come to recognize that “L2 learner” is just one of many potentially relevant situated identities (Zimmerman, 1998) for those interacting in their L2s (Firth &amp; Wagner, 1997; Ushioda, 2009). This study contributes to this dynamic and contextualized perspective at the interactional time scale by utilizing EMCA (Ethnomethodology/Conversation Analysis) as it has been applied to second language acquisition (or CA-SLA; see Kasper &amp; Wagner, 2011; 2014)—including sequential analysis (Schegloff, 2007), membership categorization analysis (Fitzgerald &amp; Housley, 2015; Stokoe, 2012), discursive psychology (Edwards &amp; Potter, 1992; 2005) and a focus on embodied interaction (Streeck, Goodwin &amp; LeBaron, 2011)—to analyze mundane Japanese as a Second Language interactions. The data follows Peony, an L2 speaker of Japanese, in video recordings of interactions between her and her L1 speaking friends and family collected over the course of 13 months. The analysis focuses on the actions and interactional projects that Peony and her co-participants undertake and co-construct, and takes into account the linguistic, embodied, and material resources that they employ, in order to develop a perspective that focuses on motivation as socially viewable, accountable, and accomplished. In particular, this study focuses on three aspects of motivation-in-interaction: 1) persistence , or the sustained orientation (often through interactional difficulty) toward an interactional goal, 2) initiative , or engagement and participation at points where it would not be noticeably absent or accountable to not engage, and 3) motivation as topic , focusing on Peony’s self-assessments of her Japanese ability and her accounts regarding the efforts she makes towards studying the language. The analysis reveals that while there are indeed times that Peony’s effort is oriented toward specific learning objects, much of her effort is exerted towards other situated identities such as being an attentive friend or family member. Furthermore, the sequential nature of persistence and engagement, and Peony’s relationships with her co-participants on one hand, and the relationships with others that are invoked in her conversations, with their concomitant category bound rights and obligations on the other, make clear that motivation at the interactional level is very much a matter of mundane morality (Jayussi, 1984; 1991).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/motivation-interaction-conversation-analytic/docview/1847950575/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Xu, Jun",2016,An analysis of the Japanese sentence final particle <i> yone</i>,"The Japanese sentence final particle yone is commonly used as a tag-like question corresponding to “isn’t it?” or “right?” in English. yone is also commonly used to show agreement. Another sentence final particle, ne , is considered as sharing those two functions with yone . However, they are not always interchangeable because there are cases in which yone or ne is the only possible choice; the alternate choice results in an unnatural utterance. This indicates that a simple description of the functions of yone as a tag-like question or showing agreement cannot provide a clear picture of its use. Situated in a discourse and functional framework, the present study analyzes the use of yone as a tag-like question and response with invented and naturally occurring conversation data. The present study argues that when yone is used as a tag-like question, it is associated with explicit or implied cognitive or interactional incongruity while ne encodes that the speaker assumes no difference of understanding or knowledge between conversation participants. Three types of incongruity have been identified in the present study. Type I and Type II are associated with an incongruity of the speaker’s understanding or an existing incongruity because the information belongs more to the hearer than the speaker. Type I indicates that the speaker is not completely certain about the information while in Type II the speaker feels completely certain about the information. yone is used because the information belongs more to the hearer. Type III is associated with a disalignment between the speaker and interactant. yone is used when disalignment appears and the speaker feels the necessity to seek support from the addressee to justify one’s position. Type III also appears in a situation where the addressee does not respond to what the speaker asks or requests. When yone is used in responses, including showing agreement, it indicates the speaker’s previously held recognition while ne presents the speaker’s here-and-now recognition. Examples are examined in four situations: i) response to immediate situations; ii) response to the speaker’s already-known information; iii) response to the answer to a question; and iv) response to assessment.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/analysis-japanese-sentence-final-particle-i-yone/docview/1845890554/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Shoji, Shinichi",2016,The Repeated Name Penalty and the Overt Pronoun Penalty in Japanese,"This research investigated the Repeated Name Penalty (RNP) and the Overt Pronoun Penalty (OPP) in Japanese. The RNP was first reported by Gordon, Grosz and Gilliom (1993), who observed that English sentences with repeated-name subject anaphors were read slower than sentences with overt-pronoun subjects when the antecedents were either the grammatical subject or the first-mentioned surface-initial noun phrase of the previous sentence. The OPP has been reported in studies of Spanish (Gelormini-Lezama &amp; Almor, 2011) in which sentences with overt-pronoun subject anaphors were read slower than sentences with null-pronoun subject anaphors for subject antecedents. A concern with the RNP and OPP is that, in most previously tested languages, the grammatical subject of a sentence is typically also its discourse topic. Thus, it remains unclear whether these effects are attributable to the anaphors’ subject-hood or to their topic-hood. To address this question, the present study examined the RNP and the OPP in Japanese, a language that distinctly utilizes the topic-subject and non-topic-subject. In addition, while the existing studies controlled saliences of antecedents by grammatical status (i.e., subject vs. object), the present study utilized the information-structurally different antecedents, namely topic vs. non-topic (both were grammatical subjects in this dissertation study), and the non-linguistic aspects, empathy locus vs. non-empathy locus (both were grammatical subjects in this dissertation study). The present study consisted of six self-paced sentence-by-sentence reading experiments with native Japanese speakers. The results showed that when antecedents were subjects or objects, the RNP and the OPP were detected only when anaphors were non-topic with the nominative-postposition, ga, but not topic anaphors with the topic-postposition, wa. The outcomes indicate that the topic-hood of anaphors activated immediate anaphoric interpretation. In contrast, when the antecedents were the topic or non-topic, the processing of anaphors with wa showed a marginal RNP, and anaphors with ga elicited no RNP. The results are attributed to the differences in salience between the antecedents and the function of the postpositions. Finally, although the different empathy statuses of antecedents elicited neither the RNP nor OPP, a closer examination of the results found a marginal OPP, likely reflecting the anti-logophoricity of overt pronouns in Japanese. Overall, these results indicate that the topic-hood of anaphors should be considered in studies of the RNP and OPP and that the saliences of antecedents may be dependent on non-grammatical aspects such as discourse topic or empathy status in addition to grammatical status.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/repeated-name-penalty-overt-pronoun-japanese/docview/1845018035/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Hara, Yoshiyuki",2016,The Perceptions of the Japanese Imperfective Aspect Marker –<i>Teiru</i> among Native Speakers and L2 Learners of Japanese,"The Japanese imperfective aspect marker –teiru is one of the most widely researched tense/aspect markers because of its multiple semantic functions. It has been claimed that the –teiru form can describe two main aspectual meanings, progressive and resultative, depending on the lexical aspect of the attached verb. The present study aims to empirically investigate native speakers’ interpretations of the –teiru meaning with different verb and sentence types through a judgment test. It compares them with the predicted semantic categories from the previous studies, which based their conclusion upon introspective analysis, as well as perceptions of L2 Japanese learners. The results suggest that overall perceptional patterns are consistent with predicted descriptions but also that interpretations of the meaning are flexible to some extent. As for learners’ perceptions, the results indicate that L2 learners develop progressive semantic processing in Japanese faster than resultative semantic processing in Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/perceptions-japanese-imperfective-aspect-marker-i/docview/1808261295/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Smith, Megan",2016,Testing the shallow structure hypothesis in L2 Japanese,"Language processing heuristics are one of the possible sources of divergence between first and second language systems. The Shallow Structure Hypothesis (SSH) (Clahsen and Felser, 2006) proposes that non-native language processing relies primarily on semantic, and not syntactic, information, and that second language (L2) processing is therefore necessarily less sensitive to syntactic constraints than native language (L1) processing. The SSH further predicts that regardless of whether a participant’s L1 and L2 instantiate the same structure, L2 processing will always be less sensitive to structural constraints. The present dissertation tests these claims in non-native Japanese processing. L1 English and L1 Korean speakers completed a self-paced reading task that tested their ability to rely on case particles to project clause structure in relative clauses, their sensitivity to wh- dependencies, and their ambiguity resolution preferences. Results suggest that L1 English and L1 Korean speakers rely on case particles to project structure, but that they diverge from native Japanese speakers with respect to whether projecting a second clause facilitates the processing of the head noun of the relative clause. Results also suggest that both groups of L2 Japanese speakers are sensitive to wh- dependencies in canonical wh- biclausal sentences, but only the L1 English group is in the scrambled ones. Ambiguity resolution preferences for both L2 groups converge on native-like preferences. These results are incompatible with the predictions of the SSH. The role of L2 literacy and syntactic knowledge in language processing is also discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/testing-shallow-structure-hypothesis-l2-japanese/docview/1793940458/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

The results show a strong correlation between high degrees of learner engagement, as captured in the profile portraits, and the three measures of sociolinguistic and linguistic performance. The longitudinal data point to an increase over time both of levels of engagement and of use of informal sociolinguistic variants. By measuring the impact of learners' evolving engagement on their use of sociolinguistic variants as they progress to a more advanced level of proficiency in their L2, the present study shows that an index of engagement can usefully summarize the multiple effects captured by the learner profile portraits and can shed light on rates of use of certain forms.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0272263114000369,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/engagement-portraits-socio-linguistic-performance/docview/1703896169/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"VanPatten, Bill;Smith, Megan",2015,APTITUDE AS GRAMMATICAL SENSITIVITY AND THE INITIAL STAGES OF LEARNING JAPANESE AS A L2: PARAMETRIC VARIATION AND CASE MARKING,"In this article, we challenge the notion that aptitude--operationalized as grammatical sensitivity as measured by the Words in Sentences section of the Modern Language Aptitude Test--is central to adult second language (L2) acquisition. We present the findings of a study on the acquisition of two properties of Japanese, head-final word order and case marking, by naïve learners of Japanese as a L2 who had no prior knowledge of this language or any other head-final, case-marking language. Participants underwent an input treatment in which they heard and saw basic subject-object-verb sentences in Japanese and were subsequently tested on these basic sentences and also on sentences to which they were not exposed during the treatment (i.e., polar questions and embedded clauses). Reading times on grammatical and ungrammatical sentences served as measures of underlying sensitivity to violations of grammatical word order for both the basic sentences and the novel sentences. Our results yielded three groups of learners: those who showed sensitivity to violations of basic word order, polar questions, and embedded clauses (parameter reset); those who showed sensitivity to violations of basic word order and polar questions only (partial parameter reset); and those who showed sensitivity to violations of basic word order only (no parameter reset). Because our measure of aptitude as grammatical sensitivity did not emerge as a factor distinguishing the three groups from one another, we argue that this component of aptitude is not a factor in whether learners are able to reset parameters. We also found that all participants, regardless of group, demonstrated sensitivity to case-marking violations, suggesting that aptitude as grammatical sensitivity plays no role in the acquisition of underlying features related to case or to the surface-level markings of case in Japanese.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0272263114000345,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/aptitude-as-grammatical-sensitivity-initial/docview/1655478638/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Wen, Zhijun",2015,Chinese sentence processing by first and second language speakers,"This dissertation research investigates real-time second language (L2) sentence processing, with a focus on L2 Mandarin Chinese. It seeks to reveal how adult L2 learners (“L2ers”) exploit different sources of information (morphosyntactic, lexical-semantic, and discourse-context) and hence illuminates the issue of whether L2ers are capable of fully specified processing. The research employs two different processing tasks: comprehension-focused self-paced reading (CFSPR) and acceptability-judgment self-paced reading (AJSPR); there are four main studies: one in English comparing native English speakers with L1-Chinese L2ers of English, and three in Chinese comparing native Chinese speakers with learners of Chinese whose native language (L1) is English (or Japanese). The first study assesses whether AJSPR is more sensitive than CFSPR in detecting deep-level processing by examining L1 and L2 processing of English subject-verb number agreement in an AJSPR task in comparison to Wen’s (2007) study employing a CFSPR task. The second study compares L1 and L2 processing of (grammatical vs. ungrammatical) negation–aspect interactions in Chinese to test whether L2ers whose L1 lacks such morphosyntax can ultimately acquire it and use it in online sentence processing. The third study investigates use of lexical-semantic information in Chinese to test whether L2ers, in comparison to Chinese natives, over-depend on lexical-semantic information in sentence processing; this is achieved by comparing L1 and L2 participants’ sensitivity to temporary violations of the selectional restrictions of Chinese transitive verbs. The fourth study examines whether L2ers rely more on discourse-context information in processing Chinese sentences that contain null objects than Chinese natives do. The results of these studies reveal that (a) L2ers are able to access and use the different sources of information (morphosyntactic, lexical-semantic, discourse-context) in online sentence processing as L2 proficiency rises; (b) they do not always over-rely on lexical-semantic or contextual information in L2 sentence processing; (c) they are capable of fully specified processing. The research suggests that L2 processing difficulties are not necessarily indicative of deficient grammatical representations; rather, L2 sentence processing is subject to the influences of task demands, L2 proficiency, and L1 transfer. In addition, the research establishes AJSPR as an appropriate tool for gauging deep-level L2 processing.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/chinese-sentence-processing-first-second-language/docview/1780669454/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Schaefer, Vance",2015,Influence of the first and second language on the perception of Thai tones,"Convergent results from second language (L2) phonology literature suggest that when a phonetic or linguistic dimension is present or important in the first language (L1) of a learner, acquiring words that use this dimension in an L2 will be facilitated (Feature Hypothesis, McAllister, Flege &amp; Piske, 2002). This study applies this hypothesis to the dimension of linguistic pitch by testing speakers from L1s which utilize lexically-contrastive pitch in varying manners and degrees—Mandarin Chinese, (using pitch as tone), Japanese (using pitch accent), English (using pitch in word stress), and finally Korean (not using pitch to distinguish words)—on their perception of Thai tones. Additionally, an L1-English-speaking group who learned Mandarin as an L2 was tested on their perception of Thai tones to examine whether they can transfer their acquired perception of Mandarin tones to the naive perception of Thai tones. This L2 Mandarin Learner group has also been tested on a lexical decision task composed of Mandarin words and non-words to determine their acquisition of L2 Mandarin tone. Results show that lexically-contrastive pitch in the L1 does indeed influence the perception of a non-native lexically-contrastive pitch system, namely Thai tones. Furthermore, this influence differs in a hierarchical manner depending on the extent of the usage of lexically-contrastive pitch system. Second, results clearly demonstrate learning a tone language as an L2, i.e., Mandarin Chinese, by L1 speakers of English shapes the perception of a non-native tone language, i.e., Thai. Exposure to and accordingly encoding of Mandarin tones appear to be sufficiently robust to shape the naïve perception of Thai tones. L2 Mandarin learners outperform non-learners of Mandarin who also speak English as an L1 and perform at comparable levels to L1 speakers of Mandarin on the naïve perception of Thai tones. Furthermore, results show that learners are generally able to encode L2 tonal information in their lexical representations to the extent that lexical access is constrained.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/influence-first-second-language-on-perception/docview/1746683619/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Nagano, Marisa",2015,Interpretation of overt pronouns in L1 and L2 Japanese: The role of context,"This dissertation examines the interpretation of Japanese overt 3rd person pronouns by native (N=21) and advanced L1-English/L2-Japanese (N=20) speakers, using interpretation, reaction-time, and eye-tracking data. Previous studies have investigated L1 and L2 pronoun interpretation in null-subject languages like Spanish, Italian, and Greek, finding that L1 speakers tend to show a topic-shift effect for overt pronouns more often than L2ers (Sorace, 2011). Similar studies on Japanese, which allows null subjects but also differs greatly from these languages, have been mixed; crucially, several studies found no antecedent bias for overt pronouns by L1 speakers to begin with (Okuma, 2012; Ueno &amp; Kehler, 2010). This study first argues that Japanese overt 3rd person pronouns differ crucially from those in Italian-like languages, in that they do not elicit a generalized conversational implicature for topic-shift, nor do they fit on an anaphora hierarchy. Instead, Japanese 3rd person pronouns are better analyzed as triggering particularized conversational implicatures, i.e., that their interpretation must be calculated on an utterance-by-utterance basis based on the specific context of each utterance (as opposed to generalized conversational implicatures, which can be cancelled by context but are not created by it). This study further argues that advanced L2 speakers therefore face a different task than L2 speakers of Italian-like languages, and crucially must inhibit English in order to achieve a native-like interpretation pattern.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interpretation-overt-pronouns-l1-l2-japanese-role/docview/1725773750/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Ahn, Hyunjung",2015,Second Language Acquisition of Korean Case by Learners with Different First Languages,"This dissertation examines the role of L2 learners’ first language (L1) in acquiring a target morpho-syntactic feature (case) and learner perceptions of the L2 grammar, specifically, Korean case and case particles. In addition to investigating what and how much is transferred from the L1, the study also looks to see if learners’ perceptions match their actual production. In order to answer these research questions, two quantitative and one qualitative study were used. The initial quantitative study was conducted using an expanded grammaticality judgment task completed by 25 English L1 learners of Korean, with 15 Korean L1 controls. The Key findings from that studied suggest that English L1 learners of Korean acquired nominative case earlier than the accusative case, patterning with Korean L1 acquisition. Also, learners accurately identified the incorrect usage of nominative particles 60% of the time, but only 51% for accusative particles. Building on the findings of that study, speaking and written production tasks were completed by 70 L2 Korean learners, who were divided into nearly equally-sized groups for three different L1s (22 Chinese, 27 English and 21 Japanese). An assumption of the degree of L1 transfer to L2 Korean was made specifically for case, which was that Chinese transferred less than English and English less than Japanese. It was hypothesized that deep transfer —that being the transfer of syntax from the L1—and surface transfer, which is a transfer of morphology, could be investigated (Sabourin et al 2006). The results highlight that learners, regardless of their L1, used more correct case particles in writing than in speaking. The Japanese L1 group had the highest proficiency for case particles, with Chinese being the least proficient. The data confirmed that morphology was transferred ‘over syntax’ from the L1 and the surface transfer of morphology seems to play an important role (Montrul 1997, 1999, 2000; Sabourin et al 2006). Finally, to support and clarify the two quantitative studies a series, of qualitative interviews were conducted with 57 participants, and 9 key informants participated in multiple interviews. L2 learners were aware that their linguistic backgrounds affect feature transferability and the learnability of the target language. Already knowing perceived similar language was seen as beneficial. Kellerman’s Psychotypology (1983) was used to highlights learners’ perceptual language distance between their L1 and L2. In this study, Chinese learners still considered Korean relatively close to their L1, largely due to cultural associations and vocabulary, and that Korean was not difficult to acquire. Learner’s perceptions of ease were not supported by the actual production data. Different motivations also did not seem to be a main factor of the acquisition of case. Therefore, with the findings, it is argued that the role of L1 in terms of the same morphosyntaictic features in both L1 and L2 is tremendous, and that psychotypology and motivation seem to be overridden by the features.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-korean-case-learners/docview/1722049012/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Albin, Aaron Lee",2015,Typologizing native language influence on intonation in a second language: Three transfer phenomena in Japanese EFL learners,"While a substantial body of research has accumulated regarding how intonation is acquired in a second language (L2), the topic has historically received relatively little attention from mainstream models of L2 phonology. As such, a unified theoretical framework suited to address unique acquisitional challenges specific to this domain of L2 knowledge (such as form-function mapping) has been lacking. The theoretical component of the dissertation makes progress on this front by taking up the issue of crosslinguistic transfer in L2 intonation. Using Mennen's (2015) L2 Intonation Learning theory as a point of departure, the available empirical studies are synthesized into a typology of the different possible ways two languages' intonation systems can mismatch as well as the concomitant implications for transfer. Next, the methodological component of the dissertation presents a framework for overcoming challenges in the analysis of L2 learners' intonation production due to the interlanguage mixing of their native and L2 systems. The proposed method involves first creating a stylization of the learner's intonation contour and then running queries to extract phonologically-relevant features of interest for a particular research question. A novel approach to stylization is also introduced that not only allows for transitions between adjacent pitch targets to have a nonlinear shape but also explicitly parametrizes and stores this nonlinearity for analysis. Finally, these two strands are integrated in a third, empirical component to the dissertation. Three kinds of intonation transfer, representing nodes from different branches of the typology, are examined in Japanese learners of English as a Foreign Language (EFL). For each kind of transfer, fourteen sentences were selected from a large L2 speech corpus (English Speech Database Read by Japanese Students), and productions of each sentence by approximately 20-30 learners were analyzed using the proposed method. Results suggest that the three examined kinds of transfer are stratified into a hierarchy of relative frequency, with some phenomena occurring much more pervasively than others. Together as a whole, the present dissertation lays the groundwork for future research on L2 intonation by not only generating empirical predictions to be tested but also providing the analytical tools for doing so.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/typologizing-native-language-influence-on/docview/1710812538/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Marijuan, Silvia Susana",2015,"EL(LA) mapping: An integrated account of learning context, feedback and agreement morphology in the processing of O<sub>cl</sub>VS sentences in advanced L2 Spanish","Previous literature has shown that beginning and intermediate English-speaking learners persistently misinterpret O-cliticVS sentences in Spanish, preferring word order over morphology when assigning semantic functions to the NPs of non-canonical sentences. Following the Competition Model (Bates &amp; MacWhinney, 1982, 1989; MacWhinney, 2012), this dissertation investigated from an on-line and off-line account whether English-speaking advanced learners of Spanish are also prone to such misinterpretations, and whether their reconfiguration of L1 processing strategies benefits from: (a) mismatches in number agreement morphology, (b) immersion experience, and (c) computer-delivered feedback. Three self-paced readings were conducted. In Experiment 1 (N=38), matching/mismatching number agreement between clitic and verb was manipulated to measure the usefulness of contrastive agreement to overcome word order bias. Experiment 2 (N=20) investigated whether a 5-week Study Abroad program promoted learners’ O cl VS sentence development. Experiment 3 (N=90) investigated potential interactions between agreement conditions and the provision or absence of computer-delivered feedback. Results showed that advanced learners continued to rely on word order when interpreting O cl VS sentences, but different agreement conditions were not processed alike. In Experiment 1, accuracy significantly improved in the mismatching condition in which the morphological cue was on the verb. Participants also tended to present longer reading times in the verb of Cl sg V pl S pl structures. In Experiment 2, learners significantly improved at Week 5 and paid more attention to the verb and post-verbal subject, which are highly informative. In Experiment 3, the [+ Feedback] group outperformed the [- Feedback] group, which only received practice decoding manipulated input. Also, the [+ Feedback] group exhibited a speedup across experimental trials in the baseline condition (Cl sg V sg S sg ) whereas the [- Feedback] group exhibited a significant slowdown in the mismatching Cl sg V pl S pl condition. This dissertation has implications for research on intra-subject L2 processing variation and emerging bilingualism. It also contributes to the debate on whether short-term studies overseas influence L2 grammar skills. Finally, the extent to which exposure to manipulated input alone helps learners reconfigure their L2 processing strategies is discussed along with feedback’s potential role in enhancing this process.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/el-la-mapping-integrated-account-learning-context/docview/1707670431/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Bedinghaus, Robert William",2015,The effect of exposure to phonological variation on perceptual categorization and lexical access in second language Spanish: The case of /s/-aspiration in Western Andalusian Spanish,"This dissertation investigates the acquisition of a dialect-specific phonological variant by American English-speaking L2 learners of Spanish who study abroad for one semester in the target dialect region compared to L2 learners who remain at their home university in the traditional language classroom context (‘At-home’ learners) without exposure to the target variant. The perception of aspirated-/s/ in Western Andalusian Spanish, which is unique in its phonetic articulation and is subject to social and stylistic variation, is examined. In this investigation, 33 native speakers of Spanish from Seville, Spain, 10 native speakers of Spanish from regions in which /s/ is not aspirated, 48 L2 learners of Spanish in the study abroad context, and 25 learners of Spanish in the traditional classroom context completed a forced-choice identification task, a lexical decision task, background questionnaires, a grammar test, and a word familiarity questionnaire. Analysis of the patterns of identification and lexical decision related to /s/-aspiration revealed: (1) effects of condition (i.e., the aspirated condition was significantly more difficult for L2 learners than other control conditions), (2) effects of exposure to /s/-aspiration for the L2 groups on the accuracy of identification and lexical decision (i.e., study abroad groups made gains while the at-home group did not), (3) effects of exposure to /s/-aspiration on lexical decision response time (i.e., study abroad learners responded faster to /s/-aspiration over time while at-home learners did not), (4) and some effects of the amount and types of target language use by the L2 learners abroad for the identification task. However, extralinguistic factors such as contact with native speakers and target language use during the semester abroad did not show consistent effects across tasks, which is argued to be a methodological issue. Implications for the study of the effects of extralinguistic factors on linguistic gains during study abroad are discussed. Differences were also found between the two native speaker groups, primarily for the /s/-aspiration condition, indicating dialectal differences in L1 speech perception. This dissertation shows that immersion during study abroad leads to perceptual gains related to a dialect-specific phonological variant, but that traditional research methods for investigating individual differences among study abroad learners must be revised.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-exposure-phonological-variation-on/docview/1706912679/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Goss, Seth Joshua",2015,The Effects of Internal and Experience-Based Factors on the Perception of Lexical Pitch Accent by Native and Nonnative Japanese Listeners,"This dissertation explores the influence of both learner-internal cognitive resources and experience-based factors on the perception of Japanese lexical accent. In Japanese, individual words carry a pitch pattern as part of their phonological form, and these accent patterns form a basic prosodic unit of the language. Cross-linguistic speech perception research has focused by and large on phonetic comparisons of a learner's native language (L1) with that of the second language (L2). Yet, a large degree of individual variation in L2 Japanese accent perception ability remains unaccounted for, suggesting that some learners—despite speaking the same L1 and possessing similar learning experiences—are better at attuning to new sound categories than others. Couple this with previous findings indicating that accent perception does not develop in parallel with Japanese proficiency level, and that immersion in the target-language environment seems to provide little advantage, and the need for a listener-focused investigation becomes apparent. The present research thus attempted to clarify this reported variation by looking at a range of learner-variables potentially involved in prosodic perception. Three experiments investigated native and nonnative Japanese listeners' accent perception ability on correctness-judgment and categorization tasks. Experiment 1 looked at L1 Japanese listeners. Experiment 2 focused on advanced learners of Japanese from two language backgrounds, L1 Chinese and L1 Korean speakers. Experiment 3 measured the development of accent perception over a semester of study in L1 English beginning learners of Japanese in two learning contexts, at-home and study-abroad. In all experiments, participants' phonological short-term memory capacity and acoustic pitch sensitivity were measured as learner-internal predictors of accent perception ability. Experience-based factors included L1 background, Japanese lexicon size and learning context. Multiple regression analyses were then used to determine the relative contribution of each of these factors on listeners' perception of lexical pitch accent. The results revealed that for L1 Japanese speakers, who were very accurate at the correctness-judgment task, acoustic sensitivity predicted perception accuracy. Despite possessing robust knowledge of the phonological properties of their L1, this finding suggests that a basic cognitive resource is still active in L1 accent perception. With the advanced learners, two factors were significantly related to their ability to perceive accent—L1 background and L2 lexicon size. On the other hand, for beginning learners, who were still actively acquiring Japanese, the two basic cognitive resources predicted which individuals made the largest gains in perceptual ability over a semester of study. Thus, for L2 Japanese learners, I posit an acoustic-to-lexical continuum for accent acquisition, whereby beginners are reliant on memory and basic acoustic sensitivity to support their listening performance. However, as I observed with the advanced group, learners increasingly rely on their long-term knowledge of L2 word form in perceiving lexical accent. The pedagogical application of these results is discussed in terms of the increased use of form-focused correction of accent and visual supplements in the language classroom to aid lower-capacity learners' perceptual development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-internal-experience-based-factors-on/docview/1700837468/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Lee, Eunji",2015,L2 acquisition of number marking: A bidirectional study of adult learners of Korean and Indonesian,"This study investigates the L2 acquisition of the Korean and Indonesian number systems by adult learners in light of the Feature-Reassembly Approach (henceforth FRA, Lardiere 2009). In considering this approach, Montrul and Yoon (2009) further suggest that subtracting or unlearning existing L1 features may pose greater difficulty than the addition of new L2 features, while Hwang &amp; Lardiere (2013) propose that features more deeply embedded in a feature co-occurrence hierarchy, such as the [±human] feature, will be developmentally acquired later. This dissertation presents the findings of two experiments examining the restrictions on quantifiers with classifiers and/or plural marking by L1 Indonesian-speaking learners of L2 Korean (Study1) and L1 Korean-speaking learners of L2 Indonesian (Study 2). Seventy learners at three L2 Korean proficiency levels along with 40 native controls participated in Study 1, and 61 learners at three L2 Indonesian proficiency levels along with 39 native controls participated in Study 2. The participants of both experiments completed three tasks—a Sentence Completion Task, a Grammaticality Judgment Task and a Multiple-choice Task—designed to probe knowledge of features and restrictions associated with Korean or Indonesian number marking. The results of Study 1 showed that, although there was improvement in L2 Korean learners' performance with increasing proficiency, the advanced learners had still not acquired all the co-occurrence restrictions of the L2 Korean number system; specifically, L2 Korean learners, regardless of proficiency level, showed difficulty in acquiring the more deeply-embedded [human] feature associated with Korean plural marking. On the other hand, the results of Study 2 indicated that while low-proficiency L2 Indonesian learners initially showed some difficulty in subtracting L1-Korean-based features in L2 Indonesian plural marking, the advanced learners successfully acquired the restrictions and required feature matrices of number marking in the target language. The current study suggests that the particular L1-L2 pairing will certainly impact what kind of feature restructuring is required in order to acquire new feature matrices of lexical items in a second language, which will in turn affect the developmental process of acquisition, thus lending additional overall support to the FRA.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-acquisition-number-marking-bidirectional-study/docview/1678621227/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Preston, Laurel B.",2015,Generativism and Emergentism: Evidence from Second Language Acquisition Studies of Poverty of the Stimulus Phenomena,"This work applies evidence from second language acquisition studies to the question of the existence of an inborn, language-specific system that constrains the set of possible human grammars. Three sets of studies are examined and critiqued. The sets were selected so that the studies within each of the sets are comparable on the basis of the target phenomenon investigated and the experimental techniques, but contrast on the basis of their chosen theoretical frameworks. The target phenomena are the Overt Pronoun Constraint, scrambling, and quantifier scope ambiguities. Each set of studies includes at least one study conducted within the generativist approach, advocating for L2 learner access to an innate language-specific endowment (often called Universal Grammar) that is essential to the acquisition of grammar in the presence of impoverished linguistic input. Also, each set of studies contains at least one study conducted within an emergentist approach, advocating that domain-general learning mechanisms applied to rich and complex linguistic input suffice to explain L2 learner attainment. All of the target phenomena investigated in these studies are constructions that have been argued in the generative literature to pose poverty-of-the-stimulus (POS) problems for L2 learners. That is, the linguistic input typically available to learners in the form of second language input, instruction, and through their first language, has been argued to underdetermine the acquisition of the construction. The poverty of the stimulus is considered a cornerstone argument for the existence of UG. Based on my review and critique of the selected studies, I find that their aggregate empirical results support the generativist approach. However, I do not rest this claim on a POS argument; I argue that the premise of insufficiency of input has not been well enough established for the POS argument to be applied. Instead, I argue that the evidence from these studies is more consistent with generative predictions for sudden, step-wise acquisition of grammatical contrasts, possibly on the basis of limited input, rather than with emergentist predictions for gradual, incremental acquisition on a necessarily substantial amount of input.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/generativism-emergentism-evidence-second-language/docview/1675023831/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Mozgalina, Anastasia",2015,Applying an argument-based approach for validating language proficiency assessments in second language acquisition research: The elicited imitation test for Russian,"This dissertation was motivated by the need for practical suggestions as to what can be done to improve L2 proficiency assessment practices in SLA research. In response, it is proposed that an argument-based approach to validity (Kane, 2006) can be applied to improve SLA test validation practices. To exemplify this approach, a new assessment was developed and interpretive arguments associated with its distinct uses were crafted. The associated inferential claims were then tested empirically. The two intended uses for the new Russian Elicited Imitation Test (EIT) were: controlling participants' initial levels of Russian oracy (study 1) and selecting participants into a study based on their holistic level of speaking and listening proficiency (study 2). To evaluate the accuracy of the score interpretation for the first use, the EIT was administered to 97 Russian learners in Germany and the USA along with a background questionnaire. To evaluate the accuracy of the score interpretation for the second use, the EIT was administered to 67 Russian learners in the US along with the Russian Speaking Test, a listening comprehension test, and a C-test. Multiple descriptive, graphical, and inferential statistical techniques were employed in the data analysis. Of particular utility in study 1 use were descriptive statistics, item response theory analysis, differential item functioning analysis, inter-rater reliability analysis, and correlational analysis. Key to understanding the effectiveness of the EIT for predicting learners' speaking and listening proficiency in study 2 were descriptive statistics, correlational analysis, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, and 95% confidence intervals. The Russian EIT was found to constitute a reliable instrument that functions well with Russian learners in the US and Germany. It showed the ability to differentiate between a wide range of oracy skills, and proposed cut scores were identified to enable the prediction of four distinct levels of the speaking proficiency and to predict a threshold of intermediate listening skills. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for using the argument-based approach for validating assessments in SLA research, and for the use of and future needed research on the Russian EIT and EITs in general.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/applying-argument-based-approach-validating/docview/1673878188/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Brandl, Anel",2013,Processing strategies by beginning L2 learners of English and Spanish: A crosslinguistic study,"A central issue in second language acquisition (SLA) research is the relationship between morphosyntactic and lexical-semantic knowledge among L2 learners. It has been proposed that, L2 language acquisition starts with transfer of L1 semantic and morphosyntactic processing strategies; however, it has been observed that, at lower proficiency levels, the language processor may not have sufficient resources to transfer and use L1 morphosyntactic cues such as agreement morphology, case markers, etc. to process the L2. Therefore, this dissertation investigates whether L2 learners default to more local and lexical-semantic parsing (i.e. universal parsing) at the beginning stages of second language acquisition. This dissertation examines the processing strategies of two groups of L2 learners (L1 English – L2 Spanish and L1 Spanish – L2 English) on two experimental tasks: a self-paced listening task and a sentence interpretation task. The results suggest that L1 transfer does not occur at the beginning stages of acquisition; that is, the beginning L2 learners in this study were not able to process agreement cues; thus, they did not demonstrated the ability to integrate grammatical information encoded in verbal morphology in real time processing. Instead, the results indicated that L2 learners, regardless of L1, defaulted to local and lexical-semantic strategies (e.g., first-noun strategy) to process the L2 at the beginning stages of acquisition. These results lend support to the First Noun Principle (VanPatten 2007) and are discussed in term of the representational and processing problem of L2 acquisition. Implications for models of L2 sentence processing (Input Processing and the Competition Model) are also presented in this dissertation.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-strategies-beginning-l2-learners/docview/1410774205/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Bishop, Jason Brandon",2013,"Prenuclear Accentuation in English: Phonetics, Phonology, Information Structure","A primary function of prosody in many languages is to convey information structure—the ""packaging"" of a sentence's content into categories such as ""focus"", ""given"" and ""topic"". In English and other West Germanic languages it is widely assumed that focus is signaled prosodically by the location of a nuclear pitch accent. As a result, prenuclear, or ""secondary"" accents are standardly regarded as optional, phonological objects that are unrelated to the information structural representation. This dissertation investigates, from the perspective of the listener, how valid this claim about prenuclear accents is. As a case study, I consider a putative prosodic ambiguity: the size of the focus constituent in English SVO constructions (i.e., ""broad focus"" on a VP versus ""narrow focus"" on an object). My approach to this issue is essentially a three-pronged one, considering the production, perception and processing of prenuclear accents in relation to this contrast. Recent phonetic evidence from production studies is the starting point for a set of perception experiments (Chapter 2) and a pair of cross-modal priming experiments (Chapter 3). Both sets of experiments provide evidence that listeners have expectations about focus-prenuclear accent correspondences that mirror patterns reported in speakers' productions, suggesting that the broad versus narrow focus contrast is not a genuine prosodic ambiguity. An additional matter that is investigated is the extent to which individual differences in ""cognitive processing styles"" (autistic traits and verbal working memory) contribute to variation among listeners. To account for the experimental findings, I argue that the prosodic realization of the size of the focus constituent in English SVOs represents conventionalized, phonological behavior. The variation, it is shown, can be captured by an Autosegmental Metrical model of prosodic structure that includes syntagmatic relations of tonal prominence along the lines proposed by Ladd (1990). This level of ""tonal metrical structure"" represents linguistically-specified pitch range, and it is demonstrated that such structure is independently needed to account for the prosodic realization of several other information structural contrasts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/prenuclear-accentuation-english-phonetics/docview/1400821076/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Lovitt, Ashli",2013,The Linguistic Gains and Acculturation of American High School Students on Exchange Programs in Germany,"There has been a sharp rise in study abroad participation over the last few decades (Institute for International Education, 2011), which can largely be explained by the rise of short-term study abroad programs. While there is much to be gained from participation in such programs, mid-length and year programs may offer the greatest benefits for linguistic gain (e.g. Brecht, Davidson &amp; Ginsberg, 1996; Freed, 1995; Lafford, 2004; Vande Berg, 2003). Despite the advantages of longer stays, the percentage of students studying abroad for an entire year ""has remained steady for over a decade"" (Institute for International Education, 2011). Roughly four-percent of all students who study abroad choose to do so for an academic or calendar year. This statistic points to a problem with attracting students to pursue longer stays abroad. The Open Doors Report , prepared by the Institute for International Education, assumes a narrow view of study abroad by excluding data on American high school students. The present study attempts to fill a gap in the research by examining the overseas experiences of 14 American high school and gap year students who studied abroad in Germany during the academic year of 2011-2012. Data for this study was collected in the form of questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, the WebCAPE German placement test developed at Brigham Young University, and unofficial Oral Proficiency Interviews. The findings of the current study may help inform those involved in study abroad at both the high school and university levels. The purposes of this mixed-methods research, which is organized into three articles, are the following: 1) to investigate students' use of technology in a study abroad context, and examine how online communication might be indicative of participation in multiple Activity Systems (e.g. Engeström, 2011; Lantolf &amp; Thorne, 2006; Leontiev, 2006), 2) to describe students' degree of participation in new Communities of Practice at German schools (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998; 2000) and, 3) to investigate students' (re)construction of national and regional identities. The role that language proficiency and prior instruction in the target language might play in the study abroad context is explored across all three topics.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/linguistic-gains-acculturation-american-high/docview/1364612101/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Ozeki, Hiromi;Shirai, Yasuhiro",2007,DOES THE NOUN PHRASE ACCESSIBILITY HIERARCHY PREDICT THE DIFFICULTY ORDER IN THE ACQUISITION OF JAPANESE RELATIVE CLAUSES?,"Although Keenan and Comrie's (1977) noun phrase accessibility hierarchy (NPAH) has been shown to predict the difficulty order of relative clauses (RCs) in SLA, most studies of the NPAH have been on European languages. This paper tests the prediction for Japanese. Study 1 analyzes RCs in an oral interview corpus from 90 learners of Japanese at four different levels of proficiency (first language = Mandarin Chinese, English, and Korean; N = 30 for each). Analysis of 1005 RCs from nonnative data and 231 RCs from 15 native speakers (NSs) of Japanese revealed that even lower proficiency learners used direct object (DO) and oblique (OBL) relatives, suggesting that subject (SU) relatives are not easier than DO or OBL relatives for second language learners of Japanese. The learners (except Korean NSs) also made strong associations between SU and animate heads and between DO/OBL and inanimate heads. Study 2 employed a sentence-combining experiment. Fifty NSs of Cantonese studying Japanese in Hong Kong took the test, which controlled for the animacy of head noun phrases and arguments of the verbs. Results revealed no significant difference between SU and DO, which were both easier than OBL, with only a minimal effect of animacy. However, errors of converting DO and OBL target items into SU relatives almost exclusively involved animate-head items. The results suggest that the NPAH does not predict the difficulty order of Japanese RCs, and that learners use different types of RCs based on the animacy of the head noun.

"Jeon, K Seon;Kim, Hae-young",2007,DEVELOPMENT OF RELATIVIZATION IN KOREAN AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE: The Noun Phrase Accessibility Hierarchy in Head-Internal and Head-External Relative Clauses,"This study examines how Keenan and Comrie's (1977) noun phrase accessibility hierarchy (NPAH) intersects with the typological characteristics of Korean in the acquisition of relative clauses (RCs). Korean has two types of RC constructions: head-external and head-internal. The head-external relative has its head to the right of the RC, whereas the head-internal relative has its lexical head in the RC and is marked by the complementizer kes. In first language development, it has been observed the head-internal type emerges earlier than the head-external type. The current study investigates how the use of the two types of RCs interacts with the NPAH, with a focus on subject (SU) and direct object (DO) RCs in Korean second language development. Oral production data were collected from 40 learners of Korean as a foreign language. The results showed that there was an advantage for SU over DO in the head-external RC and that the head-external construction was preceded by headless and head-internal constructions. The results suggest that a head-external RC in Korean involves the syntactic mechanism of linking the head and the gap relation, whereas this might not be the case for a head-internal RC.

"Yabuki-soh, Noriko",2007,TEACHING RELATIVE CLAUSES IN JAPANESE: Exploring Alternative Types of Instruction and the Projection Effect,"This quasi-experimental study explores the effects of three types of instruction (form-based, meaning-based, and form- plus meaning-based) on the learning of Japanese relative clauses (RCs) and postsecondary Japanese as a foreign language learners' ability to generalize different types of relativization, examined in comparison to the predictions of Keenan and Comrie's (1977) noun phrase accessibility hierarchy (NPAH). The study investigated whether instruction focused on a marked relativization type could facilitate the learning of other types. Results of comprehension and sentence-combination pretests and posttests showed that although the scores of all three groups increased, the form-based group outperformed the other two groups on both tests. Whereas the comprehension pretest results did not reflect the predictions of the NPAH, participants were able to generalize rules for other relativization types. This study suggests that learners' attention to detailed analysis of form facilitates the learning of RCs in this context, and that the teaching of marked items might inform effective syllabus development in second language relativization.

"Kanno, Kazue",2007,FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROCESSING OF JAPANESE RELATIVE CLAUSES BY L2 LEARNERS,"This article reports on a crosslinguistic comparative study of the processing of Japanese relative clauses (RCs) by Chinese-, Sinhalese-, Vietnamese-, Thai-, and Indonesian-speaking second language (L2) learners. A robust finding in studies on the acquisition of RCs in L2 English and other European languages is that subject-gap RCs are easier than object-gap RCs, both in production and comprehension. However, in the case of L2 Japanese studies, the picture does not seem to be as clear as in the English case. This study identifies some factors that might contribute to this situation. The results of a listening comprehension test involving reversible and nonreversible test sentences show that the five groups of learners overall found subject-gap RCs easier to process than object-gap RCs, but that their performances are poor and vary for sentence types in which no semantic cue is available to help identify the grammatical function of the overt noun phrase in RCs, yielding inconclusive results with respect to the question of whether subject-gap RCs are easier than object-gap RCs. Results indicate that when RCs are too difficult for learners to process, first language properties such as head direction, word order, and the relative order of filler and gap affect the manner in which they are interpreted.

"Shirai, Yasuhiro;Ozeki, Hiromi",2007,INTRODUCTION,"Typological linguistics has made important contributions to our understanding of SLA processes, especially in the early days of SLA research (e.g., Eckman, 1977; Hyltenstam, 1977; Rutherford, 1984). In particular, the noun phrase accessibility hierarchy (NPAH), originally proposed as a generalization based on typological work by Keenan and Comrie (1977), has served as a basis on which many SLA studies are conducted. The NPAH predicts the ease of relativization as a function of the grammatical role of the head noun phrase (NP) modified by the relative clause (RC) observed in languages of the world: subject (SU) &gt; direct object (DO) &gt; indirect object (IO) &gt; oblique (OBL) &gt; genitive (GEN) &gt; object of comparison (OComp). If a language can relativize on a position on the hierarchy, then it follows that any other higher position (or position to the left in the given schematic) can also be relativized on. For example, if a language has an OComp relative (e.g., the man who I am taller than), then it has a GEN relative (e.g., the man whose father I know) and all of the others higher on the hierarchy (i.e., OBL, IO, DO, and SU).

"Sugaya, Natsue;Shirai, Yasuhiro",2007,"THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRESSIVE AND RESULTATIVE MEANINGS OF THE IMPERFECTIVE ASPECT MARKER BY L2 LEARNERS OF JAPANESE: Transfer, Universals, or Multiple Factors?","It has been observed that there is a strong association between the inherent (lexical) aspect of verbs and the acquisition of tense-aspect morphology (the aspect hypothesis; Andersen &amp; Shirai, 1994). To investigate why such an association is observed, this study examined the influence of inherent aspect and learners' first language (L1) on the acquisition of Japanese imperfective aspect by using two tasks--an acceptability judgment test and an oral picture description task--with two groups of second language learners of Japanese: 26 native speakers (NSs) of English, which has the obligatory progressive, and 35 NSs of languages that have no obligatory progressive marking (German and Slavic languages). The results from the acceptability judgment test support the aspect hypothesis in that, regardless of L1, the imperfective marker -te i-ru was strongly associated with activity verbs for lower proficiency learners. However, the results from the oral task did not support the prediction, in that lower proficiency L1 nonprogressive learners did not show any such preference. The results suggest that L1 plays a role in the formation of the acquisition pattern predicted by the aspect hypothesis, but that given the complex interaction with task types and proficiency, L1 transfer cannot be the sole reason for the predicted association in the acquisition of Japanese -te i-(ru). It is argued that multiple factors are at work when learners create the form-meaning associations predicted by the aspect hypothesis.

"Belz, Julie A",2007,THE ROLE OF COMPUTER MEDIATION IN THE INSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF L2 PRAGMATIC COMPETENCE,"This article provides a selective review of the role of computer mediation in the instruction and development of second language (L2) or interlanguage pragmatic competence within foreign and second language education. Both researchers and practitioners have noted consistently that several aspects of the teaching and tutored learning of L2 pragmatics have been reported as problematic and/or underexplored in the published knowledge base to date, including the availability and authenticity of instructional materials, the provision of opportunities for the performance and practice of L2 pragmatic competence in meaningful interactions, the relative lack of developmental data documenting the precise (and varied) pathways of L2 pragmatic competence over time, and the efficacy of particular pedagogical interventions in classroom-based L2 pragmatics instruction. The role of computer mediation in each of these underexplored areas is examined with a special emphasis on the teaching and learning of L2 pragmatics in Internet-mediated partnerships and on the use of (learner) corpora in L2 pragmatics instruction and research.

"Kim, Hana",2007,The interpretation of English pronouns by native speakers of Korean,"This thesis investigated how Korean L2 speakers of English, whose L1 is a null argument language, interpret English pronouns, and how (or if) their L1 plays a role in the interpretation of English pronouns. Specifically, it examined whether Korean speakers of English have knowledge of Binding Principle B in the interpretation of English pronouns, and also whether they transfer their preferences for a discourse antecedent versus a matrix subject (sentence internal) antecedent from their L1 to English. As a pretest, the participants' knowledge in relation to subject and object omission in English was examined. The results showed that the Korean speakers of English, regardless of whether or not they knew that English is not a null argument language, knew that an English pronoun cannot be locally bound in its governing category. That is, the results indicated that their interpretation of pronouns in their English L2 was constrained by Binding Principle B. Furthermore, the results showed that they preferred a matrix subject antecedent to a discourse antecedent, similar to the native speakers of English. However, at the same time, they were more inclined to accept a discourse antecedent than were the native speakers of English. The results suggested that the Korean speakers of English were influenced to a certain extent by their L1 in their interpretation of English pronouns, while their L1 Korean did not cause problems to figure out non-local constraints for an English pronoun.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interpretation-english-pronouns-native-speakers/docview/304828760/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Mori, Junko;Hayashi, Makoto",2006,The Achievement of Intersubjectivity through Embodied Completions: A Study of Interactions Between First and Second Language Speakers,"This study examines casual interactions between first language (L1) and second language (L2) speakers of Japanese, paying special attention to the coordination of vocal and non-vocal resources that are brought to bear on the achievement of intersubjectivity. More specifically, this study investigates a practice of 'embodied completion' (Olsher 2004), namely the practice of deploying a partial turn of talk that offers a projectable trajectory of ongoing action and completing that action with a gesture or other embodied display. The participants' conduct that precedes this embodied completion reveals the local processes used to evaluate, discover, and establish shared linguistic and non-linguistic resources in pursuing intersubjectivity. Further, the sequence of actions that follows the embodied completion provides an incidental, interactionally motivated opportunity for the L1 speaker to reformulate what the L2 speaker has said with a more sophisticated linguistic expression. Through the close analysis of two focal cases of embodied completion, which underscores the conversation analytic (CA) perspective of 'competences as resources,' this study explores the kinds of contributions that can be made by using CA's explication of interactional details towards the understanding of language learning as it occurs in socially situated practices.", Journal Article,,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/achievement-intersubjectivity-through-embodied/docview/203922294/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Gullberg, Marianne",2006,Some reasons for studying gesture and second language acquisition (Hommage à Adam Kendon)*,"[...]because of the close link between gestures, language, and speech, learners' gestures as deployed in L2 usage and interaction can offer valuable insights into the processes of acquisition, such as the handling of expressive difficulties, the influence of the first language, interlanguage phenomena, and possibly even into planning and processing difficulties. [...]gestures can be seen as input, raising a range of questions regarding their role in the classroom, and their effects on comprehension and learning more generally. The command of the gestural repertoire of a language is important to the individual learners' communicative efficiency and ""cultural fluency"" (Poyatos 1983) - perhaps less in terms of misunderstandings (Schneller 1988) than in terms of the general integration in the target culture. [...]to SLA research the acquisition of gestures holds theoretical interest in that it suggests a different and much expanded view of what it means to be native- or target-like. [...]we are only beginning to discover ways in which gestures can function as a window into learners' minds and into processes of acquisition.", General Information,10.1515/IRAL.2006.004,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/some-reasons-studying-gesture-second-language/docview/205001612/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Lozano, Cristobal",2006,Focus and split-intransitivity: the acquisition of word order alternations in non-native Spanish,"Recent unrelated studies reveal what appears to be a common acquisitional pattern in second language acquisition (SLA). While some findings show that advanced learners can indeed achieve convergent, native-like competence with formal syntactic properties (even when these are underdetermined by the input), other findings suggest that they can display divergent and even optional competence at the syntax-discourse interface with discursive properties like focus and topic. These apparently contradictory observations are not coincidental, as they can also be traced in other acquisitional studies on L1 acquisition, L1 attrition in bilinguals, child SLA and SLI (specific language impairment). If this pattern is correct, it should be observed in the L2 acquisition of any given property that is simultaneously governed by both a formal grammatical constraint and a discursive constraint. I tested whether this is the case in advanced non-native Spanish acquisition of the syntactic distribution of subject-verb (SV) and verb-subject (VS) word order, which is constrained by both a formal syntactic property (the Unaccusative Hypothesis or Split-intransitivity Hypothesis) and a property at the syntax-discourse interface (presentational focus). Results show that the interlanguage grammars (ILGs) of both English ( n = 17) and Greek (n = 18) learners of Spanish converge with the grammars of native Spanish speakers (n = 14) when formal properties are involved, yet they diverge (in particular by showing optionality) with discursive focus. These results confirm the emerging view that acquisition of formal syntactic properties is more readily acquired than discourse properties, which are persistently problematic.", Journal Article,10.1191/0267658306sr264oa,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/focus-split-intransitivity-acquisition-word-order/docview/200213293/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Acoustic analyses and listener judgments were used to determine how accurately the suprasegmentals were produced and to what extent they contributed to foreign accent. Results revealed that amount of experience influenced the production of one suprasegmental (stress timing), whereas adult learners' age at the time of first extensive exposure to the L2 (indexed as age of arrival in the United States) influenced the production of others (speech rate, pause frequency, pause duration). Moreover, it was found that suprasegmentals contributed to foreign accent at all levels of experience and that some suprasegmentals (pause duration, speech rate) were more likely to do so than others (stress timing, peak alignment). Overall, results revealed similarities between L2 segmental and suprasegmental learning.

"Lantolf, James P",2006,SOCIOCULTURAL THEORY AND L2: State of the Art,"This article considers the implications of two central constructs of sociocultural theory (SCT) for second language (L2) development: mediation and internalization. It first discusses Vygotsky's general theoretical claim that human mental activity arises as a consequence of the functional system formed by our biologically specified mental capacities and our culturally constructed symbolic artifacts. It then examines some of the L2 research that has investigated the extent to which L2 users are able to deploy their new language for cognitive mediation. Specific attention is given to the mediational function of L2 private speech and to the synchronization of gestures and speech from the perspective of Slobin's thinking for speaking framework, a framework that interfaces quite well with Vygotsky's theory. The second general topic addressed, internalization, is intimately connected to the first. It is argued that internalization of the features of a L2 takes place through imitation, especially as occurs in private speech. Imitation, based on recent neuroscience and child development research, is seen as an intentional and potentially transformative process rather than as rote mimicking. The research documents that L2 children and adults rely on imitation in their private speech when they encounter new linguistic affordances. What remains to be established is the connection between the linguistic features of private speech and those deployed by L2 speakers in their social performance. Finally, the article proposes that the study of how L2 learners internalize and develop the capacity to use conceptual and associated linguistic knowledge should move to the forefront of SCT L2 research and argues that a productive way of realizing this agenda is through the union of SCT and cognitive linguistics.

Specifically, it will be shown that language expertise was made relevant (a) when one participant invited the other party's repair and (b) when the participants encountered a problem in achieving mutual understanding. On such occasions, the interlocutors oriented to the differences in their linguistic knowledge through their talk and other interactional conduct.

"Pickering, Lucy",2006,CURRENT RESEARCH ON INTELLIGIBILITY IN ENGLISH AS A LINGUA FRANCA,"Recognition of incipient change in the status of English as an international language has yielded a small but growing area of research addressing nonnative speaker to nonnative speaker (NNS-NNS) interaction. Issues concerning intelligibility are a key focus of this investigation, particularly as native speaker models have limited relevance to these new contexts of use. This review highlights current research from diverse areas of applied linguistics that have addressed aspects of intelligibility in both experimental and real-world settings. Current findings suggest that the processes by which understanding is achieved in English as a lingua franca (ELF) interaction are qualitatively different from those observed in native speaker (NS)-based interaction, and that this has implications for a number of research and practice areas.

[...]the close relationship between SLA and L1 loss has been implicit and explicit in a number of very recent studies stressing the nding that in many grammatical areas, bilinguals and L2 learners have been shown to end up with very similar grammars (Lynch, 1999; Sorace, 1999; 2000a; Grel, 2002; Jordens, 2002; Montrul, 2002; 2004a).

"Odlin, Terence",2005,CROSSLINGUISTIC INFLUENCE AND CONCEPTUAL TRANSFER: WHAT ARE THE CONCEPTS?,"This chapter surveys recent work on language transfer and focuses on the intersection of second language acquisition (SLA) and linguistic relativity in what is often termed conceptual transfer. The two most famous exponents of relativity, Wilhelm von Humboldt and Benjamin Lee Whorf, developed their ideas largely from their study of Kawi and Hopi respectively, and both scholars viewed crosslinguistic influence as a manifestation of the ""binding power"" (to use Whorf's characterization) of language on thought. The views of von Humboldt and Whorf diverge in some ways, and the difference is relevant not only to issues in SLA such as ultimate attainment but also to theories of linguistic relativity. Indeed, some recent work on conceptual transfer indicates that even highly proficient learners may never free themselves entirely of the ""binding power"" of L1. The research reviewed also includes work with native speakers of different languages, suggesting real cognitive differences related to language in, for example, spatial concepts. The importance of distinguishing concepts from meanings is emphasized, as is the difference between meaning transfer and conceptual transfer. The chapter discusses in detail research on transfer involving spatial, temporal, and affective meanings, with some of the studies being interpreted as evidence of conceptual transfer.

The paper includes an overview of relevant basic research (i.e., research on the phenomenon of second language writing), a discussion of relevant applied research (i.e., research on second language writing instructional principles and practices), an examination of some general issues and concerns that have important implications for second language writing instruction, and an assessment of the current status of the field along with our thoughts on where it might go in the future.

Tammy Jandrey Hertel,2003,Lexical and discourse factors in the second language acquisition of Spanish word order,"This study investigates the acquisition of Spanish word order by native speakers of English. Specifically, it considers the development of sensitivity to the distinct interpretations of subject-verb (SV) vs. verb-subject (VS) order, as determined by lexical verb class (unaccusative and unergative verbs) and discourse structure.Participants included a native speaker control group and learners at four proficiency levels. Results from a contextualized production task indicate that beginning learners transferred the SV order of English for all structures. Intermediate learners showed a gradual increase in the production of lexically and discourse-determined inversion, although their data was also characterized by indeterminacy and variability. The advanced learners demonstrated a sensitivity to the word order effects of unaccusativity and discourse factors, but also tended to overgeneralize inversion to unergative verbs in a neutral discourse context.", Journal Article,10.1191/0267658303sr224oa,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/lexical-discourse-factors-second-language/docview/200202649/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Philp, Jenefer",2003,"CONSTRAINTS ON ""NOTICING THE GAP"": NONNATIVE SPEAKERS' NOTICING OF RECASTS IN NS-NNS INTERACTION","Interaction has been argued to promote noticing of L2 form in a context crucial to learning--when there is a mismatch between the input and the learner's interlanguage (IL) grammar (Gass &amp; Varonis, 1994; Long, 1996; Pica, 1994). This paper investigates the extent to which learners may notice native speakers' reformulations of their IL grammar in the context of dyadic interaction. Thirty-three adult ESL learners worked on oral communication tasks in NS-NNS pairs. During each of the five sessions of dyadic task-based interaction, learners received recasts of their nontargetlike question forms. Accurate immediate recall of recasts was taken as evidence of noticing of recasts by learners. Results indicate that learners noticed over 60-70% of recasts. However, accurate recall was constrained by the level of the learner and by the length and number of changes in the recast. The effect of these variables on noticing is discussed in terms of processing biases. It is suggested that attentional resources and processing biases of the learner may modulate the extent to which learners ""notice the gap"" between their nontargetlike utterances and recasts.

"Iwashita, Noriko",2003,NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND POSITIVE EVIDENCE IN TASK-BASED INTERACTION: DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS ON L2 DEVELOPMENT,"This study examines the role of task-based conversation in second language (L2) grammatical development, focusing on the short-term effects of both negative feedback and positive evidence on the acquisition of two Japanese structures. The data are drawn from 55 L2 learners of Japanese at a beginning level of proficiency in an Australian tertiary institution. Five different types of interactional moves made by native speaker interlocutors during task-based interaction were identified, by way of which learners received implicit negative feedback and positive evidence about the two target structures. The relative frequency of each interactional move type was calculated, and associated changes in the learners' performance on immediate and delayed posttests were examined. It was found that, although native speaker interactional moves containing positive evidence about the two target structures were 10 times more frequent during task-based language learning than those containing implicit negative feedback, only learners who had an above-average score on the pretest benefited from the positive evidence provided. Implicit negative feedback, on the other hand, had beneficial effects on short-term development of the grammatical targets regardless of the learner's current mastery of the target structures. Moreover, recasts were found to have a larger impact than other conversational moves on short-term L2 grammatical development.

,2003,Interlanguage Pragmatics Study and Japanese Language Education,"The study of Japanese interlanguage pragmatics is a very young field. A close productive connection between the field & Japanese language education has not yet been fully constructed. One possible reason for this is that due to the lack of a comprehensive survey, it has been difficult to get an accurate overview of the findings & problems in the field. In this paper, I will first give an overview of the development of interlanguage pragmatics study abroad. Then, in comparison, I will look at the currents of interlanguage pragmatics study on L2 Japanese in Japan in order to clarify findings & problems in this field. I will then discuss applications of the findings in the study of interlanguage pragmatics to Japanese language education & point out some issues that Japanese language teachers should pay attention to in order to provide their students with appropriate pragmatic inputs. 1 Appendix, 45 References.

"Rothman, Jason;Iverson, Michael",2007,Input type and parameter resetting: Is naturalistic input necessary?*,"Recently, parameter values are assumed to be located within the lexicon of a particular grammar (Chomsky 1995, 2000). Because language-specific lexicons vary in terms of which functional categories, features and strengths they instantiate, parametric differences arise cross-linguistically; that is, the acquisition of the functional lexicon has a number of syntactic consequences, which explains cross-linguistic surface variation. [...]at both testing intervals, the L2 group differentiated between null and overt referential subject pronoun production based on type of matrix subject in conjunction with the co-reference interpretation favored by the context. [...]as compared to interval 1, the data from interval 2 indicate a modest decrease in overt subject use in OPC restricted environments (t = 1.70, p = 0.095), again comparing the mean difference of overt embedded pronoun production with QDP matrix subjects in bound variable vs. discourse referential contexts. Since parameter resetting is contingent on learning relevant properties from the input (i.e., features encoded in the lexicon and morphology), it is possible that the timing for this process of learning varies for adult learners. Since the resetting of the NSP requires the acquisition of new L2 features, the whole of the data provided is consistent with Full Access approaches to adult L2 acquisition (Duffield and White 1999; Schwartz and Sprouse 1996; White 1989) and provides evidence against so-called Failed Features models (e.g., Beck 1998; Franceschina 2001; Hawkins 2005; Hawkins and Franceschina 2004; Hawkins and Chan 1997; Liceras and Diaz 1999), which claim that the acquisition of new features (and thus parameter resetting) is impossible in adult acquisition as a result of a postcritical period inability to acquire functional features that are absent from the learner's L1.", General Information,10.1515/IRAL.2007.013,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/input-type-parameter-resetting-is-naturalistic/docview/204943963/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Li, Yan",2008,"The negation -numerical NP interaction in non -native Chinese: UG, POS problem, and syntactic analyses","This dissertation is an investigation of the possible influence of native language English (L1), and universal grammar (UG) on the acquisition of a non-native language Chinese (L2), through an examination of how English-speaking L2 Chinese learners acquire the knowledge of the interpretation of Chinese sentences containing negation (Neg) and numerically quantified noun phrases (QNP) in object position. Two research questions are investigated: (1) Can English-speaking L2 Chinese learners overcome the Poverty-of-the-Stimulus problem and produce native-like interpretation of L2 sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position? (2) If English-speaking L2 Chinese learners do overcome the POS problem, what factors in the L2 can help them to reset the parameters? Two experiments were carried out to answer these research questions. Experiment 1 employed the methodology of Truth Value Judgment Task to test English-speaking L2 Chinese learners' interpretation of sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position. The results suggest that L1 transfer occurred in the initial state of acquisition, but the POS problem can be overcome due to the accessibility of UG to L2 learners. Experiment 2 tests predications made by syntactic analyses on second language acquisition to see whether the acquisition of the interpretation of sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position is related to the acquisition of other aspects of the Chinese language. The test results indicated that the acquisition of the correct placement of adjuncts is not the trigger helping L2 learners successfully acquire the knowledge to interpret sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position. The knowledge that Chinese numerical NPs are not free to take subject position might be regulated under the same parameters as the acquisition of the interpretation of sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position. It is concluded that both the L1 and UG may inform L2 acquisition of phenomena at the syntax-semantics interpretive interface.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/negation-numerical-np-interaction-non-native/docview/304488135/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Brown, Amanda;Gullberg, Marianne",2008,BIDIRECTIONAL CROSSLINGUISTIC INFLUENCE IN L1-L2 ENCODING OF MANNER IN SPEECH AND GESTURE: A Study of Japanese Speakers of English,"Whereas most research in SLA assumes the relationship between the first language (L1) and the second language (L2) to be unidirectional, this study investigates the possibility of a bidirectional relationship. We examine the domain of manner of motion, in which monolingual Japanese and English speakers differ both in speech and gesture. Parallel influences of the L1 on the L2 and the L2 on the L1 were found in production from native Japanese speakers with intermediate knowledge of English. These effects, which were strongest in gesture patterns, demonstrate that (a) bidirectional interaction between languages in the multilingual mind can occur even with intermediate proficiency in the L2 and (b) gesture analyses can offer insights on interactions between languages beyond those observed through analyses of speech alone.

"Shin, Eun Young",2012,The Availability of Semantic and Syntactic Information and their Use as a Structural Predictor in the Real-Time Processing of L1 and L2 Korean,"The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the real-time sentence processing of Korean both by native speakers and learners in terms of the availability and the effectiveness of different types of information in the structural prediction. Built on the crosslinguistically contrastive findings between Japanese in Yoshida (2006) and Chinese in Hsu (2007), the parser in Korean is characterized in two aspects. The first aspect is whether the parser is sensitive to different types of information in on-line processing such as the semantic mismatch and the case markers. The second aspect is whether the parser makes a structural prediction based on inherently indirect cues available. In addition, the L2 parser from two language backgrounds is qualitatively compared in the same aspects. Self-paced reading time experiments were conducted with L1 Korean speakers as well as L1 Japanese and L1 English learners of Korean. The construction under discussion contained a classifier construction and the relative clause, where the semantic match between a classifier and its closest candidate licensing noun as well as the case marker of the noun was manipulated. The results showed that both L1 and L2 parsers were sensitive to the available semantic information as well as the case marker information in on-line processing. The semantic mismatch had an immediate impact while the case marker information exhibited a latent effect. As for the prediction effect, the semantic mismatch alone did not serve as an unfailing predictor of the relative clause in Korean whereas the semantic mismatch in Japanese (Yoshida, 2006) and the contextual cue in Chinese (Hsu, 2007) made a structural prediction possible. Instead, the combination of the semantic Match and the Genitive marker accelerated the processing of the upcoming relative clause in Korean. The predictive effect was not clearly observed at the expected locus of the effects in the L2 parser. In addition, there was a frequency effect at the classifier itself, which was amplified by the L2 parser. Based on the findings, this dissertation supports the claim that the parser is universally incremental and predictive, but it further argues that the degree of the predictability and the types of information used for the prediction vary depending on the language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/availability-semantic-syntactic-information-their/docview/1282652033/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Taguchi, Naoko",2011,"Do proficiency and study-abroad experience affect speech act production? Analysis of appropriateness, accuracy, and fluency","Findings generally confirmed that accuracy and fluency form distinct dimensions of pragmatic competence and do not develop in parallel. Because Taguchi (2007) is the only existing study that examined the proficiency effect in fluent speech act production, as measured by speech rate and planning time, and very little research has examined the effect of study-abroad on pragmatic fluency, more research is needed to fill die gap in me literature. [...]it seems that linguistic sophistication is a prerequisite for a successful high-imposition speech act; as a result, learners of higher proficiency demonstrated superior performance in accuracy and appropriateness of this type of speech act than the lower proficiency group. Different from pre-task planning speed, speech rate seems to more closely reflect one's overall proficiency and corresponding efficiency in dealing with linguistic resources. Because learners had to translate their pragmatic intentions into language rapidly and smoothly under the temporal constraints of on-line processing, general proficiency, which is a reflection of overall linguistic management skill and language-related experience, is likely to play a role in promoting speech rate. Because speech rate measured as words per minute is not sensitive to the nature of speech that often involves multi-word lexical chunks, future research should apply a wider range of oral fluency measures to confirm the generalizability of the present findings.", General Information,10.1515/iral.2011.015,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/do-proficiency-study-abroad-experience-affect/docview/916631990/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Research questions ask if learners differ in the transfer of pragmatic knowledge from the L1 or L2 in an oral versus written modality, and if the three learner groups differ in pragmatic expression in the two modalities. Results indicate that the groups respond differently in the two modalities, showing sensitivity to contextual constraints. Few instances of clear transfer are seen, mostly from Spanish at the single-word level.

"Taguchi, Naoko",2011,Teaching Pragmatics: Trends and Issues,"Theoretical, empirical, and practical interest in pragmatic competence and development for second language (L2) learners has resulted in a large body of literature on teaching L2 pragmatics. This body of literature has diverged into two major domains: (a) a group of experimental studies directly testing the efficacy of various instructional methods in pragmatics learning and (b) research that explores optimal instructional practice and resources for pragmatic development in formal classroom settings. This article reviews literature in these two domains and aims at providing a collective view of the available options for pragmatics teaching and the ways that pragmatic development can best be promoted in the classroom. In the area of instructional intervention, this article reviews studies under the common theoretical second language acquisition paradigms of explicit versus implicit instruction, input processing instruction, and skill acquisition and practice. In the area of classroom practice and resources, three domains of research and pedagogical practices are reviewed: material development and teacher education, learner strategies and autonomous learning, and incidental pragmatics learning in the classroom. Finally, this article discusses unique challenges and opportunities that have been embraced by pragmatics teaching in the current era of poststructuralism and multiculturalism.

"Tolentino, Leida C;Tokowicz, Natasha",2011,"ACROSS LANGUAGES, SPACE, AND TIME","This review examines whether similarity between the first language (L1) and second language (L2) influences the (morpho)syntactic processing of the L2, using both neural location and temporal processing information. Results from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP) studies show that nonnative speakers can exhibit nativelike online L2 (morpho)syntactic processing behavior and neural patterns. These findings are contrary to predictions of the shallow structure hypothesis for syntactic processing (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006a, 2006b). The data are in line with predictions of the (morpho)syntactic domain of the unified competition model of L2 acquisition (MacWhinney, 2005): Differences in L2 processing as compared to the L1 (or to native speakers of the L2) were generally associated with constructions that were crosslinguistically dissimilar or unique to the L2. The processing of crosslinguistically similar constructions generally produced no differences in brain activity between the L1 and L2. Overall, the available data suggest that cross-language similarity is an important factor that influences L2 (morpho)syntactic processing.

"Lee-Ellis, Sunyoung",2011,THE ELICITED PRODUCTION OF KOREAN RELATIVE CLAUSES BY HERITAGE SPEAKERS,"In response to new theoretical claims and inconclusive empirical findings regarding relative clauses in East Asian languages, this study examined the factors relevant to relative clause production by Korean heritage speakers. Gap position (subject vs. object), animacy (± animate), and the topicality of head nouns (± topicalization) were manipulated as experimental variables, and factors that appear to have been confounded in previous studies (e.g., context, proficiency) were controlled for or measured. Data were collected from Korean native and heritage speakers using an elicited production task. Group results failed to show a subject advantage, but individual analysis revealed that the effect of gap position varied for speakers at different levels of Korean proficiency. Results from the topicalized lead-in condition as well as error analysis revealed two different sources related to these patterns: Traditional asymmetry (i.e., subject advantage) appears to reflect the noun phrase accessibility hierarchy effect, whereas backward asymmetry (i.e., object advantage) seems to stem from word order strategy. Proficiency scores exhibited a modest correlation with the different individual response patterns. However, an animacy effect was not observed. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of a general learning strategy, language universals based on informational prominence, the role of proficiency, and the effect of task demands.

"Zaremba, Kathryn Davidson",2011,The Nature of the Semantic Scale: Evidence from Sign Language Research,"A difficult learning problem for both children and artificial language learning systems is knowing what is intended to be conveyed based on what is literally said. For example, adults usually take ""Some teas contain caffeine"" to also convey that ""Not all teas contain caffeine"", an inference known as a scalar implicature. The present work investigates the role of language-specific knowledge in such inferences through three studies on scalar implicatures in American Sign Language (ASL). The first study illustrates a new experimental paradigm and compares prototypical scalar implicatures in ASL and English. The second study includes the first investigation of general use coordinators in ASL that can be interpreted as either conjunction (""and"") or disjunction (""or""). This provides a test case for the role of language-specific lexical contrast in scalar implicatures, with results showing that lexically non-contrastive scales (i.e., lexical scales whose items differ in meaning but not in form) trigger less scalar implicatures than prototypical lexically contrastive scales, which are based on contrasting lexical items. In the third study, both lexically contrastive and non-contrastive scales are interpreted by deaf native signers and also deaf signers who learned ASL at later ages. Result show that later ASL learners calculated less implicatures than early learning signers, but only on the lexically contrastive scale. Together, these studies support a view that despite their context dependence, scalar implicatures are most likely to be triggered by lexical items which contrast with each other in form to create a context-independent ""scale"", and that there may even be advantages to learning scales early in life. The dissertation concludes with suggestions for incorporating lexical contrast into theories of implicature and for further study of the semantic/pragmatic interface in sign languages.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/nature-semantic-scale-evidence-sign-language/docview/913399804/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Gonzalez, Carolina",2011,Perception of prosody in American Sign Language,"The main goal of this dissertation is to examine the ability to use prosodic cues when parsing Intonational Phrases (IPs) in American Sign Language (ASL) by four different populations, i.e. ASL signers, Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL) signers, Non-Signers and second language (L2) signers of ASL. ASL signers, Non-Signers and L2 signers showed similar performance in terms of accuracy when identifying prosodic boundaries. Although hearing participants (i.e. Non-Signers and L2 signers) do not have a phonology for gestures, they are able to use superficial visual cues to mark prosodic boundaries based on their “gestural competence”; that is, their experience using co-speech gesture. Native HKSL signers’ performance was better overall demonstrating a greater ability to be accurate and fast when parsing ASL clauses than even native ASL signers. I argue that the ASL signers’ ability may be affected by lexical or semantic interference. Long reaction times and low accuracy levels revealed the complexity of the mental process involved in this task. When data were analyzed within group, Non-Signers as well as L2 signers showed a better performance when stimuli contained more cues. Contrary to hearing participants, the native signers groups did not show changes on accuracy depending on the number of cues. Data shows that 3-4 cues are sufficient for HKSL and ASL signers to be accurate, whereas Non-Signers and L2 signers needed more cues. HKSL signers as well as Non-Signers and L2 signers parse ASL clauses based on a broader range of cues whereas ASL signers focus just on a couple of cues when parsing ASL clauses, that is, ASL signers are sensitive to fewer cues.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/perception-prosody-american-sign-language/docview/904416342/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

The analysis of written data, their process of creating cohesion, and the interview results indicated that the way the Japanese learners create cohesion was different from their first language and that of Japanese native speakers. The cohesive ties which have equivalent ties in English were used more frequently and with less variety in the students' Japanese texts compared to their texts written in their first language and Japanese texts written by Japanese native speakers; whereas, the use of the cohesive ties which do not have their equivalent linguistic form in English were restricted. The qualitative analysis revealed that the incohesion in students' Japanese texts were affected by cognitive overload and lack of awareness of cohesive ties.

"Adams, Tuuli Morrill",2011,Word Segmentation and Phonological Learning in Cross-Language Perception of Fluent Speech,"Listeners segment words from the continuous speech stream in their native language by using rhythmic structure, phrasal structure, and phonotactics (e.g. Christophe et al, 2003: McQueen, 1998). One challenging aspect of second language acquisition is the extraction of words from fluent speech, possibly because learners apply a native language segmentation strategy to the non-native language (e.g. Cutler and Norris, 1998). This dissertation investigates native English speakers' perception of a second (non-native) language, looking at the effect of native language prosody on fluent speech perception in two experiments. In Experiment 1, learners were exposed to Finnish through a word-learning exercise, followed by exposure to fluent speech. Finnish was chosen as the language because stress is always word-initial, and this is also the most frequent stress pattern in English. In Experiment 2, the non-native language was Japanese, which has no stress pattern, but instead has lexical pitch accents. After learning words and listening to fluent speech, participants in each experiment were asked to identify possible words of the language, choosing from stimulus pairs with one real word from the speech passage, and another incorrectly segmented non-word. Participants' response patterns were analyzed using ANOVAs, and generalized linear mixed effects regression models. Results for both languages indicate that listeners who participated in word-learning tasks were better at identifying possible words than those who had only listened to fluent speech. For Finnish, the combination of word learning and fluent speech listening provided a greater advantage than word learning alone, whereas for Japanese, both groups who learned words performed about the same, although the combined tasks did lead to more consistent performance across subjects. The interaction between the prosodic patterns of the native and non-native languages has a clear effect on performance in an otherwise parallel learning environment. Implications for theories of language acquisition and speech perception are considered in the analyses.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/word-segmentation-phonological-learning-cross/docview/861478372/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Tecedor, Marta",2016,Beginning Learners' Development of Interactional Competence: Alignment Activity,"This study examined the development of interactional competence (Hall, 1993; He &amp; Young, 1998) by beginning learners of Spanish as indexed by their use of alignment moves. Discourse analysis techniques and quantitative data analysis were used to explore how 52 learners expressed alignment and changes in participation patterns in two sets of instructional peer-to-peer conversations. The results of the analyses show that, although subject to great individual variability and not always following native-like standards, English native speakers in the early stages of learning Spanish are able to express varying degrees of alignment in conversations with a peer of a similar proficiency level. As they strive to create a sphere of mutual understanding, they test different options from their linguistic repertoire and learn not only from their own attempts but also from those of their interlocutor. These results suggest that repeated engagement in interactional practice does provide the linguistic, social, and pedagogical affordances learners need to develop the interactional skills that will serve them well not only to build confidence and competence in the classroom learning context, but also hopefully in the world outside the classroom.", Journal Article,10.1111/flan.12177,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/beginning-learners-development-interactional/docview/1783692885/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Hirata, Yukari;Kelly, Spencer D",2010,Effects of Lips and Hands on Auditory Learning of Second-Language Speech Sounds,"Previous research has found that auditory training helps native English speakers to perceive phonemic vowel length contrasts in Japanese, but their performance did not reach native levels after training. Given that multimodal information, such as lip movement and hand gesture, influences many aspects of native language processing, the authors examined whether multimodal input helps to improve native English speakers' ability to perceive Japanese vowel length contrasts. Sixty native English speakers participated in 1 of 4 types of training: (a) audio-only; (b) audio-mouth; (c) audio-hands; and (d) audio-mouth-hands. Before and after training, participants were given phoneme perception tests that measured their ability to identify short and long vowels in Japanese (e.g., /kato/ vs. /kato:/). Although all 4 groups improved from pre- to posttest (replicating previous research), the participants in the audio-mouth condition improved more than those in the audio-only condition, whereas the 2 conditions involving hand gestures did not. Seeing lip movements during training significantly helps learners to perceive difficult second-language phonemic contrasts, but seeing hand gestures does not.

We provide data from successful English-speaking learners of L2 Spanish at the initial state of acquiring L3 French and L3 Italian relating to properties of the Null-Subject Parameter (e.g. Chomsky, 1981; Rizzi, 1982). We compare these groups to each other, as well as to groups of English learners of L2 French and L2 Italian at the initial state, and conclude that the data are consistent with the predictions of the 'L2 status factor'. However, we discuss an alternative possible interpretation based on (psycho)typologically-motivated transfer (borrowing from Kellerman, 1983), providing a methodology for future research in this domain to meaningfully tease apart the 'L2 status factor' from this alternative account.

We identify the variables that must be tracked in populations who experience language loss, and we develop a general model for the assessment of the processes involved. This critical review suggests that future research in this domain should establish baselines for attainment against which to measure attrition, and that learners must be compared to themselves in longitudinal designs that involve periodic assessment of both linguistic and extralinguistic factors. In the proposed model, populations are defined as sets of variables, which are subject to change following shifts in discrete time periods in the general process of acquisition and attrition. A working model is elaborated for the assessment of L2 attrition and retention, which, we hope, might encourage additional work in this area.

"Iwasaki, Noriko",2010,Style Shifts among Japanese Learners before and after Study Abroad in Japan: Becoming Active Social Agents in Japanese,"Previous studies on L2 Japanese sojourners often reported that learners overuse the plain style or haphazardly mix the plain and polite styles upon return. These styles, which are often associated with formal or informal contexts, also index complex social and situational meanings, and native speakers are reported to shift their styles to create desired contexts. In order to better understand L2 development of the use of the plain and polite styles during study abroad, the current study examined the use of the polite/plain styles and style shifts among five English-speaking male students who studied in Japan for one academic year by comparing their performances both quantitatively and qualitatively in oral proficiency interviews before and after they studied abroad. Upon return, three predominantly used the polite style talking to the interviewer (their former teacher), while two primarily used the plain style. Though the quantitative analysis may lead one to conclude that these two students regressed in their pragmatic competence, the qualitative analysis revealed that all five learners gained some understanding of social meanings of the plain and polite styles and became more active social agents who make decisions to shift the styles.

"Iwai, Tomoko",2010,Becoming a good conversationalist: Conversational competence as a target of JFL instruction,"This study investigated the effects of instruction on the JFL learners’ ability to engage in small talk using an instructional approach that uses activity as a target of instruction and pragmatics-focused instruction. Small talk was selected as the target of instruction because of its function to fulfill the intrinsically human needs for sociability. The activity of small talk was operationalized for instruction in a second-semester Japanese class through the construct coined conversational competence, the ability to co-construct involved small talk that features eight pragmatic resources. The involved small talk refers to the active and willing participation by the learners with the effective use of these resources, co-constructing such social meanings as sociability and rapport as well as various stances associated with their situated and discourse identities. By placing the focus of instruction on conversational competence, the study proposed innovation for language instruction: the adoption of activity as the main target of instruction (Yoshimi, 2003, p. 9, 2008), and the use of pragmatics-focused instruction as the main instruction. The instruction provided the students with metapragmatic information about what small talk is, it’s organizational features including relevant resources, appropriate topics, and how it is jointly accomplished by participants using explicit instruction of pragmatics. The instruction aimed to foster the students’ orientation to small talk as a social activity in which participants strive to achieve sociability, building rapport and self-presentation. The instruction also provided ample opportunities for the students to practice using the resources to engage in small talk in an open-ended, unscripted, and contingent interaction, as well as feedback. The study found that the activity-based, pragmatics-focused instruction had a facilitative role in bringing about changes in the students’ participation between the two observations before and after the instruction. Students showed their orientation to small talk as a social activity and used the resources effectively to co-construct sociability, rapport, and identity in the interaction with a native speaker.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/becoming-good-conversationalist-conversational/docview/762781741/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

This article examines how speakers of Japanese as their first language (L1) state and support their opinions. Performances of second language (L2) learners of Japanese were also examined to identify the language abilities that L2 learners may need to develop. While L1 speakers often sought common ground using various mitigation devices such as -zyanai desu ka (""isn't the case that""), -yone (""y'know""), and the modal adverb yappari (""after all, as expected""), L2 learners enrolled in a 4th-year Japanese course rarely sought common ground using these devices. In order to help L2 learners develop their ability to state and support opinions in a socioculturally appropriate way, it is important to provide guided opportunities for them to produce discourse-level exchanges beyond sentence-level opinion statements.

"Gabriele, Alison",2009,TRANSFER AND TRANSITION IN THE SLA OF ASPECT: A BIDIRECTIONAL STUDY OF LEARNERS OF ENGLISH AND JAPANESE,"Previous studies have shown that it is particularly difficult for second language (L2) learners to overcome the effects of transfer when they need to unlearn specific aspects of the native language in the absence of explicit input that indicates which properties of the first language (L1) are ruled out by the L2 grammar (Inagaki, 2001; Westergaard, 2003; White, 1991a, 1991b). The present study focuses on the effects of transfer in the domain of aspectual semantics through an investigation of the interpretation of the present progressive in L2 English and the imperfective marker te-iru in L2 Japanese and examines whether L2 learners can rule out interpretations available in the L1 but not in the L2. Japanese learners of English (n = 101), English native-speaker controls (n = 23), English learners of Japanese (n = 31), and Japanese native-speaker controls (n = 33) completed an interpretation task in English or Japanese. The results show that the L2 Japanese learners were more successful than the L2 English learners in both acquiring the semantics of the imperfective in the L2 and ruling out interpretations available only in the L1. It is proposed that successful unlearning depends on both the grammatical complexity of the semantic target in the L2 and the transparency of the input cues available to the learner.

"Alhawary, Mohammad T",2009,Speech Processing Prerequisites or L1 Transfer? Evidence From English and French L2 Learners of Arabic,"The article aims at investigating speech processing prerequisite claims made by Pienemann's Processability Theory (1998). Longitudinal data from eight English L1 and one French L1 speaker learning Arabic as an L2 were used to investigate the emergence/processing of demonstrative-predicate gender agreement and verbal agreement structures hypothesized to be processable at the same stage: Stage 4. The findings show that both forms were not processable by the English L1 participants at the same stage, as the participants seemed to encounter more problems with demonstrative-predicate agreement than with verbal agreement. The findings are further supported by cross-sectional data of 53 English and French L2 learners of Arabic, where between-group effects were found with respect to demonstrative-predicate agreement. It is concluded that this is likely due to L1 transfer-a factor not accounted for by Processability Theory.

"Song, Hyang Suk;Schwartz, Bonnie D",2009,"TESTING THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE HYPOTHESIS: L2 ADULT, L2 CHILD, AND L1 CHILD COMPARISONS IN THE ACQUISITION OF KOREAN WH-CONSTRUCTIONS WITH NEGATIVE POLARITY ITEMS","The fundamental difference hypothesis (FDH; Bley-Vroman, 1989, 1990) contends that the nature of language in natives is fundamentally different from the nature of language in adult nonnatives. This study tests the FDH in two ways: (a) via second language (L2) poverty-of-the-stimulus (POS) problems (e.g., Schwartz &amp; Sprouse, 2000) and (b) via a comparison between adult and child L2 learners, whose first language (L1) is the same, in terms of their developmental route (e.g., Schwartz, 1992, 2003). The phenomena under investigation are Korean wh-constructions with negative polarity items (NPIs). Korean has subject (S)-object (O)-verb (V) as its canonical word order and it is also a wh-in-situ language, but scrambling of the object to presubject position (i.e., movement that results in OSV word order) is generally optional; however, in the context of negative questions with a NPI subject (e.g., amwuto ""anyone""), (a) object wh-phrases must scramble on the wh-question reading and (b) the nonscrambled order has a yes/no-question reading. These properties of Korean wh-constructions with NPIs constitute POS problems for nonnatives whose L1 is English (as well as for native Korean-acquiring children). L1-English adult L2 learners (n = 15) and L1-English child L2 learners (n = 10), independently assessed for Korean proficiency, as well as L1-Korean children (n = 23) and L1-Korean adults (n = 15) completed an elicited-production task, an acceptability-judgment task, and an interpretation-verification task. The results show that (a) high-proficiency (adult and child) L2 learners performed like the native adult controls on all three tasks, thereby demonstrating L2 POS effects; and (b) adult and child L2 learners follow the same (inferred) route to convergence, a route differing from--yet subsuming--the L1-child route. Both sets of results lead us to conclude that, contra the FDH, the nature of language is fundamentally similar in natives and (adult or child) nonnatives.

This study explored the acquisition of universal quantifier sentences as reflected in the performance of three diverse college-level student groups on a multipicture sentence interpretation task. The participant groups (hearing native speakers, deaf students, and second language learners of English) all exhibited fundamental knowledge of universal lexical, semantic, and syntactic properties that contribute to quantifier sentence interpretation. The native speakers outperformed the deaf and second language groups, whose performance was strikingly parallel. Performance patterns are explained in terms of the influences of derivational economy, including the option to restrict in situ indefinite noun phrases to singleton indefinites. The symmetry effect observed in child language studies was also observed among the college-aged participants in this study. It is explained in terms of a pragmatic challenge in managing contextual information that invokes an unexpected singleton indefinite interpretation. The results contribute to the understanding of sentence comprehension under conditions of restricted learner access to target language input and underscore the value of seeking correlates of theory-internal derivational economy in language acquisition and use.

"Ohashi, Jun",2009,Natural Conversation Reconstruction Tasks: The Language Classroom as a Meeting Place,"This paper, drawing on Pratt’s notion of ‘transculturation’ and Bhabha’s ‘third space’, presents an example of language learning tasks that empower learners’ agency and promote their cross-cultural awareness and sensitivities to a different set of cultural expectations, using a naturally occurred Japanese thanking episodes. The paper discusses the merits of Natural Conversation Reconstruction Tasks (NCRTs) as a practical method for helping L2 learners develop this ‘intercultural competence’. It is based on a qualitative study of the results of one NCRT created for use in the context of teaching Japanese as a L2 in a multicultural society. It suggests the NCRT encourages the learners to explore the intersection where language use, speaker intention and L1 and L2 cultural norms meet. Such a process helps the learners become aware of socially expected patterns of communication in L1 and L2 in terms of the choices of speech act, formulaic expressions, sequential organization and politeness orientation. The learners’ comments suggest that the NCRT helps learners transcend their cultural boundaries by overcoming their narrow understanding of ‘thanking’ as ‘expressions of gratitude and appreciation’ and by cross-culturally widening their views of what counts as thanking. The NCRT with rich contextual information promotes the learners’ intercultural awareness, sensitivity to context and intercultural exploration in the space between L1 and L2, where they have authority and freedom of making sense of conversations, and pragmatics is fully integrated into language pedagogy.", Journal Article,10.5130/portal.v6i1.851,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/natural-conversation-reconstruction-tasks/docview/2201501903/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Gabriele, Alison",2010,Deriving meaning through context: Interpreting bare nominals in second language Japanese,"Previous studies on the second language acquisition of telicity have suggested that learners can use morphosyntactic cues to interpret sentences as telic or atelic even in cases where the cues differ in the first language (L1) and second language (L2) (Slabakova, 2001, 2005; Gabriele, 2008; Kaku et al., 2008a, 2008b). The present study extends this line of research by focusing on a case in which learners cannot rely on morphosyntactic cues in order to reach the appropriate aspectual interpretation. We examine the acquisition of telicity by English-speaking learners of Japanese, focusing on how learners interpret bare count nouns such as kaado 'card' that obligatorily display count noun morphosyntax in English. In Japanese, a bare noun such as kaado is ambiguous with respect to number and therefore a verb phrase such as kaado-o kakimashita 'wrote card' can be interpreted as either telic 'wrote the cards' or atelic 'wrote cards' depending on the context. The results of two studies with both intermediate (Study 1: n = 38; Study 2: n = 38) and advanced (Study 1: n = 7; Study 2: n = 10) learners of Japanese show that there are learners at both levels of proficiency that have difficulty with the interpretation of bare count nouns and assign an exclusively telic reading to a verb phrase such as kaado-o kakimashita 'wrote card'. We argue that this interpretation is due to the boundedness of count nouns in L1 English and propose that a retreat from negative transfer is difficult when there is variability in the native speaker input and when meaning has to be derived from context in the absence of morphosyntactic cues.

"Gomez-Laich, Maria Pia",2016,Second language learners’ divergence from target language pragmatic norms,"Pragmatic competence is an indispensable aspect of language ability in order for second and foreign language (L2/FL) learners to understand and be understood in their interactions with both native and nonnative speakers of the target language. Without a proper understanding of the pragmatic rules in the target language, learners may run the risk of coming across as insensitive and rude. Several researchers (Bardovi-Harlig, 2001; Kasper &amp; Rose, 2002) suggest that L2 pragmatics not only can be taught in the L2/FL classroom, but, more importantly, that explicit approaches that involve direct explanation of target pragmatic features are beneficial for learning pragmatics. Just as native speakers of a language acquire a “set of dispositions to act in certain ways, which generates cognitive and bodily practices in the individual” (Watts, 2003, p. 149), instructors can help learners to become aware of the pragmatic features that characterize the target language. Although the importance of explicit teaching of pragmatics is well recognized in the literature, learning norms and rules of pragmatics largely depends on learners’ subjectivity. Learners’ convergence or divergence from the L2 pragmatic norms, both consciously and out of awareness, sometimes depends on whether these norms fit their image of self and their L1 cultural identity. Since identity-related conflict can have significant consequences for the acquisition of second language pragmatics, failing to consider the centrality of learners’ identities will produce an inadequate understanding of SLA. This paper synthesizes studies that document the reasons why learners opt to remain foreign by resisting certain L2 practices. The following synthesis question was proposed: Why do language learners resist the pragmatic norms of the target language?", Journal Article,10.14746/ssllt.2016.6.2.4,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/second-language-learners-divergence-target/docview/2771779465/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

To examine the frequency of refusal strategies, we conducted a discourse completion test in the L1 and L2 of Russian JFL students and compared them with Russian and Japanese native speakers. The findings show that there is a hierarchical order among the factors involved in realization of request refusals. The effects of cultural and language differences are very complex and deeply intertwined with the content of refusal situations and nature of specific strategies.

Whereas spoken discourse makes greater use of finite dependent clauses functioning as constituents in other clauses, written academic discourse incorporates noun phrase constituents and complex phrases.

In the case of law students, such skills include awareness of both domestic and foreign legal systems, as well as full communicative competence in the foreign language they are going to use.

The significance of the case method is determined by the twofold goal of developing pragmatic competence via pseudo-real legal situations that provide students with legal knowledge, as well as stimulate them to be effective communicators in the legal sphere. The study took place at SPbPU and involved 120 s-year law students. The experiment conducted was aimed at comparing the case method and traditional methods used for teaching Legal English, particularly the first legal advice strategy—a component of pragmatic competence. A specific feature of the experiment was that it was organized in the form of distance learning. To collect and analyse the data of the study, a qualitative and a quantitative method were applied. The results of the study showed a high efficiency of the case method for fostering pragmatic competence in an ESP course for law students in comparison with traditional methods, which were not very efficient. Besides, the experiment showed that an on-line format may be an adequate methodological means of effectively achieving the goal in a foreign language training for professional needs in a course with a time limit.", Journal Article,10.3390/educsci12110819,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/distance-training-pragmatic-competence-law/docview/2748270715/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Zheng, Qi",2022,Variation in Interlanguage: Evidence from Internal and External Patterning of Morphosyntactic Variability in the Speech of Second Language Learners,"Language is inherently variable, and learner language is particularly variable. The variationist paradigm considers learner language a heterogeneously variable yet inherently rule-governed system. Specifically, learners’ alternation between native-like and nonnative-like variants of a variable or invariable target native speaker (NS) form constitutes learner language variation. Variation is also viewed as an indication of a transitional phase towards acquisition (e.g., Regan, 2013; Tagliamonte, 2011). With a particular concentration on second language (L2) morphosyntactic variation, this dissertation explored inter-learner variation and intra-learner variability together with interlanguage development by analyzing Japanese L2 learners’ oral performances in English oral proficiency interviews. The research observed and studied the variation pattern in the interview data and identified the linguistic, paralinguistic, and nonlinguistic factors and factor groups which may give rise to Japanese L2 learners’ repeated exercise of their interlanguage grammar for four morphosyntactic features: preposition/particle, article, object pronoun-dropping, and modal auxiliary verb. The data were analyzed by using classification trees, random forests, and mixed-effects variable rule methods which together identified a hierarchy of variable importance among potential factors and factor groups and the influential factor levels within each significant factor group. With modern mixed models, the dissertation concluded that the observed morphosyntactic variation is subject to inter-lingual and intra-learner factors. Additionally, learners may also have individualized baselines and grammar. More importantly, the findings of the current research have provided important theoretical and empirical justification on whether and how individual patterns mirror the interlanguage patterns and hence an inter-lingual developmental understanding of L2 morphosyntactic competence.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/variation-interlanguage-evidence-internal/docview/2726576860/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Zhang, Shijie",2022,The Acquisition and Use of Mandarin Relative Clauses by Monolingual and Bilingual Children and Adults,"Children have been found to understand and use relative clauses (RCs) at an early age. However, not all types of RCs are acquired at the same time, and are used with the same frequency (e.g., Diessel &amp; Tomasello, 2000, 2005). Using corpus-based and experimental methodologies, the three studies presented in this thesis investigate the acquisition and processing of different types of RCs in Mandarin, aiming to understand the mechanisms involved in the acquisition and processing of RC involving varying degrees of complexity. The first study (Chapter 3) presents a corpus analysis examining the naturalistic production of Mandarin RCs by Mandarin-speaking monolingual and heritage MandarinEnglish bilingual children (1;00-5;00). The results show that both monolingual and bilingual children produce more object RCs than subject RCs in Mandarin. This is because Mandarin object RCs resemble simple Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) sentences the children had previously acquired, and occur more frequently than subject RCs in their input. Compared to monolingual children, bilingual children produce more object RCs, suggesting that the acquisition of Mandarin RCs is not only facilitated by SVO transitives in Mandarin, but also SVO transitives in English. In contrast to the first study, the second study (Chapter 4) reports a subject RC advantage by looking at the comprehension of Mandarin subject and object RCs in heritage Mandarin-English bilingual children (4;00-10;11) and their vocabulary-matched monolingual peers (4;00-5;09). Using a character-sentence matching task, the results reveal that simple SVO transitives hinder children’s comprehension of Mandarin object RCs by misleading them to interpret the noun phrase occurring first as the head noun. Compared to monolingual children, bilingual children who are more English dominant make this type of error more frequently for Mandarin object RCs, suggesting that both English SVO transitives and language dominance contribute to cross-linguistic influence. However, unlike either the subject or object RC advantage shown in children, mixed results are found in the writing of adult Mandarin native speakers (L1) and advanced second language learners (L2) in the third study (Chapter 5). Using conditional inference trees and random forests, the results show that both adult Mandarin L1 and L2 speakers’ selection of subject and object RCs heavily depends on the discourse context that RCs are situated in. The first and second studies (Chapters 3 and 4) are novel in taking Mandarin RCs with omitted head nouns into account. In spontaneous speech (Chapter 3), the results indicate that monolingual and bilingual children as young as two can produce Mandarin RCs with omitted head nouns, and the omission of a head noun does not influence the subject-object asymmetry. Similarly, the absence of a head noun does not influence monolingual and bilingual children’s comprehension of Mandarin RCs (Chapter 4), suggesting that they are able to recover omitted head nouns from the context provided. In addition, the first and third studies (Chapters 3 and 5) also examine the matrixclause positions in which Mandarin RCs tend to occur. RCs that occur in the non-centreembedded matrix-clause position (e.g., The goat saw the horse [that hugged the pig] ) are expected to be easier to process than RCs in the centre-embedded matrix-clause position (e.g., The horse [that hugged the pig] saw the goat ), as they require lower working memory load (e.g., Gibson, 1998, 2000). Supporting this assumption, in adult Mandarin L1 and L2 speakers’ writing (Chapter 5), non-centre-embedded RCs occur more often than centreembedded RCs. Moreover, the longer the RCs, the higher the possibility they are placed in the non-centre-embedded matrix-clause position. However, in children’s spontaneous speech (Chapter 3), both monolingual and bilingual children do not show a tendency to prefer noncentre-embedded over centre-embedded RCs, which may relate to the short length of the RCs they produce. The shorter the RCs, the less memory load is needed to process centre-embedded RCs, and therefore the disadvantage of centre-embedded RCs may diminish. The three studies of this thesis present mixed findings regarding Mandarin RC processing, but consistently provide evidence to support the usage-based account. That is, the processing of RCs is shaped by an individual’s age and language experience, including input frequency, the related structures that have been acquired, language dominance and the discourse contexts that RCs tend to appear in.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-use-mandarin-relative-clauses/docview/2723856270/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Crookes, Graham V",2022,Critical language pedagogy,"There are long and diverse strands of thinking about how schools and schooling, teaching, curriculum, and learning could be conceptualized and developed so as to foster what is often loosely called social justice. Many of these strands go back (in Europe) at least to the French Revolution. The original term that encompasses this area is ‘radical pedagogy’ (that is to say, a pedagogy suitable for radicals or radical purposes; cf. Crookes, 2009). Emerging out of this area in the post-World War Two era, one version of this thought and practice that has become somewhat influential in language teaching is ‘critical pedagogy’, and ‘critical language pedagogy’ (CLP) is a key term used to refer to applications of the concepts of critical pedagogy to second language (L2) contexts.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0261444820000609,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/critical-language-pedagogy/docview/2612321037/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Poehner, Matthew E;Wang, Zhaoyu",2021,Dynamic Assessment and second language development,"This timeline is concerned with Dynamic Assessment (henceforth, DA) as it has been taken up and elaborated in contexts involving the teaching, learning, and assessment of learners of second languages (L2s). DA is distinguished by its insistence that an individual's independent performance of assessment tasks reveals only part of his/her abilities, namely those that have completed their development at the time of the assessment; insights into abilities that have begun to emerge but have not yet fully developed can be determined according to an individual's responsiveness to particular kinds of support, referred to as mediation (e.g., reminders, leading questions, hints, provision of a model, feedback), offered during the assessment as difficulties arise (Haywood &amp; Lidz, 2006). In this respect, DA differs from more conventional distinctions in assessment, such as that between assessments concerned with the results of previous learning (‘summative assessment’) and those intended to provide information relevant to subsequent instruction (‘formative assessment’). Instead, the embedding of an interactive, instructional element within the assessment procedure allows for the possibility of expanding the evidential basis upon which summative interpretations of learner abilities are made; that is, the results encompass previous learning that has resulted in both complete and partial understanding of relevant concepts. At the same time, DA serves a formative function in so far as interaction allows insights into the underlying sources of learner difficulties and the kind of support to which they are most responsive (Sternberg &amp; Grigorenko, 2002).", Journal Article,10.1017/S0261444820000555,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/dynamic-assessment-second-language-development/docview/2612320967/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Researchers have studied keigo ideologies within Japanese society and documented approaches to keigo instruction and learners' efforts to master or resist keigo. However, researchers have not studied teachers' beliefs about keigo and neither the impact of keigo ideologies on classroom practice nor teachers' views of students as legitimate Japanese speakers have been studied. The survey examines JFL teachers beliefs about keigo, approaches to teaching keigo, and beliefs about keigo's relevance for L2 speakers. Conducted within a qualitative framework, analysis of thematic coding and descriptive statistics demonstrate that respondents report different standards for L2 speakers that convey implicit native-speaker bias.

"Kashiwagi-Wood, Akiko",2021,Learning the Narrative Characteristic: Perspective Taking in Written Japanese as a Foreign Language,"Abstract-Narratives written by L2 learners are often awkward even after linguistic elements such as grammatical errors and vocabulary choices are corrected. This unnaturalness may be caused by not exploiting the appropriate cultural and language specific aspects in the target language. The current study focuses on a narrative characteristic of Japanese; perspective taking consistency in writing a story, and the uses of its associated structures. By examining intermediate L2 learners of Japanese whose L1 is English, this study seeks to prove whether classroom instruction helps to overcome unnaturalness caused by the inappropriate uses of perspective taking and not using its associated structures in the short- and long terms. The results of this study show that instruction helps L2 learners to maintain the consistent perspective both in the short- and longterms. However, the instruction seems to have not affected the L2 learners' utilization of a variety of perspective taking structures. Taken together, this study offers implications for earlier instruction on the learning of the narrative characteristic.", Journal Article,10.17507/jltr.1205.01,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/learning-narrative-characteristic-perspective/docview/2574809250/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Interpreting the semantic aspects of pitch levels therefore presents a challenge for Korean learners of English. This study investigated how 49 Korean learners of English perceived 20 English emotional utterances. Participants were asked to complete a congruency task in which they indicated whether the category of the semantic valence was congruent with the intonation type. They also described each emotional utterance by providing an adjective. The task results of Korean participants were compared with those of a control group of 49 Anglo-American students. Statistical analyses revealed that the incongruence between the semantic meaning and the intonation type interfered with American participants’ performance more than Korean participants. The adjective task results also showed that American participants were more attuned to the interplay between the semantic meaning and the intonation type than Korean participants., Journal Article,10.1017/S0272263120000674,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/crosslinguistic-study-perception-emotional/docview/2574626621/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Ishida, Mako",2021,Perceptual restoration of locally time-reversed speech: Non-native listeners' performance in their L2 vs. L1,"Nonnative listeners are generally not as good as native listeners in perceptually restoring degraded speech and understand what was being said. The current study investigates how nonnative listeners of English (namely, native Japanese speakers who learned English as a second language) perceptually restore temporally distorted speech in their L2 English as compared with native English listeners (L1 English) reported in Ishida et al. (Cognition, 151, 68-75, 2016), and as compared with the listeners' native tongue (L1 Japanese). In the experiment, listeners listened to locally time-reversed words and pseudowords in their L2 English and L1 Japanese where every 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, or 110 ms of speech signal was flipped in time-these stimuli contained either many fricatives or stops. The results suggested that the intelligibility of locally time-reversed words and pseudowords deteriorated as the length of reversed segments increased in both listeners' L2 English and L1 Japanese, while listeners understood locally time-reversed speech more in their L1 Japanese. In addition, lexical context supported perceptual restoration in both listeners' L1 Japanese and L2 English, while phonemic constituents affected perceptual restoration significantly only in listeners' L1. On the other hand, locally time-reversed words and pseudowords in L1 Japanese were much more intelligible than those in L1 English reported in Ishida et al. It is possible that the intelligibility of temporally distorted lexical items depends on the structure of basic linguistic units in each language, and the Japanese language might have a unique characteristic because of its CV and V structure.", Journal Article,10.3758/s13414-021-02258-5,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/perceptual-restoration-locally-time-reversed/docview/2555688360/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Yet how does it emerge in pragmatically mature but linguistically developing adult L2 learners? We used one comprehension and two production tasks, based on Falkum and colleagues (2017), to investigate metonymy abilities in 34 Japanese adult learners of English as an additional language (EAL) and a control group of 31 native English speakers. We also examined how time constraints and exposure to examples of referential metonymy affected production. In the comprehension task, both EAL-learner and native-speaker participants chose metonymic readings at above chance levels. In both production tasks, all participants produced innovative metonyms. Additionally, the findings indicate that, in L2, exposure to examples dramatically increases metonymy production, while time pressure decreases it.

Study findings show that, despite an invested identity as a proficient user of Japanese, the learner struggled to enact this identity in the face of two divergent language ideologies: one that promoted Japanese native speaker discourse as the goal of L2 learning and use, and one that promoted a particular Western ""foreigner"" discourse for non-native speakers of Japanese. Furthermore, a third discourse-that of the CMC platform-also affected her discursive practices, both in terms of interaction and performance of multiple identities.

"Bonan, Caterina",2021,From northern Italian to Asian wh-in situ: A theory of low focus movement,"The mainstream literature on the Romance dialects of northern Italy has explained the morphosyntax of clause-internal wh-elements in answer-seeking interrogatives as either the result of interrogative movement into the lower portion of the high left periphery (Munaro et al. 2001, Poletto &amp; Pollock 2015, a.o.), or as a canonical instance of scope construal (Manzini &amp; Savoia 2005;2011). New empirical evidence from Romance suggests that there is more at stake in the computation of wh-interrogatives than we used to think, and that neither of the existing approaches to northern Italian ‘wh-in situ’ can be maintained. Here, I argue that northern Italian dialects and Asian languages are, at least in this respect, more similar than we originally thought, and then I offer a new, derivationally economic and cross-linguistically supported understanding of the morphosyntax of northern Italian wh-in situ: the theory of wh-to-foc.

Es wurde festgestellt, dass die Erstsprache einen positiven Transfer auf das Lernen einer Zweitsprache hat, wenn die Wörter Ähnlichkeiten aufweisen. Darüber hinaus wurden die Einflüsse der kognitiven Fähigkeiten der Lernenden und ihres Erwerbsalters (AoA) auf das L2-Vokabellernen unter verschiedenen Bedingungen des L2-Vokabellernens festgestellt. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, die Auswirkungen des visuellen Kontexts und des Transfers auf das Lernen von L2-Vokabeln weiter zu untersuchen und zu klären, wie die kognitiven Fähigkeiten und das Erwerbsalter diese Auswirkungen in einem bestimmten L2-Lernkontext beeinflussen. Im Detail wurden Effekte der Ereignisdarstellung (d.h. nicht-sprachlicher visueller Kontext) untersucht sowie Transfereffekte aus der Erstsprache in die Zweitsprache im Bezug auf das Lernen von L2-Phrasenwortschatz (d.h. Verb-Nomen-Phrasen) bei erwachsenen Anfängern. Wir führten Kurzzeitexperimente zum L2-Wortschatzerwerb durch, bei denen wir die Reaktionszeiten maßen. Zwei weitere Forschungsfragen untersuchten, ob es Zusammenhänge zwischen der AoA oder den kognitiven Fähigkeiten der Lernenden und ihrem Lernerfolg beim Vokabellernen in einer kurzfristigen L2-Lernumgebung gibt. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass erwachsene L2-Anfänger*innen beim L2-Vokabellernen von visuellen Darstellungen profitierten: Sie waren unter Lernbedingungen mit Ereignissen genauer und schneller als unter Lernbedingungen ohne Ereignisse. Diese Effekte konnten in drei Experimenten nicht nur mit jungen Erwachsenen im Alter von 18 bis 31 Jahren nachgewiesen werden, sondern galten auch für Erwachsene im frühen und späten mittleren Alter von 32 bis 65 Jahren. Die vorangegangene Forschung deutete darauf hin, dass die Ähnlichkeit zwischen L1 und L2 das L2-Lernen beeinflussen könnte, jedoch nicht in diesem spezifischen L2-Lernkontext. Darüber hinaus wurde der AoA der Probanden manipuliert, was dazu führte, dass junge Erwachsene in den kognitiven Tests und bei den L2-Lernaufgaben besser abschnitten als die anderen beiden Gruppen.

"Calo, Stephanie",2021,Improving the Pronunciation of English Language Learners,"The dissertation explored the effectiveness of perceptual training with English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), for both the perception and production of three problematic vowel contrasts, /æ/-/ɛ/, /ɪ/-/ɛ/, /ɪ/-/i/. The methodology for the proposed study is based on that of Thorin et al. (2018), which conducted a perception experiment in a laboratory setting. The main goal of the dissertation was to provide a bridge between what has been successful in laboratory settings and what could realistically be offered in a more traditional classroom setting. The study compared three groups: Treatment 1 received a weekly 15-minute pronunciation lesson and a 10-minute perceptual training session for six weeks, Treatment 2 received a weekly 25-minute pronunciation lesson for six weeks, and the control group and did not receive any instruction. There were two main forms of assessment utilized throughout the study: identification tasks and recordings. The identification tasks assessed students’ ability to perceive different vowel sounds. The recordings were used to assess students’ gains in production. Praat, a computer software package for speech analysis, was used to obtain the formant measures of the pre- and post-test production data. The results showed that Treatment 1 led to the improvement and retention of participants’ perception of the three vowel contrasts. However, neither treatment group showed retained improvement in vowel production over the course of the semester. Therefore, it can be concluded that six weekly sessions of training focused on three vowel contrasts may facilitate long-term gains in perception, but not in production. Learners may require exposure to longer and more intense training sessions, which may not be possible to replicate in a typical classroom. Therefore, more research needs to be conducted to find treatment that is not only effective but could realistically be completed in a classroom.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/improving-pronunciation-english-language-learners/docview/2678814182/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Woods, Haruka",2021,L2 Acquisition of Interface Properties: Case of Japanese <i>Wa</i> and <i>Ga</i>,"This study investigates the second language (L2) acquisition of interface properties, with special focus on the Japanese particles wa and ga . The choice between wa and ga , which are often referred to as 'topic marker' and 'nominative case marker' respectively, is under influence of semantic (e.g. Noda 1996, Masuoka 1987) and discourse (e.g. Kuno 1975) information; in other words, it is a multiple-interface property (Montrul 2011). Based on the vulnerability in L2 acquisition of interface properties reported in previous studies (e.g. Sorace 2005), it is predicted that the difficulty in the L2 acquisition of wa and ga also stems from its characteristics as an interface property. It has also been argued that interface properties can cause residual difficulties at the near-native level and might not be fully acquirable by L2 speakers, i.e. Interface Hypothesis (Sorace and Filiaci 2006). However, in previous studies on L2 acquisition of wa and ga , the affecting factors on the choice between these particles have been mainly examined individually and not enough attention has been paid to the potential interactions between these factors. Therefore, how multiple-level factors affect Japanese L2 learners' choice between wa and ga remains a mystery. In order to uncover this mystery, the current study investigates the effect of various factors and their interactions on Japanese L2 learners' use of wa and ga . In this study, 134 L1 English / L2 Japanese speakers with beginner, intermediate, advanced and upper-advanced proficiency levels and 36 Japanese native speakers participated in an online cloze test. These participants were instructed to choose either wa or ga to mark a nominative NP in experimental sentences that were under various semantic and discourse conditions. The collected data was analysed statistically using binomial logistic regression. The results show significant interactions between a discourse factor on one hand and semantic factors on the other in L2 grammar, which means that the effect of discourse on the choice between wa and ga varies depending on the semantic characteristics of the sentence. The results of the follow-up interviews, which were conducted with 10 participants with various proficiency levels, also support these statistical results. Further, the results indicate that the difference between native and non-native speakers is mainly caused by non-native speakers' lower ability to reflect discourse information onto the choice of particle, which results in higher susceptibility to semantic factors. Finally, the results show that there is a significant gap between native speakers and upper-advanced speakers in their ability to process large amount of discourse information, providing supporting evidence to the Interface Hypothesis.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-acquisition-interface-properties-case-japanese/docview/2665127330/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"King, Levi",2021,Semantic Analysis of Image-Based Learner Sentences,"An intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL) system is an application to provide users instruction and practice as they learn a second language. In order to be more effective and more widely adopted, ICALL must better align with second language acquisition (SLA) research, moving away from menu-based or fill-in-the-blank exercises and toward the task-based and communicative methods the research supports. As a first step in this direction, this dissertation presents a mechanism by which an ICALL system can judge the appropriateness of an advanced English learner’s response to an image-based prompt simply by comparison with a collection of crowdsourced native speaker (NS) responses. It relies on well-established natural language processing (NLP) techniques, namely syntactic dependency parsing, lemmatization and term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf). To ensure broader success, this method was designed to be flexible, expandable and low-cost by relying on readily available tools and using crowd- sourced models instead of custom rules or expert knowledge. Compared to more advanced machine learning NLP approaches, my system maintains a high degree of transparency, making it ideal for integration with an ICALL feedback module. To evaluate my approach, I collected a corpus of over 13,000 picture description task (PDT) responses from NSs and English learners. I developed and applied an annotation scheme of five binary features intended to capture aspects of nativelikeness and semantic appropriateness, and showed these features to have a high degree of inter-annotator agreement. I used a preference task to establish feature weights and benchmark rankings of learner responses. I showed that my system output generally correlates well with the benchmark rankings and shows a promising degree of accuracy in predicting the annotations.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/semantic-analysis-image-based-learner-sentences/docview/2622624682/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

The present study used a minimal pair respective to stress location (e.g., OBject versus obJECT) obtained from a publicly available Mandarin Accented English Electromagnetic articulography corpus dataset. In the acoustic domain, the use of acoustic parameters (duration, intensity, F0, and vowel quality) was measured in stressed and unstressed vowels. In the articulatory domain, the positional information from tongue tip (TT), tongue dorsum (TD), upper lip (UL), lower lip (LL), and jaw (JAW) were retrieved from the concurrent vowel data. Finally, the acoustic and articulatory correlation was computed and compared both within and across groups. The acoustic analysis demonstrated that L2 speakers significantly differentiated the stressed vowels from the unstressed vowels using all suprasegmental cues, while vowel quality was extremely limitedly used in the L2 group. In the articulatory analysis, Mandarin L2 speakers demonstrated the extremely limited lexical stress effect. A significant difference as a function of lexical stress was noted only in the vertical dimension of low-back vowels. The acoustic and articulatory correlation results revealed a relatively weaker correlation in L2 speakers than in L1 speakers. In the L2 group, certain articulators such as TD and the JAW demonstrated a stronger correlation than LL and TT.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/lexical-stress-realization-mandarin-second/docview/2572931974/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

The first section of this review examines the cognitive aspects of second language (L2) Japanese development, focusing on vocabulary and kanji (i.e., Chinese characters transferred into Japanese) learning, syntactic development, and the issues surrounding reading and writing. The second part investigates sociocultural issues in L2 Japanese development and use, including pragmatic development, multilingual/translingual perspectives, and multilingual youth. The third section explores the role of affective variables (primarily learner motivation) in L2 Japanese development. The last section considers various pedagogical issues, including corpus-based studies and the development of materials and resources, instructional designs and classroom studies, technology-enhanced language learning and new instructional models, critical approaches to teaching Japanese and content-based instruction. The review of these themes illuminates trends and emerging areas of interest in post-2010 L2 Japanese research inspired by current developments in applied linguistics and second language acquisition (SLA) research, as well as unique features of Japanese language and sociocultural contexts.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0261444820000336,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/trends-developments-l2-japanese-research-2010s/docview/2475061296/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Tsuchiya, Shinsuke",2020,The native speaker fallacy in a U.S. university Japanese and Chinese program,"Informed by concepts of native speakers, racial nativism, and language socialization theory, this study documented the existence of the native speaker fallacy (Phillipson, 1992, Linguistic imperialism. Oxford: Oxford University Press) in a university-level Japanese and Chinese program in the United States. Specifically, the researcher collected survey responses from language teachers and students, conducted interviews, and observed the teacher training process, one-on-one teaching sessions, and classroom teaching over the course of 2 academic years. A regression analysis showed how the perception of native and non-native speakers was significantly influenced by students' language level, native language, and race, and by the language program itself. The cases of a dialectal speaker and biracial Japanese teachers illustrated the effects of the bifurcated categorizations on teachers who do not fit in the dichotomy. Implications derived from this study call for critical analysis of the valorization of standard dialect and investigation into ways that will make more room for diversity in the language classroom. This study also underscores the importance of debriefing meetings that allow language professionals and students to reflect their teaching and learning experiences in relation to their identities and to examine unquestioned assumptions about language and racial identities and language standardization in increasingly globalized and diverse communities.", Journal Article,10.1111/flan.12475,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/native-speaker-fallacy-u-s-university-japanese/docview/2497229996/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
Santoro Maurizio,2020,The Acquisition of English Anaphoric Expressions by Adult Chinese Speakers,"The present study has investigated the occurrence of the English anaphoric expressions, he/she, in L2 grammars. Adult Chinese learners of English were evaluated on whether they were able to provide a correct semantic interpretation of these pronouns when they appeared in complex sentences (subordinate + matrix) and correlative structures. Results have shown that L2 learners did not encounter any major difficulties in identifying the appropriate antecedents of these pronominal forms and were almost as accurate as English native speakers. This positive acquisition scenario clearly indicates that a correct reference production of English anaphors is attainable despite the visible differences between the two languages. Theoretically, it seems to support some form of Continuity in SLA; it is also consistent with the idea that internal interface phenomena are fully acquirable and are not subject to fossilization ( Interface Theory , Sorace in Biling Lang Cogn 7:143–145, 2004; Linguist Approaches Biling 1:1–33, 2011). Furthermore, L2 structures partially present in L1 grammar are attainable without necessarily relying on learners’ first language (contra Failed Functional Features Hypothesis , Hawkins and Chan in Second Lang Res 13:187–226, 1997). In fact, contrary to previous L2 studies, no visible L1 transfer effects were observed in the data.", Journal Article,10.1007/s10936-020-09717-4,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/acquisition-english-anaphoric-expressions-adult/docview/2435333506/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Malmir, Ali;Derakhshan, Ali",2020,Identity Processing Styles as Predictors of L2 Pragmatic Knowledge and Performance: A Case of Common English Speech Acts,"Identity processing styles are those psychological, sociocultural, and socio-cognitive mechanisms that shape, reshape, and establish different individuals’ identities both in their mother tongues and in the second or foreign language they are striving to acquire. The relationship between these identity processing styles and L2 learners’ pragmatic competence is a crucial issue that has not been explored thus far in an EFL context. Therefore, the present study sought to investigate the relationship between the information-oriented, diffuse-avoidant, and normative identity processing styles as measured by Berzonsky’s (2011) Identity Processing Style Inventory (ISI-4) and L2 speech-act knowledge and production among 122 (82 F and 40 M) Iranian upper-intermediate to advanced proficiency level learners. A validated 35-item multiple-choice discourse completion test (MDCT) including five frequent English speech acts (requests, apologies, refusals, complaints, and compliments/compliment responses) and a related role-play interactive test were then employed. The application of multiple regression revealed that diffuse-avoidant and normative identity processing styles were significant but moderate contributors to both pragmatic knowledge and production; however, information-oriented identity processing style was a weak significant predictor. These findings imply that teachers can manage and tailor the instructional pragmatic practices in accordance with the learners’ identity processing styles.", Journal Article,10.22051/lghor.2020.31583.1315,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/identity-processing-styles-as-predictors-l2/docview/2707833531/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

This paper focuses on how gesture can be productively used to help students notice and subsequently correct their pronunciation errors, both segmental and suprasegmental errors. First, a critical review of the literature is presented in which we carefully explore recent research on oral corrective feedback and the role that gesture plays in facilitating comprehension and acquisition. Next, pedagogical implications are considered in which we discuss a pedagogical framework that language teachers can use as a guide for incorporating gestures in pronunciation instruction.

Specifically, it considered which segmentals and features resulting from Korean phonotactics cause a breakdown in Korean speakers' L2 English intelligibility and comprehensibility for Mandarin L1-background L2 English speakers. As Korean speakers use English as a lingua franca primarily with their L1 Mandarin speaking neighbours, recordings of scripted and unscripted speech of Korean university students were sent to L1 Mandarin raters in mainland China and Taiwan, who rated utterances for intelligibility and comprehensibility. Findings showed that the most frequently mistranscribed features were epenthesis (inclusion of extra vowels to separate clustered consonants), substitution of nasals for plosives between vowels and sonorant consonants, and the consonant-vowel combination [wʊ]. Findings also suggest that less problematic features, such as [əʊ], /r/, and the distinction between [ʊ] and [u], are at times aided by similar realisations by L2 listeners.", Journal Article,,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/intelligibility-comprehensibility-korean-english/docview/2394755180/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Eizaga-Rebollar, Bárbara;Heras-Ramírez, Cristina",2020,Assessing pragmatic competence in oral proficiency interviews at the C1 level with the new CEFR descriptors,"The study of pragmatic competence has gained increasing importance within second language assessment over the last three decades. However, its study in L2 language testing is still scarce. The aim of this paper is to research the extent to which pragmatic competence as defined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) has been accommodated in the task descriptions and rating scales of two of the most popular Oral Proficiency Interviews (OPIs) at a C1 level: Cambridge’s Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) and Trinity’s Integrated Skills in English (ISE) III. To carry out this research, OPI tests are first defined, highlighting their differences from L2 pragmatic tests. After pragmatic competence in the CEFR is examined, focusing on the updates in the new descriptors, CAE and ISE III formats, structure and task characteristics are compared, showing that, while the formats and some characteristics are found to differ, the structures and task types are comparable. Finally, we systematically analyse CEFR pragmatic competence in the task skills and rating scale descriptors of both OPIs. The findings show that the task descriptions incorporate mostly aspects of discourse and design competence. Additionally, we find that each OPI is seen to prioritise different aspects of pragmatic competence within their rating scale, with CAE focusing mostly on discourse competence and fluency, and ISE III on functional competence. Our study shows that the tests fail to fully accommodate all aspects of pragmatic competence in the task skills and rating scales, although the aspects they do incorporate follow the CEFR descriptors on pragmatic competence. It also reveals a mismatch between the task competences being tested and the rating scale. To conclude, some research lines are proposed.", Journal Article,10.1515/lpp-2020-0005,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/assessing-pragmatic-competence-oral-proficiency/docview/2451525552/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

It starts by considering what aspects of ability in pragmatics to assess, and then contrasts the trade-off between the feasibility of obtaining data and the ultimate importance of the data. Next, the conspicuous lack of assessment of ability in L2 pragmatics in language classes is noted. Then follow sections on topics all relating primarily to the assessment of pragmatics for research purposes – the use of mixed methods, data elicitation procedures, and norms used in determining the appropriateness of any given performance in pragmatics. The last two topics deal, respectively, with the perceived relevance of the given assessment by the learners and with the value of collecting verbal report data from the respondents as a means for validating the assessment measures.

"Strawbridge, Arthur McReynolds",2020,The Social Networks: Characterizing L2 Spanish Proficiency Development in Study Abroad Through Social Network Analysis,"This study examines the social network development of L2 Spanish learners over the course of an academic semester spent studying abroad in Spain. Social network analysis has been utilized widely in sociological research to understand and predict a range of human behaviors, and has also been applied to research in sociolinguistics (Milroy, 1980) and second language acquisition (SLA) (e.g., Baker-Smemoe et al., 2014; Isabelli-García, 2006; Mitchell et al., 2017). The present investigation proposes to utilize this level of analysis to identify patterns in university sojourners’ social experience, to describe the relationship between these patterns and L2 Spanish proficiency development, and to contextualize these findings within the landscape of contemporary U.S. study abroad practice. Data for this investigation were collected from 43 L2 Spanish learners who were university students enrolled in various institutions in the U.S., and who spent the spring 2019 academic semester studying abroad in Spain. Students were recruited from six study abroad programs located in four cities in Spain (Granada, Madrid, Sevilla, Toledo). Social network data were collected via a specially designed social network questionnaire, while linguistic data were collected via the administration of two Spanish language proficiency tests, a Diploma de Español como Lengua Extranjera (DELE) exam and an elicited imitation task (EIT) (Ortega, Iwashita, Norris, &amp; Rabie, 1999). Data collection was performed at the beginning and end of the participants’ sojourn in Spain, a period of time lasting approximately 12 weeks. The results of this study identify four prominent social network patterns exhibited by students during their time abroad, characterized by varying levels of Spanish language use, emotional proximity to contacts, frequency of interaction, contact nationality, and network cohesion. These patterns exert a significant influence on learners’ gains in Spanish proficiency, with the most powerful influences on proficiency gains being the development of Spanish language-dominant social networks with NNS program peers, as well as the development of high numbers of integrated NS/NNS social groups. These findings are discussed in the context of the current state of U.S. study abroad programming.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/social-networks-characterizing-l2-spanish/docview/2444805016/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Patterson, Kyle",2022,"Understanding the Modern Language Student: Where Spectator and Actor Meet in the Theater, in Front of the Screen, and in the L2 Classroom","This dissertation is to explore the academic efficacy and relevance of two comparatively new technologies, video games and Virtual Reality (VR), how they relate to an older cultural phenomenon, theater, and how a discussion of both topics can result in a better understanding of how to supply students in the classroom with the chance to improve various aspects of their L2 acquisition. Examples of these improved aspects within the field of SLA are more often associated with things like vocabulary and grammar. In fact, this has been an extremely popular direction to go in since games were first brought to language classrooms (vocabulary in particular). Aside from lexical and grammatical gains due to gamification, though, there are other aspects to be improved like students’ sense of identification, their ability to interact with narratives, their various forms of engagement, and their sense of immersion within the classroom space. This dissertation will help to move the discussion of gaming in this other direction. This project aims to provide and detail an alternative to those looking for a technologically and/or theatrically relevant or game-based teaching method to support students’ language learning; Digital Game Based Language Learning (DGBLL), a subfield of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL), prizes and plays with various concepts that have come naturally to theater for centuries (e.g., contextualization and verisimilitude), while simultaneously extending a hand toward those who are technologically inclined or interested in incorporating gameful or theatrical tactics in their classroom.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/understanding-modern-language-student-where/docview/2787127079/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Tsukada, Kimiko;Idemaru, Kaori",2022,Effects of First Language Background and Learning Experience in Perceiving Mandarin Lexical Tones: Learners and Nonlearners From English- and Japanese-Speaking Backgrounds,"Purpose: This research compared individuals from two first language (L1) backgrounds (English and Japanese) to determine how they may differ in their ception of tones (Tones 1 vs. 2 |T1-T2], Tones 1 vs. 3 |T1-T3], Tones 1 vs. 4 |T1-T4], Tones 2 vs. 3 [T2-T3], Tones 2 vs. 4 |T2-T4], Tones 3 vs. 4 |T3T4]) on account of their L1. Method: The participants included two groups of learners of Mandarin (23 English speakers, 18 Japanese speakers), two groups of nonleamers of Mandarin (24 English speakers, 21 Japanese speakers), and a control group of 10 Mandarin speakers. A four-alternative forced-choice discrimination task that included 360 trials was presented in three blocks of 120 trials. Results: The native Mandarin group was more accurate in their tonal discrimination of all six tone pairs than all the nonnative groups. While Japanese nonlearners generally outperformed English nonlearners in their overall perception of Mandarin lexical tones, L1-based differences were less extensive for the two groups of learners. Both learner groups were least accurate on T2-T3 and most accurate on T3-T4. Conclusion: The results suggest that with classroom experience, English speakers can overcome their initial disadvantage and learn lexical tones in a new language as successfully as speakers of Japanese with classroom experience.", Journal Article,10.1044/2021_JSLHR-21-00146,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effects-first-language-background-learning/docview/2647408532/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Shoji, Shinichi",2022,"Syntactic, Semantic and Discourse Effects on the Processing of Scrambled Japanese Sentences","In Japanese sentences, the default word order is 'subject-object-verb' (SOV). However, Japanese allows scrambling of noun phrases (NPs), for example 'object-subject-verb' (OSV) as opposed to the unscrambled default order. Two self-paced reading experiments in the moving window paradigm were conducted to test the effects of syntax, semantics and discourse in native Japanese and native English speakers' processing of scrambled Japanese sentences. The first experiment examined how the syntactic factor (NP order) and semantic factor (NP animacy) affect processing of Japanese sentences. Results revealed that animacy difference between the subject-NP and object-NP contributes more to native English speakers' processing than default SOV word order, whereas no such difference was found for native Japanese speakers. The second experiment examined the discourse effect in processing of scrambled OSV sentences. The experiment revealed that the processing of Japanese scrambled sentences is facilitated by the preceding context for both native Japanese and English speakers.", Journal Article,10.17507/jltr.1303.04,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/syntactic-semantic-discourse-effects-on/docview/2665173609/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Hirakawa, Makiko",2001,L2 ACQUISITION OF JAPANESE UNACCUSATIVE VERBS,"This paper reports on an experimental study that investigates the acquisition of Japanese unaccusative verbs by English-speaking learners. Following Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1995), it is assumed that unaccusativity is syntactically represented but semantically determined. The experiment is devised specifically to examine whether L2 learners are sensitive to syntactic and semantic properties associated with unaccusative verbs in Japanese, which contrast with the properties of unergative verbs. In particular, the experiment involved picture tasks with two structures: the takusan construction as a syntactic test and the -teiruconstruction as a semantic test. Overall results of the experiment show that L2 learners generally know the properties investigated; that is, that subjects of unaccusative verbs originate in object position, and semantic notions such as telicity and change of state are aspects of meaning relevant to the classification of unaccusativity in Japanese. Based on these results, it is argued that the mapping of verb arguments to syntactic positions is not random, but rule governed, for most of the L2 learners in the present study.

"Oshita, Hiroyuki",2001,THE UNACCUSATIVE TRAP IN SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION,"The distinction of two types of intransitive verbs--unergatives (with underlying subjects) and unaccusatives (with underlying objects)--may not exist at early stages of L2 acquisition, both being syntactically represented as unergatives. This idea, referred to here as the Unaccusative Trap Hypothesis, provides an elegant developmental account for a variety of seemingly unrelated syntactic phenomena in L2 English, Japanese, and Chinese. Target language input, structural constraints on natural language linking rules, and linguistic properties of a learner's L1s shape stages in the reorganization of the lexical and syntactic components of interlanguage grammars. Although nonnative grammars may initially override the structural constraints postulated as the Unaccusative Hypothesis (Burzio, 1986; Perlmutter, 1978) and the Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (Baker, 1988), at later developmental stages some may still achieve conformity with the norms of natural languages.

"Johnstone, Richard",2002,Research on language teaching and learning: 2001,"As is customary in this annual review, the focus is on research which has been published mainly in international research journals and which has a bearing on the teaching of languages and on those aspects of languages learning and use which seem to have implications for teaching. For the most part, it is additional languages which are under discussion, whether of the second, (third, fourth) or modern foreign or some other variety. 2001 yielded a large number of valuable articles of this sort. Rather than seeking to mention them all, I have made a selection in order to allow certain themes to be developed. Three themes seemed to me to be of particular interest in 2001: 'Focus on form', 'Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and languages' and 'Early language learning'. None of these of course represents a new area of research, but in 2001 they seemed to play strongly. My review begins with a discussion of each of these in turn. In the sections to follow, cross-reference is made to the abstracts in Language Teaching.

"Alzahrani, Alaa",2025,The Predictive Processing of Number Information in L1 and L2 Arabic Speakers,"Prior research has shown that people can predict the syntactic features of an upcoming word during sentence comprehension. However, evidence for morphosyntactic predictive processing has been limited to gender or case marking in a small subset of Indo-European languages. In the current study, we implemented the eye-tracking visual world paradigm to investigate whether L1 ( n = 18) and L2 ( n = 40) Arabic speakers could extract number information from singular-marked verbs to anticipate the next noun. In a between-subject design, L1 and L2 speakers heard the singular verb in the simple past form (Exp 1) and the progressive past form (Exp 2). The effect of L2 proficiency (measured using a C-test and a receptive vocabulary test) on number prediction was also examined. L1 Arabic speakers showed earlier and stronger number prediction effects regardless of verb aspect. In contrast, L2 speakers exhibited delayed (Exp 1) or limited (Exp 2) prediction, suggesting a mediating role for verb aspect. Increased L2 proficiency did not influence anticipatory eye-movements during the verb region, and only emerged as significant during the noun region. These results confirm and extend earlier research on L1 and L2 number predictive processing.", Journal Article,10.3390/languages10020025,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/predictive-processing-number-information-l1-l2/docview/3171061213/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Hirata, Yukari;Friedman, Erica;Kaicher, Caroline;Kelly, Spencer D",2024,"Multimodal training on L2 Japanese pitch accent: learning outcomes, neural correlates and subjective assessments","Japanese pitch accent is phonemic, making it crucial for second-language learners to acquire. Building on theories of multimodal learning, the present study explored how auditory, visual and gestural training of Japanese pitch accent affected behavioral, neural and meta-cognitive aspects of pitch perception across two experiments. Experiment 1 used a between-subjects pre/posttest design to train native English speakers to perceive Japanese pitch accents in one of the following three conditions: (1) baseline (audio + flat notation), (2) pitch height notation (audio + notation mimicking pitch height) and (3) pitch height notation + a left-hand gesture (L-gesture) (to engage the contralateral right hemisphere specialized for suprasegmental pitch processing). Our results indicated that (2) pitch height notation training was most robust in its benefits, as participants in this condition improved on trained and novel words alike. Experiment 2 used a within-subjects design to extend Experiment 1 in three ways: adding a right-hand gesture (R-gesture) condition (to engage more segmental language areas in the left hemisphere), introducing a neural correlate of cognitive load (measured by EEG alpha and theta power) and performing a metacognitive subjective assessment of learning (e.g., ‘Which training did you find the most helpful?’). The results showed that although there were no differences among our four training conditions on learning outcomes or EEG power, participants made the most positive subjective evaluations about pitch height notation and R-gesture training. Together, the results suggest that there may be a ‘just right’ amount of multimodal instruction to boost learning and increase engagement during foreign language pitch instruction.", Journal Article,10.1017/langcog.2024.24,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/multimodal-training-on-l2-japanese-pitch-accent/docview/3141169010/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Mootoosamy, Khomeshwaree;Aryadoust, Vahid",2024,Transitioning from Communicative Competence to Multimodal and Intercultural Competencies: A Systematic Review,"The formulation of the construct of communicative competence (CC) was the consequence of the perceived “inappropriateness” of the theory of linguistic competence and performance. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of second language (L2) CC, a systematic review of 85 studies was conducted to assess how empirical studies have defined and operationalized the construct in the context of L2 learning and assessment. Four main themes emerged from the papers: (1) beliefs and perceptions about CC, (2) expansion of CC, (3) mixed specifications of CC, and (4) tests and measures of CC and communicative language ability (CLA). The analysis of these themes foregrounded several significant findings. First, the construct of L2 CC was significantly more prevalent in the body of research compared to L2 CLA. Second, CC has been perceived as a multifarious construct that has been researched from varied perspectives. It was found that older studies were more consistent with traditional approaches to defining CC and CLA, while the construct shifted focus to technology and self-appraisals in more recent studies. Third, there is no consensus amongst the reviewed studies about tests and methods of operationalization of CC, suggesting that the evidence provided is sample-specific and non-replicable. Importantly, it was found that over the years, CC has undergone a gradual evolution. With the multimodal and intercultural turn, CC has branched into new concepts namely intercultural and multimodal communicative competencies. Pertaining to these concepts, new notions such as telecollaboration, digital literacies, and multiliteracies have emerged. CC has also been, for long, analogous to performance, proficiency, social rules of language use, rules of appropriateness, willingness to communicate, self-perceptions of CC, and the goal of being a native speaker, which can add to the confusion surrounding the construct. The implications of the present research synthesis are two-fold. It becomes imperative to adapt world language classrooms to the rising trend in intercultural and multimodal communicative competencies. In addition, further replicable investigations should focus on developing optimal methods of operationalization that are in line with the new contemporary theoretical frameworks of language in the age of digital technologies and artificial intelligence.", Journal Article,10.3390/soc14070115,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/transitioning-communicative-competence-multimodal/docview/3085021521/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Hae Ree Jun;Mu, Bing",2024,An Ecological Perspective on Agency: L2 Learners’ Sociopragmatic Interpretations and Strategies in a Study Abroad Context,"In applied linguistics, there has been a growing body of L2 pragmatics studies that investigate the intricate relationship between language learners’ subjective pragmatic choices and various contextual factors. The current study contributes to the understanding of language learner agency by illustrating the complex processes through which language learners enact their agency in response to varying contextual factors when making their sociopragmatic interpretations and strategies. To capture the ecological nature of agency, this study conceptualizes agency as contextually, interpersonally, intrapersonally, spatially, and temporally embedded. Through the in-depth examination of the accounts of three L2 learners of Japanese regarding their interactions with religious group members during their study abroad in Japan, this study demonstrates language learners’ divergent ways of enacting their agency, stemming from their orientations to the unique configurations of various contextual attributes in the L2 interactions. Such differences were rooted in and guided by their past experiences, present environments, and future aspirations that impacted their sociopragmatic perceptions, expectations, and choices. This study provides a complicated picture of language learner agency as a dialogic and reflexive process in which learners interact with contextual factors and adapt their sociopragmatic choices. Thus, it calls for an ecological, processual, and holistic approach to language learner agency through the close examination of the ways in which various contextual factors come together in L2 interactions, the process of how language learners orient to dynamic configurations of contextual factors, and what guides such orientations.", Journal Article,10.3390/languages9050174,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/ecological-perspective-on-agency-l2-learners/docview/3059527212/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Mishina-Mori, Satomi;Nakano, Yuki;Yujobo, Yuri Jody;Kawanishi, Yumiko",2024,Is Referent Reintroduction More Vulnerable to Crosslinguistic Influence? An Analysis of Referential Choice among Japanese–English Bilingual Children,"This study aims to examine whether a crosslinguistic influence (CLI) is exerted on the referring expressions of the spoken narratives of Japanese–English bilingual children in different discourse contexts. Thirteen early bilingual (school-age) children separately presented Japanese and English narratives for a wordless picture book and a speechless video clip. Further, seven Japanese and nine English monolingual children participated as controls. The linguistic devices that the children adopted to introduce, reintroduce, and maintain the topic were compared with those of their monolingual controls to detect any CLI. As predicted, CLI for English on Japanese was observed but not vice versa. In Japanese, bilinguals utilize significantly more noun phrases (NPs) compared with their monolingual counterparts. More crucially, this was observed only in the referent reintroduction context, indicating that only discourse contexts that require the integration of much pragmatic information may be vulnerable to English influence. Null forms are barely utilized in English narratives; thus, no influence from Japanese was observed. We present the referential choice patterns in the elicited spoken narratives of bilingual school-age children acquiring an under-researched language pair. By controlling for the discourse context, we demonstrate that CLI is more likely to manifest in the reintroduction context. These findings offer additional evidence for the interface and structural overlap hypothesis, further highlighting the criticality of considering information structure as an influencing condition.", Journal Article,10.3390/languages9040120,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/is-referent-reintroduction-more-vulnerable/docview/3046935305/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Sánchez-Hernández, Ariadna;Barón, Júlia;Llanes, Àngels",2024,The Development of Pragmatic Markers in English as a Second Language: Do Age and Learning Context Matter?,"The present study explores the development of pragmatic marker (PM) use by children and adult L2 English learners in two learning contexts: study abroad (SA) and at home (AH). The study involved a group of 35 Catalan/Spanish girls (aged 11 to 13) learning English AH ( n = 16) and abroad in Ireland ( n = 19), and a group of 16 adult students aged 19–31 learning English in the UK and Ireland ( n = 10) and at their home university in Barcelona ( n = 6). To test their pragmatic development, the use of PMs was prompted through pre-test and post-test semi-structured interviews. The results indicated an effect of both age and context on PM development. Children in the SA context increased their use of some PMs, whereas their peers who remained at home did not show any development. Regarding the adults, both SA and AH participants increased their use of specific PMs. These findings shed some light on a topic that has not received scholarly attention in the field of L2 pragmatics: the development of PM use by children. Additionally, they contribute to the very small body of longitudinal studies on the development of PM use during SA.", Journal Article,10.3390/languages9040115,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/development-pragmatic-markers-english-as-second/docview/3046935137/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Tajeddin, Zia;Khanlarzadeh, Neda",2024,The Role of Learner Variables in Pragmatic Development during Study Abroad: A Systematic Review,"As one of the productive approaches to L2 pragmatic development, study abroad (SA) has drawn the attention of numerous researchers during the past few decades. Different factors, specifically those related to L2 learners, implicate the impact of SA on pragmatic development. The present systematic review aims to identify the roles of individual differences, including personal as well as social and cognitive variables, on the pragmatic development of L2 learners who were involved in SA programs. To this end, 39 studies from peer-reviewed journals and books published from 2000 to 2022 were scrutinized. The results revealed that a substantial amount of research has been conducted on the intersection of L2 pragmatic competence and SA. However, more studies are required to investigate the impact of learner variables on different aspects of L2 pragmatics in the SA context. The results also indicated the extent to which learner variables were analyzed in these studies and how each variable impacted the effectiveness of SA programs. In addition to the effects of learner variables, the methodological features of the studies, including the context of the studies, designs of the studies, data sources, and characteristics of the involved participants, were explored and reported. The findings contribute to the fields of L2 pragmatic acquisition and study abroad by highlighting the gaps in the literature and identifying key learner variables that can have drastic influences on learners’ outcomes.", Journal Article,10.3390/languages9030096,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/role-learner-variables-pragmatic-development/docview/3003330927/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Gilquin, Gaëtanelle",2024,The Processing of Multiword Units by Learners of English: Evidence from Pause Placement in Writing Process Data,"Different methods and sources of information have been proposed in the literature to study the processing of language and, in particular, instances of formulaic language such as multiword units. This article explores the possibility of using pause placement in writing process data to determine the likelihood that a multiword unit is processed as a whole in the mind. The data are texts produced by learners of English and corresponding keylog files from the Process Corpus of English in Education (PROCEED). N-grams are selected on the basis of the finished texts and retrieved from the keylogging data. The pause placement patterns of these n-grams are coded and serve as a basis to compute the Pause Placement and Processing (PPP) score. This score relies on the assumption that n-grams which are delineated but not interrupted by pauses (hence taking the form of ‘bursts of writing’) are more likely to be processed holistically. The PPP score points to structurally complete n-grams such as in fact and first of all as being more likely to be processed holistically than structurally incomplete n-grams such as that we and to the . While the results are plausible and can be further substantiated by characteristics of specific n-grams, it is acknowledged that additional effects might also be at work to explain the results obtained.", Journal Article,10.3390/languages9020051,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/processing-multiword-units-learners-english/docview/2930956679/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Holsworth, Michael J.",2020,"The Effect of Extensive Reading, Timed Reading, and Word Recognition Training on Reading","Word recognition skill is fundamental for readers to successfully process any given text. Proficiency in the component skills of word recognition, orthographic, phonological, and semantic knowledge, is what readers need to accurately and automatically decode words to apply meaning to what they have read. For second language readers, the challenge of reading is often hindered by a lack of word recognition skills and therefore, they often suffer from low reading rates and consequently poor reading comprehension. This study was a quasi-experimental longitudinal inquiry into the effects of extensive reading, word recognition training, and timed reading on second language reading comprehension. Through word recognition tasks focused on orthographic, phonological, and semantic knowledge development, the aim of this study was to (a) better understand the effects of orthographic, phonological, and semantic skill training on word recognition skills, (b) better understand the effects of word recognition training on reading rate and reading comprehension, (c) understand the effects of long-term word recognition training on reading comprehension, (d) investigate if changes in word recognition components correlate with changes in reading comprehension, and (e) better understand reasons for expected and unexpected outcomes of participants in the study. A total of 248 participants took part in the study. The participants were a combination of first- and second-year economics majors from a private university in western Japan. They were from ten intact classes that were randomly assigned to one of four groups. The first group acted as a comparison group and focused on intensive reading training. The second group did extensive reading and included sustained silent reading. The third group did extensive reading and received word recognition training. The fourth group did extensive reading, word recognition training and timed reading training. All participants took a reading course as part of the required English program that lasted for two 15-week academic terms. The first 30 minutes of each class were used for each group’s respective training, and the remaining 60 minutes were used to teach general reading strategies. Quantitative data were gathered using a variety of instruments that included a lexical decision test, an antonym pairs test, a pronunciation test, a reading comprehension test, and a reading rate test. Additional qualitative data were gathered via selected participant interviews and a post-study survey. The results showed that the participants who received word recognition training in conjunction with extensive reading, produced positive changes in reading comprehension. However, only two of the components of word recognition ability improved with training, semantic knowledge and phonological knowledge. This indicated that more focus on specific components of word recognition might provide better scaffolding to foster reading development. The results also indicated that the three treatment groups all performed significantly better than the comparison group in reading rate gain and those improvements were reflected in reading comprehension gains. With respect to word recognition and its impact on reading comprehension, there was evidence showing that word recognition training did positively impact reading comprehension, but that more time might be required than used in this study to see its full impact. Finally, there were data to indicate that there was a correlation between semantic knowledge and reading comprehension. This study shows that although extensive reading is an effective approach to teaching L2 English reading, the addition of word recognition training and timed reading can benefit readers by improving reading comprehension. The addition of word recognition training can assist lower-proficiency readers to automatize low-level cognitive processes such as orthographic, semantic, and phonological processes, and by doing so, reallocate cognitive resources to higher-level cognitive processes such as inferencing and schemata activation required for reading comprehension. Finally, the addition of timed reading seems to have contributed to overall reading rate and reading fluency development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-extensive-reading-timed-word-recognition/docview/2444407111/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Marcet, Erika;Sasamoto, Ryoko",2023,Examining interlanguage pragmatics from a relevance-theoretic perspective: Challenges in L2 production,"This paper explores three pragmatic challenges that learners of Japanese as L2 encountered during their study abroad programs and work placements in Japan. These challenges are examined within the framework of Relevance Theory. Research on interlanguage pragmatics of L2 Japanese is limited in scope, as studies mostly focus on speech acts and other sociolinguistic and interactional strategies. As a result, researchers have yet to formally establish how learners of Japanese have difficulties in regard to their production of meaning. This study draws on open-ended questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions to determine the pragmatic competence of L2 students across two Irish universities. The study demonstrates that learners have difficulties with processing both linguistic encoding and phenomena that involve inference. That is, learners’ inability to activate their pragmatic competence hinders their ability to produce communicative acts. Findings lend support to the need to enhance pragmatic competence among L2 learners through specific cognitive processes. This paper also contributes to the need for interlanguage pragmatics to be pursued in conjunction with current developments in Relevance Theory. It is argued that ideas developed within Relevance Theory can be particularly beneficial to the teaching and learning of pragmatic competence in the L2 classroom.", Journal Article,10.1515/ip-2023-4003,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/examining-interlanguage-pragmatics-relevance/docview/2850472506/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

We conducted a picture-based elicited production experiment that compared subject and object RCs, varying the object animacy between animate and inanimate. The results from thirty learners showed more targetlike performance in subject RCs than in object RCs, both at group and individual levels, regardless of object animacy. Error analyses revealed that more object RCs were converted into subject RCs than vice versa. These results point toward a clear subject preference despite conflicted findings in previous research on RCs in Chinese as a foreign language. Animacy influenced subject and object RCs alike: both types were easier to produce when featuring an inanimate object. We suggested similarity-based interference or distribution-based effects to account for this finding.", Journal Article,10.1007/s10936-022-09865-9,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/subject-advantage-l1-english-learners-production/docview/2809964204/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Nelson, Christina",2023,Do a Learner’s L1 and L2 Change With Increasing L3 Exposure? Investigating Regressive Phonological Cross-linguistic Influence in Adolescent and Adult L3 Learners,"Arguably, from time to time every person who speaks more than one language experiences phenomena such as lexical access difficulties due to other languages, using another language’s syntax or applying phonological rules from another language. Such striking instances of cross-linguistic influence (CLI), the interaction of a speaker’s languages, are only the tip of the iceberg. As a plethora of studies over the last decades has consistently demonstrated, languages constantly interact and influence each other in the multilingual mind (Cenoz et al., 2001). Accordingly, rather than rigidly separated entities, a speaker’s languages are presumed to coexist within a complex and interconnected system (De Bot, 2012). The majority of previous studies has mainly focused on the progressive kind of CLI, i.e., from an earlier learned language onto a subsequent one (see, e.g., De Angelis, 2007, p. 20; Wunder, 2011, p. 107). However, CLI also occurs the other way around, namely from a later learned language onto an earlier one. In fact, we know from a solid body of attrition research that even a speaker’s first language (henceforth L1) is not as stable as once presumed. Language attrition is a well-documented phenomenon in the context of speakers who spend extended periods abroad and, as a result, experience changes or problems with their native language. Köpke and Schmid (2004) define attrition much more generally as a “non‐pathological decrease in a language that had previously been acquired by an individual” (p. 5). The vast majority of language attrition studies focus on immigrant contexts and only take L1 attrition into account, but several second language (henceforth L2; a further discussion of terminology ensues in the following chapter) phonology studies conducted in this line of thinking have suggested that the development of a new language system, even in low‐proficiency instructed learners, will impact the L1 phonology to some degree (Schmid &amp; Hopp, 2014, p. 371). These mostly temporary and subtle changes of a learner’s pronunciation in their L1 have been termed “gestural drift” (Sancier &amp; Fowler, 1997) or “phonetic drift” (C. B. Chang, 2012), and there seems to be a growing interest in this phenomenon. Naturally, there is even more potential for cross-linguistic interactions of this kind in the case of third language (henceforth L3) learners. These learners possess at least two already existing language subsystems which could be subject to changes triggered by the onset of learning a new language. When three or more languages are involved, the possibilities for intricate and diverse patterns of mutual interaction become considerably more complex. For instance, multilingual learners (i.e., those with three or more languages), compared to those learning only their first non-native language, can experience phenomena such as combined CLI. This occurs “when two or more languages interact with one another and concur in influencing the target language, or whenever one language influences another, and the already-influenced language in turn influences another language in the process of being acquired” (De Angelis, 2007, 49; for examples of this kind of CLI see, e.g., Blank &amp; Zimmer, 2009; Pyun, 2005). One of the important questions with regard to regressive influence in multilingual learners is what factors condition this form of CLI and which of a learner’s languages are more susceptible to it than others. In the few L3 studies conducted in this line of inquiry, the effect of language status is discussed frequently. Although their findings are somewhat mixed and exhibit much individual variation, there seems to be a tendency for more L3→L2 than L3→L1 influence (see Section 3.6.3). It should be noted, however, that these studies are rather exploratory and thus naturally limited in the number and population of speakers, learning contexts, and features under investigation. For instance, there is a dearth of knowledge concerning child and adolescent speakers at this point, despite the fact that age as a variable holds particular relevance when it comes to regressive CLI. In this connection, hypotheses about language status have been put forth suggesting that a person’s L1 may be more stable and thus less malleable or vulnerable than even a native-like L2 due to maturational constraints, i.e., as a result of age of learning (see Section 3.6.4 for a discussion of Cabrelli’s (2016) phonological permeability hypothesis). Age in this context is usually conceptualized as the binary differentiation of pre- versus post-pubescent, and its effect on CLI has only ever been assessed ‘retrospectively’ in adult speakers, for example by comparing mirrorimage groups of early and a late adult bilinguals at some point during the early stages of L3 learning (e.g., Cabrelli, 2016; Cabrelli &amp; Rothman, 2010). While such investigations are insightful with regard to other research questions (e.g., those of maturational constraints of language learning), they are more product-oriented in nature and therefore do not shed much light on how multilinguals of different age groups develop in their languages over time. What is more, due to the common onset of additional language learning (i.e., by learners who have already learned or are in the process of learning at least one language beside their L1) at around 11–13 years in the educational systems of many countries, there is a large number of L3 learners in instructed learning contexts that evade the dichotomy of pre- and post-pubescent learners, as they virtually fall in the middle of the two. This group has so far been majorly underrepresented in phonological L3 research in general (but see Kopečková, 2016; Kopečková et al., 2021; Llama &amp; López-Morelos, 2016; Nelson, 2020; Nelson et al., 2021).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/do-learner-s-l1-l2-change-with-increasing-l3/docview/3122643619/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Smith, Hye Young Choi",2023,Interactional Uses of Self-Talk in Korean,"This study explores the interactional uses of self-talk in Korean. “Self-talk” generally refers to speech directed to oneself. In a conventional sense, self-talk in public may be seen as violating social norms; however, in many interactional contexts, self-talk is not only acceptable, but contributes to mutual understanding between participants in the social encounter. Any competent member of a language community understands the underlying rules of how self-talk works, but little has been written about self-talk from interactional perspectives. In the Korean language, self-talk cannot be understood without considering linguistic features of self-talk utterances. While previous studies have identified and analyzed discourse functions of sentence enders that occur in Korean self-talk, the interactional uses of self-talk in Korean are underexplored. In order to gain a clearer picture of where, when, and how self-talk is used, this study investigates occurrences of self-talk in both private and interactional settings in data collected from reality TV shows, using conversation analytic and interactional linguistic methods. In this dataset, twenty-one different sentence enders used in self-talk (e.g., -ney, - (n)untey, -ta, -(u)nka/-na, -ci, -e/ayakeyssta, -kwuna, -e/ayaci) are observed. The analysis identifies several distinct actions carried out through self-talk, including dealing with new information, displaying stances or attitudes, talking through troubles, co-constructing future actions, managing knowledge or information, and constructing reported thought. The interactional uses of self-talk are explicated from two main theoretical perspectives, centering on participation frameworks and politeness. First, the use of self-talk can loosen up a participation framework: Self-talk places less imposition on hearers to take or respond to a turn, and less burden on speakers to choose or retain addressees while managing the complicated task of carrying on a multiparty conversation. Second, the use of self-talk helps Korean speakers&#xa0;negotiate politeness, which, in Korean, is intertwined with honorification and speech levels. The study considers how speakers manage the particular audienceship of self-talk within processes of politeness negotiation, and what drives the manipulation of speech styles and honorifics. Much remains to be explored regarding the social life of self-talk. This study highlights the pervasiveness of self-talk in our language life and calls for further exploration and discussion of self-talk from a variety of approaches.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interactional-uses-self-talk-korean/docview/2869397201/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Keppenne, Valerie",2023,"When Predictions Aren’t <em>Perfekt</em>: The Joint Roles of Prediction, Corrective Feedback, and Prediction Error in L2 Learning","In contexts of first language (L1) acquisition, prediction and adaptation are often viewed as fundamental to the learning process (Rabagliati et al., 2016). One mechanism that has been proposed to specifically account for such adaptive behavior is error-based implicit learning (e.g., Chang et al., 2006). According to this account, speakers constantly predict upcoming language input. When these predictions are not met, it leads to adjustments in the linguistic system in order to avoid future errors, i.e., speakers learn. To what extent similar mechanisms apply in L2 learning is uncertain, as the degree to which L2 learners have been shown to predict upcoming input is modulated by grammatical structure, proficiency, and other individual variables (for a review, see Kaan, 2014; Kaan &amp; Grüter, 2021). Generating fewer predictions means that opportunities for prediction error, and consequently for learning, may be compromised (Phillips &amp; Ehrenhofer, 2015). Despite this, there is evidence that learning from prediction error can occur, particularly when learners are forced to make predictions (Grüter et al., 2021). However, it is unclear whether error-based learning is possible when the target structure is novel to L2 learners, especially in lower-proficiency learners, as some baseline knowledge of the target structure may be necessary (McDonough &amp; Fulga, 2015; but see Bovolenta &amp; Marsden, 2022; Brod, 2021). Largely separate from frameworks of error-based learning, many studies investigating the differential effects of corrective feedback on L2 learning have shown that, like prediction, the effectiveness of corrective feedback can be modulated by factors such as the target structure and L2 proficiency (e.g., Ammar, 2008; Ammar &amp; Spada, 2006; Li, 2014). An understanding of how learners process feedback and compute prediction error may potentially explain why certain types of feedback are more beneficial than others, pointing towards the need to study error-based learning and corrective feedback in tandem to better understand the mechanisms underlying L2 learning. In two experiments, this dissertation unites classroom-based corrective feedback research and psycholinguistic research on predictive processing to study error-based learning in order to advance our understanding of the underlying learning mechanisms in late L2 acquisition. By encouraging learners to predict and by tracking their linguistic development, this dissertation sheds light on the role of prediction for L2 learning at different proficiencies, and how learners process feedback and use prediction errors to update their developing L2 linguistic system. Experiment 1 aimed to investigate the role of two different types of implicit feedback after prediction for the learning of German present perfect in learners of different proficiencies, since previous studies have shown both prediction and feedback effects to be modulated by target structure and learner proficiency. In German, the present perfect is formed with one of two auxiliary verbs: haben ‘to have’ is used with transitive verbs, such as essen ‘to eat’, while sein ‘to be’ is used with verbs that involve movement from A to B, such as laufen ‘to run’, or a change in state. The alternation thus has a semantic component that is difficult for L2 learners to acquire. The training task administered to participants created a context that encouraged them to engage in prediction in conjunction with receiving feedback to learn this alternation and the targeted past participles. In a pretest/posttest/delayed posttest design in a remote, web-based setup, L2 German learners ( N =46) of different proficiencies completed two training blocks in which they predicted a past action based on the auxiliary in a sentence fragment. For instance, they read Tina hat gestern Abend spät ___. ‘Tina has ___ late last night.’ and chose between two pictures that either matched or mismatched the fragment (based on the auxiliary). They then completed the sentence by typing the participle of the corresponding main verb, and received semantic- or form-focused feedback (regardless of response correctness). No explicit instruction was provided. Alongside the pre-,&#xa0;immediate, and delayed posttests, an interim test was administered between training blocks. These outcome measures included a written picture description task and a picture matching task to target production and comprehension of the present perfect. The results indicated that participants generally increased in auxiliary and participle accuracy over the course of the training, and that feedback ordering had little effect on accuracy or the trajectory of learning. The results also showed that learners of intermediate proficiency increased most in accuracy across testing times. On the other hand, analyses of auxiliary accuracy split by learners with and without prior knowledge of the target feature show that guessing — creating weak expectations based on no prior knowledge — paired with implicit feedback did not lead to significant learning. In Experiment 2, I expanded on the findings of Experiment 1 by investigating the developmental trajectory of whether and how learners predictively process the auxiliary online, how they process feedback, and how they compute prediction error online during learning. Beginning to intermediate L2 German learners ( N= 13) with previous exposure to the target structure completed a similar training task as in Experiment 1, including four training blocks with feedback. During the auditory presentation of sentence fragments during training, as well as during feedback presentation, participants’ eye movements and pupil dilation were recorded to track the emergence of predictive looks towards target pictures as well as the evolving processing of feedback and prediction error. Training was preceded by a pretest and followed by immediate and delayed posttests, including the same outcomes measures as in Experiment 1. The results showed that participants improved on productive measures of auxiliary and participle accuracy, but not on receptive measures of auxiliary accuracy, neither during training nor on the outcome measure targeting comprehension. Furthermore, the tracking of eye movements during training did not reveal the emergence of predictive looks to target images. On the other hand, the time course of the pupil response during feedback presentation did evolve over the course of the training task, and pupil responses differed depending on the correctness of learners’ predictions. Taken together, the results of these two experiments suggest that error-based learning is possible in L2 learning, albeit with some constraints related to the target linguistic feature, general L2 proficiency, and prior knowledge of the target feature. Furthermore, the importance of online predictive processing for learning in error-based learning frameworks is put into question, as learning occurred even in the absence of predictive looks during training. Finally, the usefulness of pupillometry to investigate feedback processing and its evolution over the course of a learning task is demonstrated. As such, this dissertation significantly contributes to investigations of L2 learning mechanisms and has a few pedagogical implications as well.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/when-predictions-aren-t-em-perfekt-joint-roles/docview/2866084383/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Xu, Jingjing",2023,The Role of Grounding and Lexical Aspect in L2 Acquisition of Perfective Aspect Marker <em>-Le</em> in Chinese,"Acquisition of the perfective marker -le in Mandarin Chinese is a daunting task for second language learners. To date, there has been no consensus on what it is about -le that makes it such a challenge to learners. This study investigates the acquisition of -le from both a lexical perspective and a discourse perspective. I test two hypotheses: (1) whether the distribution of - le in lexical aspectual class, i.e., state, activity, accomplishment, and achievement, plays a role in the way L2 learners use -le , as predicted by the Aspect Hypothesis; and (2) whether the distinction in discourse between foregrounding and backgrounding plays a role in the way L2 learners use -le , as predicted by the Discourse Hypothesis. Three proficiency levels of participants participated in an oral storytelling task: Frog, Where Are You , in Chinese. The results show that both the Aspect Hypothesis and the Discourse Hypothesis are supported. All of the participants used -le to distinguish foreground and background, and they also used -le predominately with achievements. Lower-level participants differ from higher - level speakers in that they produced much less -le with bounding materials in foreground with achievement predicates. It is concluded that the challenge of acquiring -le comes from the syntactic complexity of -le with bounding materials, rather than lexical aspect or grounding.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-grounding-lexical-aspect-l2-acquisition/docview/2842672330/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Dickerson, Sydney",2023,Second Language Discourse Marker Development: A Concept-Based Approach to Instruction,"This investigation examined the effectiveness of different types of explicit classroom instruction on second language (L2) development of the Spanish discourse marker (DM) pues. While several studies have addressed the positive effect of explicit instruction on L2 DM development, the current investigation moves beyond the explicit-implicit method debate by examining the comparative effectiveness of different types of explicit instruction, specifically by comparing the effects of concept-based instruction (CBI), rule-based instruction (RBI), and a control group (CTRL). This investigation contributes to the field of instructed pragmatics by demonstrating how different types of explicit instruction can affect the robustness of pragmatics learning outcomes. Furthermore, with the inclusion of CBI, this investigation expands theoretical paradigms for L2 pragmatics teaching to include a less explored framework for instruction — sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 1987). Given the learnability problem posed by the low perceptual salience and extensive multifunctionality of DMs, along with their conceptual connections to important interactional practices and to a semantic core that guides their use in discourse, DMs and pues specifically were identified as a potentially ideal candidate for development through CBI. Pues is translated in English to ‘so’, ‘then’, ‘cos’, and ‘well’ and is a highly frequent feature of Spanish conversation (Domínguez García, 2016; Stenström, 2006a; Stenström, 2006b). DMs like pues contribute to speakers’ ability to communicate effectively and participate in social interaction (Crible &amp; Pascual, 2020; Hayano, 2011; Hoshi, 2017; Thörle, 2016) and, thus, they are important linguistic features for L2 speakers. Using a pre, post, and delayed post design, data were collected using an oral decisionmaking task and a dialogue reflection task. The analyses addressed whether CBI, RBI, and CTRL produce the same effect on L2 Spanish learners’ pues frequency of use, pues functional range, and use of pues in interaction. As a secondary objective, the analyses also considered whether CBI and RBI produce the same effect on L2 Spanish learners’ ability to transfer learning to unlearned DMs. produce the same effect on L2 Spanish learners’ ability to transfer learning to unlearned DMs. Quantitative analyses, which addressed the learners’ ability to use pues frequently and for a range of functions, indicated an advantage for the CBI group, with CBI learners using pues with greater frequency of use and functional range than RBI and CTRL learners. The qualitative analysis, which addressed the learners’ ability to use pues in interaction, also indicated an advantage for the CBI group, with CBI learners using pues to express a stance of givenness towards utterances as well as to manage turn-taking in interaction. CBI learners’ use of pues for accomplishing these two interactional practices indicated a deeper understanding of pues and how the DM can be used to accomplish social actions in interaction. Overall, the findings provide support for the claim that CBI is superior to traditional explicit models of instruction (Erikson, Lanning, &amp; French, 2017) and suggest that the learnability problem of DMs may be lessened by providing a conceptual structure that presents learners with a framework for organizing DM multifunctionality and that also highlights the interactional importance of DMs as tools that can be used to accomplish social actions. The findings are discussed considering the role of conceptual knowledge in L2 DM development and implications for pragmatics instruction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-discourse-marker-development/docview/2838440281/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Tsujihara, Rie",2023,Expressing Gratitude in a Foreign Language: Concept-Based Language Instruction to Teach Thanking in L2 Japanese,"In the field of L2 pragmatics instruction, there have been calls to re-consider how L2 pragmatic competence is evaluated. L2 pragmatic competence consists of pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic knowledge. The former refers to the ability to use linguistic items to realize speech intentions, while the latter refers to the knowledge of the appropriate selection and usage of language in accordance with social conventions. L2 learners’ pragmatic competence is usually assessed based on L2 learners’ pragmalinguistic choices in comparison to native speaker data. In other words, L2 learners are expected to produce the target L2 pragmatic features in the same way as native speakers do. In reality, there are variations in native speakers’ pragmatic choices, and native speaker data do not capture the diversity of native speaker choices and pragmatic behavior. In the foreign language classroom, pragmatics materials are often developed based on the writer’s or teacher’s intuitions, and the full meaning of sociopragmatic information is not adequately provided. This may risk creating a sense of “this is how people behave in the target culture” and simply following native speaker norms without cultivating a way for L2 speakers to fully express themselves. Extensive reliance on native speaker norms also ignores L2 learners’ agency and personal pragmatic choices. Sometimes, L2 learners refuse to conform to L2 norms when the norms do not accord with their identities, beliefs, and personalities. Resisting L2 norms does not always mean a lack of L2 competence. Other times, L2 learners find a creative way to supplement the lack of their proficiency and make pragmatic choices different from the L2 norm. However, their L2 pragmatic competence is considered to be “problematic,” if they do not follow these norms. These learners may possess proper sociopragmatic knowledge but intentionally select different pragmalinguistic choices from L2 norms. Assessing L2 pragmatic competence based on native speaker norms risks overlooking L2 learners’ subtle development that is not related to native speaker norms.	 This dissertation explores a novel way to teach L2 pragmatics through concept-based language instruction (C-BLI), grounded in L.S. Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory of cognitive development. Vygotsky claimed that systematic and abstract knowledge, which he called scientific concepts, can be applied to a wide range of situations and raise the likelihood of successful task completion. Derived from Vygotsky’s claim, C-BLI aims to develop L2 learners’ pragmatic competence by first teaching scientific metapragmatic concepts and the meaning potential of language. Bringing language socialization theory into the C-BLI unit, the present study focuses on the speech act of thanking in Japanese and promoting the internalization of metapragmatic concepts. Through the analysis of various internalization tasks, the study examines (1) the development of learner production; (2) the development of sociopragmatic conceptual understanding; (3) the impact of language socialization opportunities; (4) the development of L2 learner agency; (5) the proper proficiency level for the C-BLI unit; and (6) the impact of language proficiency. The results show development in understanding scientific concepts of the target pragmatic feature and abilities to perform the target speech act. The development was promoted by various mediational means, including instructional materials and language socialization opportunities. I also found that the development of sociopragmatic knowledge provided L2 learners with tools to make pragmatic choices that achieve their communicative goals. Both third- and fourth-year learners benefitted from the C-BLI unit. Third-year learners benefitted more in concept development and less in the development of pragmalinguistic skills, while fourth-year learners benefitted in both sociopragmatic concept development and in their ability to use a range of thanking strategies and expressions in Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/expressing-gratitude-foreign-language-concept/docview/2838166367/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Dai, Dexin",2023,An Investigation in Acquiring Chinese Relative Clauses by Advanced Chinese L2 Learners,"The present study was focused on acquisition of Chinese relative clauses (RCs) by second language (L2) learners and whether this acquisition was influenced by RC linguistic features, learners’ Chinese proficiency levels, and their first language (L1). Data were gathered via a Chinese reading comprehension test, a grammaticality judgment task, a sentence combination task, a sentence formation task, and post-task interviews.&#xa0; An analysis of 46 Chinese learners’ and 22 native speakers’ performances on these tasks and 15 learners’ perspectives from the interviews revealed that the acquisition of RCs was challenging for learners, particularly with the use of the RC marker de . Furthermore, the types of RC and Chinese proficiency levels significantly impacted the learners’ acquisition of RCs. The results indicated that learners could comprehend both subject RCs (SRCs) and object RCs (ORCs) with comparable accuracy, but they produced more correct sentences with ORCs than with SRCs. Additionally, learners’ L1 influenced their acquisition of Chinese RCs, which was evident from the errors made with de as an RC marker and the production of Chinese RCs with English word order. The interview data confirmed that learners’ perceptions of Chinese RCs played a role in the L1 transfer effect on their acquisition. The results of the current study have implications for teaching Chinese RCs and suggest the need for frequent input on RCs in classroom instruction. Task-based language teaching activities and multimodal input can provide more meaningful and engaging input to learners and improve their accuracy and fluency in using RCs. Explicit instruction to explain the syntactic features of RCs to learners is also recommended. RC instruction should start with SRC and then proceed to ORC. Teachers are encouraged to communicate with students about their perceptions&#xa0;of the differences and similarities between RCs in their L1 and the target language to further analyze their errors and learning strategies.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigation-acquiring-chinese-relative-clauses/docview/2833521810/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Ji Young Kim,2023,Spanish–English Cross-Linguistic Influence on Heritage Bilinguals’ Production of Uptalk,"The present study examines the production of uptalk in Spanish and in English by Spanish heritage speakers in Southern California. Following the L2 Intonation Learning Theory, we propose that cross-linguistic influence in heritage bilinguals’ uptalk may occur along multiple dimensions of intonation. In this study, we examined the systemic dimension (i.e., presence of uptalk and presence of uptalk with IP-final deaccenting), the frequency dimension (i.e., frequency of uptalk and frequency of uptalk with IP-final deaccenting), and the realizational dimension (i.e., pitch excursion and rise duration) of heritage bilinguals’ uptalk. Our data showed that the three dimensions of intonation demonstrate varying degrees of cross-linguistic influence. The heritage bilinguals produced uptalk with IP-final deaccenting in both languages (i.e., systemic dimension), but produced it more in English than in Spanish (i.e., frequency dimension). That is, IP-final deaccenting emerges in heritage bilinguals’ uptalk in Spanish, but heritage bilinguals seem to recognize that this is an English feature that is not allowed in Spanish and try to suppress it as much as possible when producing uptalk in Spanish. However, in the realizational dimension, the heritage bilinguals demonstrated either phonetic assimilation to English (i.e., pitch excursion) or individual variability conditioned by language learning experience (i.e., rise duration). The asymmetry found across the dimensions suggests that, when bilinguals’ two languages are in competition for finite online resources, such as in the case of spontaneous speech production, phonological distinctions between L1 and L2 prosodic structures are kept, whereas phonetic differences that do not lead to any change in meaning are more prone to undergo cross-linguistic influence in order to reduce online processing cost. This study attempts to fill a gap in the literature on the cross-linguistic influence of intonation by bringing attention to heritage bilinguals. Heritage bilingualism introduces bilingual contexts that are often left unnoticed in traditional L2 acquisition scenarios (e.g., transfer from L2 to L1 intonation, asymmetry between order of acquisition and language dominance). Given that many aspects of cross-linguistic influence are shared across bilinguals, the investigation of heritage bilinguals’ intonation will contribute to building robust models of bilingual intonation.", Journal Article,10.3390/languages8010022,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/spanish-english-cross-linguistic-influence-on/docview/2791667408/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Kentmen, Hazel;Debreli, Emre;Mehmet Ali Yavuz",2023,Assessing Tertiary Turkish EFL Learners’ Pragmatic Competence Regarding Speech Acts and Conversational Implicatures,"Pragmatic competence is an indispensable component of communicative competence, which plays an essential role in human communication. When an individual is communicatively competent, he/she can carry out an effective conversation in social situations. Therefore, pragmatic competence establishes a compelling factor in English language learning as it permits second/foreign language learners to carry out successful conversations in real-life interactions outside the classroom atmosphere. The improvement of foreign language learners’ pragmatic competence will strengthen their communicative competence. The purpose of this paper is to assess foreign language learners’ comprehension of conversational implicatures by using a multiple-choice discourse test (MCDT) and their performance in a discourse completion test (DCT). Through the use of a quantitative analysis, 54 adult learners of English at C1 and B2 levels of proficiency defined by the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) in a university in Cyprus were tested on their use of implicatures and speech acts. EFL learners were more successful in the MCDT regarding the comprehension of formulaic and idiosyncratic features but received lower results in the DCT. As well as testing the proficiency level, this study was also designed to investigate the difference between the gender performances of the DCT and MCDT. The results revealed that there is no statistical significance between the male and female respondents in terms of pragmatic competence. Based on these results, the role of teaching pragmatics in EFL classrooms portrays a major aspect for a sustainable learning environment. Thus, the paper also illustrates suggestions for future research.", Journal Article,10.3390/su15043800,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/assessing-tertiary-turkish-efl-learners-pragmatic/docview/2779561966/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Findings showed that the participants chose to resist native Korean pragmatic norms in over 40% of their answers by either adhering to Chinese norms or diverging from both native Chinese and Korean norms. Their decision to resist native Korean pragmatic norms was affected by four main factors, namely the learners' personalities, multilingual identities, ongoing life histories, and relational affordances.

This study examines the complexity of word order scrambling in L3 Korean from cross-linguistic perspective, and investigates the influence of L2 learning experience in L3 acquisition by novice early bilingual learners (English-Chinese/Malay) in Singapore (n=148). An untimed grammaticality judgement task (GJT), which manipulates Case-assigning cues (e.g. word order, animacy and case-marking morphemes) for competition, was employed to investigate an impact of word order scrambling and item grammaticality. Given different cue hierarchy among involved languages, learners experience a challenge in unlearning LI reliance on word order and animacy cues in Case assignment and adjusting to the novel cue hierarchy of L3 Korean. Conflicting information between animacy cue and word order cue triggers negative judgment on the GJT regardless of the sentences' true grammaticality. Irrespective of typological proximity of L2, L2 learning experience is found to be facilitative in the acquisition of scrambled structure of L3, conditionally on ungrammatical sentences. We argue that these findings imply that general L2 learning experience benefits learners with control ability to effectively conform to a new cue hierarchy based on L3 exposure, and that such enhanced metalinguistic awareness is more visible when learners are handling tasks that require explicit knowledge.", Journal Article,10.17250/khisli.39..202209.001,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/beneficial-effect-multilingualism-resolving-l3/docview/2724916313/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Review 1 examines 56 instructional effect studies on the acquisition of L2 tense-aspect, and Review 2 examines 38 pedagogical proposals for the teaching of L2 tense-aspect. The reviews investigate to what extent instructional effect studies and pedagogical proposals with tense-aspect as the target of investigation and instruction (a) provide a linguistic description of the instructional target, (b) engage with previous research, (c) implement results from previous research to design assessment or instruction, and (d) include elaborate descriptions of teaching interventions and teaching materials.

"Rastelli, Stefano",2023,Telic for whom? The Lexical Underspecification Hypothesis,"The Aspect Hypothesis (AH) claims that L2 beginners use the perfective morpheme first with telic predicates (e.g., ‘arrive’, ‘build the house’) and only later with atelic ones (e.g., ‘know’, ‘work’). In contrast, the Lexical Underspecification Hypothesis (LUH) claims that beginners cannot represent the lexical aspect of L2 predicates (hence the telic vs. atelic distinction), because this distinction is a separate component of verb meaning. To investigate whether L2 learners distinguish between telic and atelic predicates, this study compares the responses from 299 L2 Italian learners (with different L1 backgrounds) and responses from 91 native speakers (NS) to the “ for / in + time span” adverbial test (Dowty 1979 ). The analysis shows that native speakers and L2 learners’ responses to the adverbial test diverge significantly, with learners’ proficiency and – to a lesser extent – L1 modulating their ratings. The results suggest that native speakers and beginning-intermediate L2 learners might not represent telicity alike, either because L2 aspectual competence is still developing or because beginning learners rely on the semantic representations of their L1. These findings support the predictions of the LUH and suggest caution when trying to assess learners’ aspectual representations.", Journal Article,10.1017/cnj.2023.3,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/telic-whom-lexical-underspecification-hypothesis/docview/2852154807/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Reaves, Alisha Jacqueline",2020,Discourse Markers in Second Language French,"In the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA), the acquisition of pragmatic competence has received far less attention that grammatical competence. Early focus on the acquisition of pragmatic competence has often centered on speech acts or conventional expressions. Discourse markers, also known as discourse particles, pragmatic particles and pragmatic markers, have received increasing attention over the last twenty years. These “little words”, are features of informal oral discourse and can contribute greatly to discourse cohesion and interlocutor interaction. Native speakers of French employ them extensively, and without them, discourse can seem stilted, unnatural or be difficult to follow. Despite their importance to communicative competence, they are largely ignored in the foreign language classroom and are generally presumed to be nearly un-acquirable without extensive immersion experience. And even with advanced language proficiency and extensive immersion experience, prior research has largely concluded that learners cannot or do not employ discourse markers like native speakers. This dissertation attempts to respond to this presumed limitation of foreign language (classroom) learners in examining the interlanguage of learners at three different proficiency levels. The 38 learners and 12 native speakers participated in an unstructured interview and completed three tasks: a narrative film retell, a film discussion and role-play scenarios, which were transcribed, coded and analyzed for their discourse marker use. The study identified discourse markers first by their function rather than from a predetermined list. The resulting inventory of discourse markers was then analyzed for frequency, variety and the range of functions expressed as learner proficiency increased. Results indicate that the frequency and variety of discourse markers produced does in general increase with proficiency. But interestingly, in concentrating on the functions expressed, we are able to observe shifts in discourse marker use for particular functions as the learner’s lexicon expands to include a wider range of discourse markers. Ultimately learners make extensive use of the discourse markers lexically available to them to perform a wide variety of functions. They then modify and expand these functions as more discourse markers are added to their lexicon.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/discourse-markers-second-language-french/docview/2444404090/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Suzumura, Nana",2020,The Usefulness of the Computer-Based Speaking Tasks of the AP Japanese Exam,"The Advanced Placement (AP) Japanese Language and Culture exam (the AP Japanese exam) is a large-scale high-stakes test targeting high school students in the United States. It is a computer-based test that consists of speaking, listening, reading, and writing sections. The present study focuses on the speaking section which aims to measure examinees’ interpersonal communication skills and presentational skills. The usefulness of the speaking tasks was investigated from a variety of perspectives. Drawing upon Bachman and Palmer’s (1996) model of test usefulness, the present study scrutinized reliability, construct validity, and authenticity of the AP Japanese speaking test tasks. In order to strengthen arguments regarding the usefulness of the AP Japanese speaking test tasks, the present study employed a mixed methods research design. The primary design was a concurrent design (R. B. Johnson &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Teddlie &amp; Tashakkori, 2006, 2009). The present study also employed a partial sequential design to integrate quantitative and qualitative methods at the analysis stage. Evidence for the usefulness of the test was collected by examining the speaking tasks used for the AP Japanese exam in the past, examinees’ language samples and test scores from the simulation of the AP Japanese exam, and examinee and rater survey responses. Four sets of conversation tasks and two sets of cultural perspective presentation tasks were selected from past test items and used in the simulation test. A total of 111 high school students, from two U.S. states, who were planning to take the AP Japanese exam participated in the present study. Their performance was rated by a total of six raters who participated in the present study: three raters for the conversation task and three raters for the presentation task. From the quantitative strand, generalizability theory and many-facet Rasch measurement (MFRM) (Linacre, 1989) were employed to analyze the test scores and to collect evidence primarily for reliability and construct validity. From the qualitative strand, discourse analysis was employed to analyze test task characteristics and examinees’ performance and to collect evidence primarily for authenticity and construct validity. The present study found that overall the AP Japanese speaking section has a reasonable level of usefulness in that it showed a reasonable level of reliability and it aims to represent more dimensions of speaking ability than other computer-based language tests. Yet it also has some issues related to construct validity and authenticity, especially for the conversation task. In particular, the present study recommends reviewing the amount of contextual information, the proportion of information-seeking prompts and non-information-seeking prompts, and the appropriateness of the conversation scoring criteria in relation to the nature of the conversation prompts. The present study illustrated how intricately different facets of test usefulness can interact. This study exemplified how useful a mixed methods approach can be in collecting more comprehensive evidence for test validation and how that in turn can allow for more meaningful and practical suggestions to improve the overall usefulness of a language test.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/usefulness-computer-based-speaking-tasks-ap/docview/2430176301/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Yelin, Boris",2018,Lexical Access and Cross-linguistic Influence in Trilingual Language Switching,"Recent psycholinguistic research has explored language switching in bilingual populations to understand how language is stored in the mind. Whereas the bilingual analysis has been useful, multilingual switching may provide more nuanced details about how the multilingual lexicon (vocabulary) is cognitively organized and how languages interact during speech. This dissertation examines the structure of the multilingual lexicon in two ways: (1) reaction time and carrier phrase duration measures are examined to provide evidence of trilingual lexical access when language switching in connected speech; (2) cross-linguistic influence in trilingual production is examined as evidence of the organization of the lexicon. The independent variable is language dominance. This dissertation is the first known study in which the L1, L2, and L3 are purposely varied for participants, which allows for generalizable results regardless of a specific language combination. It is also the first study to use a task that combines sentence reading in conjunction with cued picture naming, where the picture represented the object of the sentence to be produced. There were eleven sets of language triads (e.g. English, Russian, Spanish or English, French, Portuguese); within a triad, eight easily identified words with comparable mean frequencies in each language were chosen as object stimuli. Each stimulus contained a written carrier phrase in one of the participant’s three languages. The carrier phrase language was randomly selected, and it was followed by an object represented by a picture, which was to be named in the target language of the session (L1, L2, or L3). Stimuli were presented in conditions; a condition was a set of trials in which the target language of the language switch was always the same. Conditions were counterbalanced, with respect to order of acquisition, so that an equal number ( n = 7) of the total participants ( N = 42) followed each of the six potential orderings, e.g. L2, L3, L1 or L1, L3, L2, which was repeated for the total of nine conditions. In each condition, thirty-six stimuli were presented. All forty-two participants also completed a language profile questionnaire in order to gauge language dominance. Results from three mixed models (two for each of the reaction time analyses and one for the carrier phrase duration analysis), examining the main effects, support prior studies of lexical access investigating switch costs in which switching into a more dominant language exhibits a slower reaction time. Additionally, the results provide complementary approaches where latencies may be attributed to the predictability of a language switch. The cross-linguistic influence results partially corroborate past research in which more dominant languages were more easily suppressed, but do not strongly support the claim that more dominant languages cause less cross-linguistic influence. Rather data show that the L2 is both the most influential and most affected language, which supports the L2 Status Factor Model which states that the L2 has an intermediary position between one’s native language and other languages. Considered together, a more nuanced picture of the multilingual lexicon appears in which forces of inhibition and activation exist in an interplay to moderate lexical selection.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/lexical-access-cross-linguistic-influence/docview/2054017459/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Akiyama, Yuka",2018,Reciprocity in Online Social Interactions: Three Longitudinal Case Studies of a Video-Mediated Japanese-English e-Tandem Exchange,"Reciprocity is a key principle of eTandem, a telecollaborative arrangement where learners of different native languages meet online and use one language during half of the session and then do the same for the other language. While it has been argued that successful implementation of eTandem relies on this principle, the construct of reciprocity has not been operationalized beyond the traditional sense of ""equal time, effort, and interest"" (Brammerts, 1996). Thus, this study attempts to fill this gap by uncovering (1) what is reciprocity, and how it is enacted and accomplished, (2) what factors may mediate the enactment of reciprocity, and (3) what aspects of reciprocity seem more amenable to change than others. The context of this study was a semester-long, video-mediated eTandem project between U.S. learners of Japanese and Japanese learners of English who engaged in weekly interactions via Google Hangouts . After operationalizing reciprocity from second language acquisition (SLA), interactional sociolinguistics, and multimodal discourse analysis perspectives, I took a case study approach to examining the social interaction of three focal dyads who exhibited contrasting behaviors and perceptions about the project. The analysis showed that the participants enacted reciprocity beyond its traditional sense using both linguistic and non-linguistic resources. Specifically, the most successful dyad’s interaction was characterized by a collaborative interactional pattern, maximization of technological affordances, and various forms of situated reciprocity. Meanwhile, the least successful dyad’s interaction was characterized by a disproportionate conversational contribution by the U.S. participant and silences by the Japanese participant, mainly due to incompatible conversational styles (Tannen, 2005). Finally, the third dyad, who initially overemphasized the language-learning aspect of eTandem and struggled to establish comity (Aston, 1993), became one of the most successful and invested (Norton Peirce, 1995) dyads after resolving a ""critical incident"" that occurred when the U.S. participant came out as lesbian and both participants realized the importance of achieving intercultural understanding and fully exploiting each other’s bilingual resources. Based on these findings, I discuss what each form of reciprocity can reveal about participants’ social interaction and propose a new model for analyzing social interactions that take place in eTandem.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/reciprocity-online-social-interactions-three/docview/2030074138/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Taguchi, Naoko",2018,Contexts and pragmatics learning: Problems and opportunities of the study abroad research,"Despite different epistemologies and assumptions, all theories in second language (L2) acquisition emphasize the centrality of context in understanding L2 acquisition. Under the assumption that language emerges from use in context, the cognitivist approach focuses on distributions and properties of input to infer both learning objects and process of acquisition. The interactionist approach views context more narrowly by analyzing how a particular linguistic item is attended and processed during a task-based interaction, and how it becomes intake as learning outcomes. For socially-oriented theories such as the sociocultural theory and language socialization, learning is fundamentally situated in context. Through mediated participation in learning as social practice, learners come to appropriate linguistic knowledge. Context is also fundamental in the complex, dynamic systems theory, which views learning as a non-linear, adaptive process emerging through an interaction of resources and individuals within a given context. All of these theories give the central power to context to describe and explain L2 learning. Context serves as the site where acquisition is examined. Context also helps explain the process and outcomes of acquisition.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0261444815000440,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/contexts-pragmatics-learning-problems/docview/1976618318/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Ai, Haiyang",2017,Providing graduated corrective feedback in an intelligent computer-assisted language learning environment,"Corrective feedback (CF), a response to linguistic errors made by second language (L2) learners, has received extensive scholarly attention in second language acquisition. While much of the previous research in the field has focused on whether CF facilitates or impedes L2 development, few studies have examined the efficacy of gradually modifying the explicitness or specificity of CF as a function of a learner's response to the feedback. Yet, the type and extent of CF needed by a learner, as suggested by Vygotsky (1978), sheds light on whether a learner is developing his or her abilities in a particular area and the ways in which they do it. This paper reports on a study that explores the design, effectiveness and learners' perception toward a graduated (Aljaafreh &amp; Lantolf, 1994) approach to CF, i.e., feedback that progresses from very general and implicit to very specific and explicit, in an intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL) environment. The results show that the graduated approach to CF is effective in helping learners to self-identify and self-correct a number of grammatical issues, although an onsite tutor provides necessary remedies when the ICALL system occasionally fails to do its part. Implications for CF research, particularly on the notion of individualized feedback, are also discussed.", Journal Article,10.1017/S095834401700012X,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/providing-graduated-corrective-feedback/docview/1925766153/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

The present study aimed to discover the language features that can be learned by the Japanese language learners through critical viewing of anime in classroom. A course named ""Learning Japanese language through Anime"" was carried out in one public university in Malaysia for a duration of 10 weeks. Along with the administration of the course, the participants' worksheets on language analysis and learning diaries were collected. The findings showed that language used in anime is more casual in most of the contexts involving daily life. This language use is quite different from what the students usually listen to and use in the classroom where the educators heavily emphasis on the polite ways of speaking using the material designed specifically for pedagogical purposes such as textbooks. Although at times, the language presented in anime maybe even harsh or rough in an exaggerated way, rather than ignore this, it may be better to address it critically under the guidance of educator.", Journal Article,10.17507/jltr.0803.06,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/learning-japanese-through-anime/docview/1917334999/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Shoji, Shinichi;Dubinsky, Stanley;Almor, Amit",2017,"The Repeated Name Penalty, the Overt Pronoun Penalty, and Topic in Japanese","When reading sentences with an anaphoric reference to a subject antecedent, repeated-name anaphors result in slower reading times relative to pronouns (the Repeated Name Penalty: RNP), and overt pronouns are read slower than null pronouns (the Overt Pronoun Penalty: OPP). Because in most languages previously tested, the grammatical subject is typically also the discourse topic it remains unclear whether these effects reflect anaphors' subject-hood or their topic-hood. To address this question we conducted a self-paced reading experiment in Japanese, a language which morphologically marks both subjects and topics overtly. Our results show that both repeated-name topic-subject anaphors and repeated-name non-topic-subject anaphors exhibit the RNP and that both overt-pronoun topic-subject and overt-pronoun non-topic-subject anaphors show the OPP. However, a detailed examination of performance revealed an interaction between the anaphor topic marking, reference form, and the antecedent's grammatical status, indicating that the effect of the antecedent's grammatical status is strongest for null pronoun and repeated name subject anaphors and that the overt form most similar to null pronouns is the repeated name topic anaphor.

The reflexive zibun allows both local and long-distance (LD) binding interpretations. In a recent analysis, zibun is categorized into three types: zibun bound locally by a co-argument, zibun bound by an empathic LD antecedent, and zibun bound by a logophoric LD antecedent. An empathic antecedent is the participant in a sentence that the speaker most empathizes with, whereas, a logophoric antecedent is an individual “whose speech, thoughts, feelings, or general state of consciousness are reported” (Clements, 1975). Chinese also has a reflexive, ziji (self), that can be bound by an LD antecedent, like Japanese zibun . However, Chinese ziji is categorized into two (not three) types: locally bound ziji and ziji bound by a logophoric LD antecedent (Huang, Li &amp; Li, 2009). The goal of this study is to determine whether Chinese-speaking learners are able to distinguish the two different types of LD antecedent for zibun in Japanese. Twenty-eight Chinese-speaking learners of Japanese at advanced levels of proficiency and 36 native speakers of Japanese participated in the study. The results showed that Chinese learners were unable to distinguish between the two types of LD antecedents, showing a persistent presence of first language (L1) transfer.", Journal Article,10.22599/jesla.14,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/acquiring-antecedents-reflexives-when-both-l1-l2/docview/2451928763/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Kampittayakul, Tassanee",2017,Developing Thai Learners’ CIC through Translanguaging in One-on-One English Tutorial Sessions,"This article presents a conceptual paper, which proposes a concept of employing translanguaging as a pedagogical tool to promote the learners’ CIC – Classroom Interactional Competence, which lies at the heart of learning. The aim of the concept is to bridge two practices of monolingualism between Thai teachers who teach English through Thai only and native speakers who use English only. Translanguaging reflects reality in terms of using both languages to interact to improve the interactional competence of the learners. When both the teachers and the learners translanguage in the classroom, ‘translanguaging space’ is established. This means boundary lines of the two languages are blurred and become so permeable that the learners are able to step in the space and utilize it to make their own ‘space of learning’ through interactions with the teachers. This concept implies that the more the learners interact with the teachers, the more they learn English. Thus, if the learners’ CIC develops in translanguaging classroom context, it can be argued that translanguaging promotes Thai learners’ CIC, which is seen the same thing as the progress of learning. The paper introduces the concept, reviews literature on translanguaging and CIC, discusses conceptual framework, and proposes significant issues in conducting a future study.", Journal Article,,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/developing-thai-learners-cic-through/docview/2384113002/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Itani-Adams, Yuki;Iwasaki, Junko;Kawaguchi, Satomi",2017,Similarities and Differences between Simultaneous and Successive Bilingual Children: Acquisition of Japanese Morphology,"This paper compares the acquisition of Japanese morphology of two bilingual children who had different types of exposure to Japanese language in Australia: a simultaneous bilingual child who had exposure to both Japanese and English from birth, and a successive bilingual child who did not have regular exposure to Japanese until he was six years and three months old. The comparison is carried out using Processability Theory (PT) (Pienemann 1998, 2005) as a common framework, and the corpus for this study consists of the naturally spoken production of these two Australian children. The results show that both children went through the same developmental path in their acquisition of the Japanese morphological structures, indicating that the same processing mechanisms are at work for both types of language acquisition. However, the results indicate that there are some differences between the two children, including the rate of acquisition, and the kinds of verbal morphemes acquired. The results of this study add further insight to an ongoing debate in the field of bilingual language acquisition: whether simultaneous bilingual children develop their language like a first language or like a second language.", Journal Article,10.7575/aiac.ijalel.v.6n.7p.268,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/similarities-differences-between-simultaneous/docview/2188100043/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Kunisawa, Tae",2017,Thinking-for-Speaking and the EFL Mind: Face-to-Face Dialogue to Talk about Vertical Space,"Studies of thinking-for-speaking (Slobin, 1987) and of linguistic relativity (Gumperz &amp; Levinson, 1996) in multilinguals have been attracting more attention (Ortega, 2015). I propose the incorporation of sociocultural theory and linguistic relativity as a novel research approach in second language acquisition (SLA). Japanese learners of English go through a process in which word meaning develops from a single to binary semantic categorization as they learn to express vertical spatial operations in their second language (L2). Japanese has a nonobligatory distinction between contact and noncontact relationships when expressing vertical space (single semantic categorization), whereas English has an obligatory contrast (binary semantic categorization) (Munnich et al., 2001). The expression of vertical spatial relationships in Japanese and English is further influenced by language typology. Japanese, an SOV language, uses postpositions while English, an SVO language, uses prepositions. Vygotsky (1987) argues that verbal thinking (the internalization of speech) is tied with word meaning, and thus, as Japanese EFL high school students learn to express the obligatory contact-noncontact feature of vertical spatial configurations in English, moving from a single to a binary semantic categorization, verbal thinking will also develop. Vygotsky (1987) further claims that verbal thinking has sociocultural origins. In this dissertation, I investigate whether gesture can be instrumental in overcoming the constraints imposed by linguistic relativity. Vygotsky (1998) states, “Speech becomes the means for thinking mainly because it reflects an objectively occurring intellectual operation. This is a moment of major importance in the development of speech and thinking, which discloses the secret of the development of verbal thinking as a whole” (p. 114). I predict that a distinct worldview and the “development of cognitive processes” (Matyushkin, 1997b, p. 272) arise together when Japanese EFL students learn vertical spatial structure with the Gesture Listening Higher Concept Approach, which leads to “a qualitatively new mental formation that develops according to completely special laws and is subject to completely different patterns” (Vygotsky 1998, p. 34). The purpose of this study: (1) To pursue the new research path regarding incorporating linguistic relativity into SLA in sociocultural theory; (2) to explore whether the concurrent use of iconic co-speech co-thought gesture (ICSCTG) and listening practice can help Japanese high school students learn to express vertical spatial relationships in English more than they would learn from either treatment alone; (3) to investigate whether teaching ICSCTG and listening practice together will help Japanese EFL learners preserve knowledge of how to express vertical spatial relationships in English for a month after the intervention. I employed quantitative methods to accomplish the goals noted above. Results in this study suggest that the Gesture Listening Higher Concept Approach is an effective, evidence-based theoretical and pedagogical framework, which can facilitate L2 learning and conceptual change at the high school level. The effect of the Gesture Listening Higher Concept Approach on long-term foreign language learning would be a valuable avenue for future research. Slobin, D. I. (1987). Thinking for Speaking.

"Miyao, Mari",2017,"The processing of referential expressions in discourse by Chinese, English, and Japanese native speakers and by Chinese and Japanese learners of English","Referential expressions (REs), such as proper names and pronouns, pose challenges to second language learners (L2ers). Generally, adult native speakers prefer a more explicit RE form (e.g., a proper name) when referring to a less salient/accessible entity in the discourse and a reduced RE form (e.g., a pronoun) for a salient/accessible entity (e.g., Ariel, 1990). To use REs successfully, L2ers need to calculate the accessibility of discourse entities and associate them with particular RE forms. The present study asks how adult L2ers whose first language (L1) is Chinese or Japanese (null-subject languages) comprehend and produce REs in discourses in English (a non-null-subject language). Experiment 1 looks at the comprehension of REs in subject position (subject-REs), using closely-translated versions of a sentence-by-sentence self-paced reading task adapted from Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom (1993), by native speakers of English, Chinese, and Japanese. Experiment 2 examines the same participants’ production of subject-REs via a three-panel picture-narration task adapted from Arnold and Griffin (2007). Experiments 3 and 4 employ the English version of the two tasks to explore the comprehension and production of subject-REs by intermediate-to-advanced L1-Chinese and L1-Japanese L2ers of English. In the reading task, native English and native Japanese speakers preferred the most reduced subject-REs in their native language––respectively, overt-pronoun subjects and null-pronoun subjects––for accessible entities; native Japanese speakers strongly dispreferred overt-pronoun subjects. Different reading-time (i.e., raw vs. residual) analyses indicated different subject-RE preferences for native Chinese speakers, but they never dispreferred overt-pronoun subjects. In the production task, all three language groups preferred pronominal subject-REs for accessible entities, but when accessibility was reduced by the presence of another entity in the discourse, by gender congruence, or by a shifted discourse focus, they produced (more explicit) repeated-name subject-REs more frequently. Neither L2 group showed subject-RE preferences in reading, but in production, where pictures helped build firm discourse representations, they clearly preferred pronominal subjects for accessible entities and repeated-name subjects for less accessible entities. Overall, the present study suggests that when sufficient contextual support is provided, L2ers can calculate discourse accessibility and choose subject-RE forms according to the accessibility level (contra Sorace, 2011).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-referential-expressions-discourse/docview/2014467662/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Hoshi, Saori",2017,"'That movie was so hilarious <i>ne</i>!' the development of Japanese interactional particles <i>ne, yo,</i> and <i> yone</i> in L2 classroom instruction","The present study examines the development of L2 interactional competence (Hall, 1999; He &amp; Young, 1998) by JFL learners in an explicitly instructed setting as evidenced by their metapragmatic development and use of Japanese interactional particles ne, yo, and yone in unscripted conversations with NSs and peer learners. More specifically, the study aims to investigate the role of pragmatics-focused instruction in the learners’ ability to participate in a range of assessment activities (Goodwin &amp; Goodwin, 1992) using the particles ne, yo, and yone as resources to co-construct stance and achieve intersubjectivity (e.g., Du Bois &amp; Kärkkäinen, 2012; Kärkkäinen, 2006) between participants in an ongoing interaction. To bridge the gap between the paucity of instructional treatment and the highly frequent use of the interactional particles in mundane Japanese conversation, an instructional approach that incorporated awareness-raising and conversational activities was proposed and implemented in a third semester JFL course for one semester. In order to examine the effects of instruction on the development of interactional competence as evidenced by the learners’ use of particles ne, yo, and yone in the conversation sessions, the study focuses on the following perspectives: 1) learners’ metapragmatic understanding of the variability in particle function and in the meanings that the particles can index; 2) learners’ use of the particles in ways that are consistent with what they were taught, and that potentially extend beyond their instructed learning in terms of form, function, and activity-relevant participation; and 3) the learners’ demonstration of ability to deploy these particles as resources for joint stance taking in the conversations with NS partners and peer learners in linguistically and culturally appropriate ways. Findings from the experimental group learners’ performance from the pre- and post-tests provide evidence that they have demonstrated metalinguistic development of the discourse functions of the particles in the described discourse situations. The conversation data revealed that the learners’ development of interactional competence is evidenced by their increasing ability to attend to, and design their own talk in a way for it to be understood and responded to by the recipient (Pekarek Doehler &amp; Berger, 2016) through the use of the particles ne, yo, and yone for achieving joint construction of stance and intersubjectivity with their conversational partners. Moreover, the learners’ greater understanding and use of the particles through the instruction facilitate the emergence of learners’ agency, which provides the learners with an increased capacity to actively pick up linguistic affordances to develop their personal voice (Liddicoat &amp; Scarino, 2013) to interact more creatively and meaningfully with their conversational partners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/that-movie-was-so-hilarious-i-ne-development/docview/2014436157/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Sowers, Andrew Michael",2017,Loanwords in Context: Lexical Borrowing from English to Japanese and its Effects on Second-Language Vocabulary Acquisition,"Research has shown that cognates between Japanese and English have the potential to be a valuable learning tool (Daulton, 2008). Yet little is known on how Japanese learners of English produce cognates in context. Recently, studies have argued that cognates can cause a surprisingly high number of syntactic errors in sentence writing activities with Japanese learners (Rogers, Webb, &amp; Nakata, 2014; Masson, 2013). In the present study, I investigated how Japanese learners of English understood and used true cognates (words that have equivalent meanings in both languages) and non-true cognates (words where the Japanese meaning differs in various ways from their English source words). Via quasi-replication, I analyzed participants’ sentences to determine the interaction of true and non-true cognates on semantics and syntax. In an experimental study, twenty Japanese exchange students filled out a word knowledge scale of thirty target words (half true cognates and half non-true cognates) and wrote sentences for the words they indicated they knew. These sentences were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively for both semantic and syntactic errors. Sentences with true cognates were semantically accurate 86% of the time, while those with non-true cognates were accurate only 62.3% of the time, which was a statistically significant difference. When the sentences were analyzed for syntax, there was no statistically significant difference in the number of errors between true and non-true cognates, which contrasts with previous research. Qualitative analysis revealed that the most problematic syntactic issue across both cognate types was using collocations correctly. Among those collocational issues, there were clear differences in the types of errors between true and non-true cognates. True cognate target words were more likely to lead to problems with prepositional collocations, while non-true cognate target words were more likely to lead to problems with verb collocations. These results suggest that for intermediate Japanese learners of English, semantics of non-true cognates should be prioritized in learning, followed by syntax of true and non-true cognates, which should be taught according to the most problematic error types per cognate status.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/loanwords-context-lexical-borrowing-english/docview/2010531455/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

A sequential explanatory mixed-method study was implemented with two intact classes (18 CSE and 19 NCSE students). In the quantitative phase the 37 students' LA levels were measured through the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (Horwitz, Horwitz and Cope 1986) to analyse their relationship with their school speaking test scores, using bivariate correlation and stepwise linear regression analyses. Quantitative results revealed an inverse relationship between the students' LA levels and the test scores; the predictive power of course level and fear of negative evaluation in the test scores and the absence of an increase of LA as a function of the students' course level. In the qualitative phase, follow-up interviews were conducted with four subjects whose quantitative results had revealed a non-isomorphic pattern in the relationship between LA and the test scores (high/low, low/high). The qualitative results corroborated the significance of fear of negative evaluation and gave prominence to other factors.

"Baxter, Robert Patrick",2017,Co-constructing turns as interactional competence: Collaborative turn sequences in L1 and L2 Spanish,"Interactional competence is a theoretical construct that has only recently been tested empirically. Speakers contribute to an interaction with their individual resources; however, interactional competence is co-constructed by all participants. Interactional competence can be observed in spoken interaction as speakers’ combined ability to recognize and respond to expectations within a context (Young 2008, 2011). Collaborative turn sequences occur when an interlocutor who does not hold the floor pre-emptively contributes to an ongoing turn, eliciting an act of acknowledgement. Collaborative turn sequences have thus far been primarily examined in English, whereas use in first and second-language (L1 and L2) Spanish are relatively unexplored. This study thus characterizes and compares collaborative turn sequences in L1 and L2 Spanish. Sixteen native speakers of Spanish and 22 fourth-year learners completed Spanish and English conversation tasks, an experimental production task, and a judgment task. In Spanish conversation, NS-NS pairs employed prosodic, syntactic, and discursive cues for pre-emptive entry, continued the structure of ongoing turns, and acknowledged contributions with repetition. Learner-learner pairs displayed high and low-production patterns that differed in cues for pre-emptive entry and contiguity with the ongoing turn. High-production learners displayed a targetlike use of prosodic and syntactic cues (especially intonation), whereas whereas low-production learners hesitated with pauses, fillers, and restarts to such a degree that prosodic and syntactic cues lost their strategic value. High-production learners continued the structure of ongoing turns more often than low-production learners, and L2 acknowledgment overall favored affirmation over repetition. In experimentally-controlled attempts to collaborate with recordings, NS responses approximated response strategies observed in conversational data, whereas L2 responses demonstrated that all learners were at least capable of producing pre-emptive contributions. Experimental responses accentuated the nontargetlike nature of L2 pre-emptive entry, since learners often said “too much, too late” compared to native speakers. In the judgment task, native speakers considered authentic recordings of collaborative turn sequences to be appropriate, whereas learners from high and low-production groups judged sequences as both appropriate and inappropriate. Learners noticed collaborative and competitive aspects of collaborative turn sequences, and some learners even regarded “interruptions” (i.e. conversational overlap) in Spanish to be a normal practice.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/co-constructing-turns-as-interactional-competence/docview/1972137869/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Morris, Kimberly Jane",2017,Learning by Doing: The Affordances of Task-Based Pragmatics Instruction for Beginning L2 Spanish Learners Studying Abroad,"The study abroad (SA) context is often assumed to foster pragmatic development in a second language (L2), yet previous scholarship confirms that pragmatic norms are culturally-shaped and often remain imperceptible to uninstructed SA students (Bataller, 2010; Cohen &amp; Shively, 2007; Shively, 2010). Because pragmatics is not traditionally taught in language classrooms (Bardovi-Harlig, 2013), SA students are left to their own devices when interacting in the host community and performing face-threatening speech acts in their L2 such as requests and refusals, among others. Considering the importance of pragmatics for successful communication along with the predominance of short-term SA programs, it is crucial to support and accelerate students’ pragmatic development during immersion, especially beginners with limited linguistic and cultural knowledge. This study explores the affordances of explicitly teaching pragmatics to 12 students who studied beginning L2 Spanish in Spain for 10 weeks. A task-based instructional treatment (Long, 2015) was designed to raise students’ awareness of appropriate linguistic and cultural norms related to various speech acts, or meaningful “tasks” such as asking for directions and ordering a meal. Instruction was complemented with computer-mediated practice and weekly language exchanges with native speakers to further scaffold student learning. Following instruction, students carried out these tasks in the community and audio-recorded their interactions. To measure students’ development, data were collected through a pre/post Discourse Completion Test (DCT), pre-task audio-recordings conducted before instruction, naturalistic audio-recordings of task completion following instruction, self-reflections of task completion, interviews, and surveys. To corroborate the effectiveness of the instructional treatment, further pre/post DCT data were collected from two comparison groups of students studying beginning L2 Spanish, one abroad in Madrid and another at home in California. Analyses of the data confirmed the positive impact the instructional treatment had on students’ pragmatic development. The treatment group not only demonstrated statistically significant gains in pragmatic competence on the pre/post DCT measure, but they were also highly successful in applying their knowledge while completing the real-world tasks in the host community, as evidenced by comparisons of their pre-task and task completion recordings. Similarly, the students’ reflections of their own task completion showed increased awareness of the pragmatic features that were introduced in the instructional treatment, which likely explains why they demonstrated high retention of their pragmatic competence one full year after the program, as measured by a delayed post-DCT completed by eight of the 12 students. Moreover, the students who received the instructional treatment showed significantly higher gains in pragmatic competence when compared to the students in both comparison groups (abroad and at home) who did not receive the instruction. These results confirm the effectiveness of the task-based instructional model in accelerating beginning L2 students’ pragmatic competence while studying abroad. The findings from this study have the potential to not only inform the instructional design of study abroad programs, but also provide directors, teachers, and students with insights on how to maximize the study abroad experience. These findings could potentially change how and when pragmatics is taught both at home and abroad.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/learning-doing-affordances-task-based-pragmatics/docview/1970401508/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Van Booven, Christopher D.",2017,The Role of Context in the Development of Second Language Interactional Competence: A Comparative Microanalysis of Topic Initiation Practices in the Study Abroad Homestay and the Language Classroom,"This dissertation research aims to better specify the role of context in the development of second language interactional competence. Drawing on conversation-analytic methods and Wong and Waring’s (2010) model of interactional practices, I described and compared the opportunities that two study abroad contexts—the homestay and the language classroom—afforded one language learner to participate in one set of interactional practices—the initiation of new topic talk—throughout a semester-length study abroad program. Specifically, I sought to determine: (a) which methods the participants deployed to initiate new topic talk in each context; (b) which topic initiation methods were deployed exclusively by the learner, exclusively by the proficient speaker, or by both learner and proficient speaker in each context; and (c) how the participants sequentially organized each method of topic initiation in each context. The first set of analyses revealed that the participants made use of five distinct topic initiation methods and that all five methods appeared in both the homestay and the language classroom. The second set of analyses revealed that the affordances for participating as an initiator of new topic talk differed systematically by context, whereby the learner was observed to deploy a wider range of methods for initiating topic talk in the homestay as opposed to the language classroom. The third set of analyses revealed similarities and differences in the ways in which the participants organized topic initiation sequences across the two contexts. With respect to similarities, topic initiation methods appearing during casual pre-class talk interactional periods in the language classroom were often organized using the same basic sequences of turns that were observed in the homestay. Differences, meanwhile, included: (a) variations in sequential trajectories stemming from differences in participation frameworks (i.e., dyadic in the homestay vs. multiparty in the language classroom); (b) differences in the organization of methods between the homestay and pedagogically-oriented mid-class talk interactional periods; (c) differences in the range of topicalizable items; and (d) differences in the activities to which topic talk was directed. The observed differences in both the distributions and organization of topic initiation methods across the two contexts provide evidence that different learning contexts may afford learners differential opportunities for participating in second language interaction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-context-development-second-language/docview/1964286299/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Zamora, Celia Chomón",2017,The Secret is in the Processing: A Study of Levels of Explicit Computerized Feedback in Heritage and L2 Learners of Spanish,"The field of Instructed Second Language Acquisition (ISLA) has expressed interest in pursuing a research agenda that expands the current heritage language (HL) strand of research to investigate how this heterogeneous population re-learns their family language, and how this experience differs from that of second language (L2) learners. This dissertation examines an unexplored aspect of this strand - Depth of Processing (DOP) - and its potential role in the development of the Spanish pluperfect subjunctive in contrary to fact conditional sentences in the past, in both HL and L2 learner participant populations, and how it is facilitated by computerized feedback in more and less explicit conditions. The current study focused on four main issues: 1) it investigated how Spanish HL participants processed input in their heritage language, and how it was similar or different than L2 participants; 2) it examined how the Speaker profile and/or 3) Type of feedback (i.e. +Explicit feedback, -Explicit feedback, control) had an effect on subsequent performance on assessments; and 4) it addressed the potential correlation between levels of processing on performances following the experiment. Levels of processing were measured by means of think-aloud protocols collected during the experiment. Performance was examined by way of two written assessment tasks - a controlled production and a semi-spontaneous picture description task. Results showed that HL participants primarily employed non-metalinguistic strategies (e.g. grammatical judgment, prior knowledge) to process the input, whereas L2 participants relied more on metalinguistic strategies (e.g. mentions of previous lessons and explicit grammar). Additionally, although the HL participants significantly outperformed the L2 participants on both tasks at the immediate posttests, the significant difference was not maintained on the delayed posttest. Regarding the levels of explicitness of feedback, both the +EF and -EF groups significantly outperformed the control group on both tasks. At the same time, no significant difference was found between the +EF and –EF on both the immediate and delayed posttests. Finally, with respect to DOP, the +EF facilitated more instances of higher levels of processing than the –EF condition, and DOP was positively and significantly correlated with better performances at the delayed posttest.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/secret-is-processing-study-levels-explicit/docview/1949407696/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Kawamoto, Shota",2017,The Effect of Written Corrective Feedback on Cohesion In Japanese as a Foreign Language Learners' Writing,"Cohesion in second/foreign language writing has been studied from a theoretical standpoint since the late 1970s; however, little research has been conducted to investigate how cohesion can be improved. There is research that indicates that teacher feedback contributes to the improvement of cohesion in EFL leaners’ writing (Lee, 2002; Tangkiengsirisin, 2010); however, there is little empirical research examining the effect of teacher feedback on cohesive devices in learners of Japanese as a foreign language (JFL)’s writing, which calls for further research to delve into this issue. The present study investigated whether or not written corrective feedback (WCF) increases the number of cohesive devices in lower-level JFL learners’ writing. The subjects received one of the following WCF: direct feedback that explicitly corrects errors, indirect feedback that provides the location of errors with underlines and error codes, or no feedback on cohesive devices. They wrote four short expository essays (250 to 300 letters) about a different topic and revised them as their homework. The long-term effect was investigated by comparing a pre-test writing and a post-test writing 2, which was assigned after the treatment. In addition, the pre-test writing and a post-test writing 1, which was assigned a month later, were compared to investigate whether there were short-term effects. Furthermore, the extent to which the number of each type of cohesive device (reference, substitution, ellipsis, or conjunction) increased was examined. The results indicated that WCF did not have a statistically significant effect on the use of cohesive devices for either the short-term effect or the long-term effect; nevertheless, significant increases for referential and conjunctive cohesive devices within groups were found. In addition, it was found that more than 90% of the subjects in the direct WCF group and more than 60% in the coded group succeeded in revising their first drafts based on WCF, indicating that WCF was effective for them into editing their errors on cohesive devices.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-written-corrective-feedback-on-cohesion/docview/1947709070/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Hernández Morales, Ana Jessica",2017,Development in Pronunciation Accuracy Through Visual Feedback and Drills: Evidence From Stoprhotic Clusters in Learners of Spanish as L2,"Previous literature argues that native-like pronunciation is impossible in non-primary language acquisition related to the age of L2 onset (Scovel, 1988; Long, 1990). Studies provide evidence that different types of instruction have a positive effect on L2 learners’ productions (i.e., Derwing, Munro &amp; Wiebe, 1998; González-Bueno &amp; Quintana-Lara, 2011) and L2 learners may achieve native-like mastery of the target language phonetic features (Bongaerts, 1995). Some studies provide evidence that drills are effective for producing more native-like speech (Paulston, 1970; Yoshida &amp; Fukada, 2014). Other studies provide evidence that visualization of the speech contours has a significant effect on improving suprasegmentals (i.e., Chun, 1989; James, 1979) and segmentals (i.e., Motohashi-Saigo &amp; Hardison, 2009). For stop rhotic clusters (SRC), Spanish and English differ in: short vs. long lag stop voicing; rhotic manner (tap vs. retroflex), and epenthesis (presence vs. absence). Studies suggest that L2 learners may achieve native-like mastery of target language phonetic properties of SRC (Colantoni &amp; Steele, 2006) but no known studies have compared the use of a visual feedback paradigm (VFP), Drills, and traditional instruction in their production. Three groups of native English speaker learners of Spanish recorded a pre-test, 3 trainings and post-test throughout one semester. The visual feedback group and drills group performed a visual and auditory discrimination task respectively, comparing their productions with those of NSS. The control group performed cultural activities. Target tokens, containing SRCs, were embedded in novel phrases and carrier sentences. While both trainings were equally effective for the durational parameters of the plosive and the rhotic segment, the other two features (rhotic manner and epenthesis) showed more resistance to be mastered. Results show that the acquisition of SRC seems to follow a difficulty acquisition hierarchy, but there is a strong co-dependence between the rhotic manner and the presence of an epenthetic vowel.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-pronunciation-accuracy-through-visual/docview/1947708487/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Fernández Arroyo, Laura",2017,L2 Spanish Verbal Morphology Mastery Sequence,"Although there is agreement on the existence of a sequence in the acquisition of a second language (L2), it is still controversial how such a sequence would proceed. Different theories for different languages have been proposed. A popular proposal is that first lexical and later morphological aspects are acquired, and within the later, first the regular ones, and then the irregular ones. In this study, departing from the proposals of Hopp’s, Skehan, Pienemann,and Connectionism, as well as some previous results by Presson et Al. (2013), some of their theories’ predictions with respect to the acquisition sequence of indicative preterit and present tenses in Spanish as L2 by native speakers of English were tested. In order to do so, 61 students of 3 different levels were given a test where they had to conjugate these two tenses for regular, irregular, and paronymous verbs. Response accuracy was measured for each of the 1,098 experimental items. In addition, for the second year level, students were divided into a training and a control group, and the effects of training were measured with a second test. The training method used was the Focus on Form type of instruction. Results indicate that, for accuracy, with respect to tenses, present is mastered before preterit is (present already in the first year, while preterit only gets mastered in the third year). Likewise, irregular verbs are harder to master, particularly in the preterit, although differences were not consistently significant through the advancement in level. Paronymous verbs did not show a different mastering timing than that of the regular verbs. As for the training, the results for the training group were not very significantly different from those of the control group, contrary to previous studies’ results, indicating that more training might be necessary, although the timing should still occur in the second year for the preterit. Thus, and although more studies are needed still in the area, it seems that there is a sequence in the acquisition of Spanish L2 morphology, so that present is mastered significantly earlier than preterit, and regular verbs are mastered also earlier than irregular ones, despite the higher frequency of irregular verbs.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-spanish-verbal-morphology-mastery-sequence/docview/1934125621/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Muhammad, Ananda Astrini",2017,Creation and Evaluation of Multimedia Materials to Promote Development of Current and Prospective International Students' Pragmatic Competence in Academic Settings,"Literature on communicative language ability has identified pragmatic competence as a crucial aspect of second language (L2) communicative language ability. However, current literature has employed varied definitions of pragmatic competence, and little effort has been made to synthesize pragmatics studies in order to come up with a comprehensive list of components that comprise pragmatic competence. This effort was recently undertaken by Laughlin, Wain, and Schmidgall (2015), who conducted a systematic literature review of many different models, principles, and theories of pragmatics. The result was a construct of pragmatic competence which included five components, namely sociocultural knowledge, pragmatic-functional knowledge, grammatical knowledge, discourse knowledge, and strategic knowledge. In addition to proposing a more comprehensive construct of pragmatic competence, Laughlin et al. (2015) also suggested an operationalization of the construct through the use of multimedia materials. The present study aims to operationalize this construct by designing, producing, and evaluating multimedia materials to teach pragmatics, particularly making requests in spoken and written communication within U.S. academic settings. More specifically, this research work investigates: (1) how participants perceive the effectiveness of the multimedia materials and accompanying tasks for developing their pragmatic competence; and (2) how participants’ performance differs between pre-instruction and post-instruction assessments. The creation of the multimedia materials was guided by multimedia design principles proposed by Mayer (2009) and Chapelle’s (2001) Computer Assisted Language Learning task appropriateness framework. Two groups of participants, namely current U.S. international students and prospective international students, participated in the study. Both groups used and evaluated the multimedia materials hosted on an online learning platform. Data were collected from participants’ responses to feedback questionnaires, and their self-evaluation and self-reflection reports as well as their performance on pre-instruction and post-instruction assessments. Findings suggest that overall, participants’ learning experience was positive: they perceived gains specifically in their sociocultural, pragmatic-functional, and grammatical knowledge. However, certain limitations to the multimedia materials were also commented on by the participants, including the audio quality and length of the videos. Additionally, a comparison of participants’ performance in the pre-instruction and post-instruction assessments in Unit 1 seemed to suggest that most of the participants were able to successfully use the knowledge of request strategies and politeness features that they obtained from the instructional materials. This is indicated by their shift from using speaker-oriented strategies that are more direct in the pre-instruction assessment to using hearer-oriented strategies that are more indirect in the post-instruction assessments. Additionally, participants’ use of request strategies and politeness features were more varied after instruction.

"Xiao, Feng",2017,Development in the use of Chinese mitigation in interaction,"This study investigated changes in the use of mitigation and face negotiation in interaction in two advanced-level Chinese learners over eight weeks in China. Data included video-recordings of semi-structured interviews between the learners and a Chinese native speaker as well as their stimulated recalls with the recorded interviews. Sequential analysis of their use of mitigation showed that, at the beginning of their study abroad (SA), the learners used the [dànshì /kěshì] (‘but’) clause but did not use the four mitigation forms identified as common sentential mitigation devices in Chinese corpora (reduplication of verbs, verb+[yīxià], the sentence final particle [ba], and [a]/[ya]). Eight weeks later, they started using the sentence final particle [ba], but not the other three common sentential mitigation forms. At the discourse level, they used single pre- and post-expansions at the beginning of SA; eight weeks later, they started using multiple pre- and post-expansions. The stimulated recall data revealed that the learners’ use of mitigation in both the pre- and post-interviews was based on their face (i.e., pubic self-image) consideration in interaction.", Journal Article,10.1515/caslar-2017-0003,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/development-use-chinese-mitigation-interaction/docview/1913421786/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Maimone, Luciane L.",2017,"The Role of Crosslinguistic Influence From L2 Spanish, Type of Linguistic Item, and Aptitude in the Learning Stages of L3 Portuguese Forms: An Exploratory Study","This study investigates facilitative and non-facilitative crosslinguistic influence (CLI) from second language (L2) Spanish in third language (L3) Portuguese learning by native English speakers, testing some of the hypotheses of L3 acquisition models. To assess CLI effects on the intake and learning of Portuguese forms by novice Portuguese learners, the performance of L2 Spanish speakers was compared to that of non-Spanish speaking learners. The study also addresses the question of how CLI affects the intake and learning of lexical versus morphosyntactic items. While this study does not pinpoint the exact mechanisms affected by CLI during input processing, it approaches CLI from a cognitive perspective, going beyond the simple verification of transfer and looking at prior knowledge as a cognitive factor in interaction with the analytical components of aptitude, operationalized as grammatical sensitivity and grammar inferencing. It also looks at how CLI affects different learning stages, following Leow's (2015a) model of the L2 learning process in ISLA. Participants underwent laboratory learning conditions and were assessed at three points in time. Results confirmed non-facilitative CLI from Spanish in the recognition and production of lexical items and irregular past participles, and positive CLI from Spanish in the recognition and production of regular past participles, partially supporting the Typological Proximity Model (TPM) (Rothman, 2010) and the Scalpel Model (Slabakova, 2016). Results also showed that CLI affected different learning stages similarly, and that differential performance on lexical versus morphosyntactic items was mediated by verb morphology and prior language knowledge. Aptitude only correlated positively with overall accuracy and agreement in the production of regular verb forms, with no mitigating effects on negative CLI.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-crosslinguistic-influence-l2-spanish-type/docview/1901490664/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Zhang, Dongbo;Yang, Xuexue",2016,Chinese L2 Learners' Depth of Vocabulary Knowledge and Its Role in Reading Comprehension,"Using a Chinese Word Associates Test (WAT-C), this study examined the vocabulary depth of second language learners of Chinese and its contribution to the learners' reading comprehension. Results showed no significant effects of word frequency, word class (i.e., adjectives vs. verbs), and type of association relationships (i.e., paradigmatic vs. syntagmatic) on learners' WAT-C performance. More important, vocabulary depth was found to be a significant and unique predictor of reading comprehension over and above vocabulary size. On the other hand, the relative contributions of vocabulary depth and size depended on what types of texts were read and what comprehension skills were assessed. Specifically, for the long passage comprehension task with questions testing literal comprehension, vocabulary size was a more important predictor, whereas for the short passage comprehension task with questions testing inferencing, vocabulary depth was a more important predictor. These findings were discussed in light of the different levels of lexical complexity between the short and long passages and the different cognitive processing demands the questions of the two comprehension tasks placed on learners.", Journal Article,10.Un/flan.12225,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/chinese-l2-learners-depth-vocabulary-knowledge/docview/1855295266/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Taguchi, Naoko;Gomez-Laich, Maria Pia;Arrufat-Marques, Maria-Jose",2016,Comprehension of Indirect Meaning in Spanish as a Foreign Language,"This study investigated comprehension of indirect meaning among learners of L2 Spanish via an original computer-delivered multimedia listening test. The comprehension of implied speaker intention is a type of indirect communication that involves the ability to understand implied intention by using linguistic knowledge, contextual cues, and the assumption of relevance (Taguchi, 2005, 2011). Since inferential processing involves parallel processing of all available signals, both linguistic and nonlinguistic, to interpret the indirect utterance (Sperber &amp; Wilson, 1995), it is essential to incorporate multimedia input. By creating a multimedia comprehension test in Spanish, the study examined theoretical claims about inferential mechanisms and their applicability to L2 comprehension. Thirty-two L2 Spanish learners in intermediate/ advanced Spanish classes at a private U.S. university and 21 native Spanish speakers completed a listening test that assessed comprehension of three types of indirect meaning: indirect refusals, indirect opinions, and irony. These item types differed in terms of the degree of conventionality encoded and the extent of inferencing required for comprehension. Participants' comprehension was analyzed for accuracy and comprehension speed. Results revealed a significant difference in L2 Spanish learners' comprehension accuracy scores and response times across the three item types. Irony was the most difficult to comprehend for L2 Spanish learners. Conventionality did not facilitate comprehension because indirect refusals and opinions had the same accuracy scores. In terms of response times, indirect opinions were faster to comprehend than indirect refusals and irony items. Posthoc retrospective verbal interviews revealed that learners used a wide a range of verbal, nonverbal, and contextual cues to make inferences of indirect meaning.", Journal Article,10.Un/flan.12230,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/comprehension-indirect-meaning-spanish-as-foreign/docview/1855294464/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Li, Shaofeng",2016,The construct validity of language aptitude,"A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the construct validity of language aptitude by synthesizing the existing research that has been accumulated over the past five decades. The study aimed to provide a thorough understanding of the construct by aggregating the data reported in the primary research on its correlations with other individual difference variables and with second language (L2) achievement. A total of 66 studies were retrieved that contributed effect sizes based on 109 unique samples and 13,035 foreign language learners. The results revealed that (1) aptitude was independent of other cognitive and affective factors: it was distinct from motivation, had a negative correlation with anxiety, and overlapped with, but was distinguishable from, intelligence; (2) executive working memory was more strongly associated with aptitude and aptitude components than phonological short-term memory; (3) aptitude measured using full-length tests was a strong predictor of general L2 proficiency, but it had low predictive validity for vocabulary learning and L2 writing; and (4) different aptitude components demonstrated differential predictive validity for different aspects of learning. The findings are useful for tackling a number of conundrums surrounding language aptitude and shed light on how to reconceptualize the construct and reorient the research.", Journal Article,10.1017/S027226311500042X,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/construct-validity-language-aptitude/docview/1838033458/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Martin, Alexandra",2018,"How to Synchronize? A Study of Video-Based, Voice-Based & Text Based Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication, Working Memory, and Second Language Learning","The growing presence of Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication (SCMC), defined as ‘real-time, synchronous conversation that takes place online’ (Baralt &amp; Leow, 2016, p. 200), via video-chat programs such as Skype in online language courses has been documented in the literature (Ziegler, 2016c). While research up to now has shown that text -based SCMC impacts positively on second language (L2) learning, the effects of video - and voice -based SCMC still need to undergo a formal investigation as a means for effective L2 instruction. On the other hand, the role of working memory capacity (WMC) in the SCMC mode has begun to be explored in previous research but only for text-based SCMC, whereas oral SCMC has yet to be addressed. Using a controlled experimental design, the current dissertation helps fill these gaps in the literature by investigating the potential of these three SCMC modes (text-based, voice-based, and video-based) to promote L2 Spanish grammatical learning. Additionally, it addresses whether WMC mediates the effects of mode for L2 learning. Sixty-five intermediate L2 Spanish learners completed an interactive task in one of these three environments that targeted the learning of Spanish past subjunctive, a complex structure thought to be difficult to learn for L2 learners of Spanish (e.g., Collentine, 2010). Grammatical learning was assessed via pre-, post, and delayed posttest of written and oral production. Results from a series of several repeated-measures ANOVAS, ANCOVAS, and correlational analyses indicate that participants in the three SCMC modes learned the past subjunctive and many retained that learning one week after the treatment, and that this learning was not significantly different across groups. No effects were observed for WMC, indicating that participants across the WMC spectrum successfully achieved grammatical learning under the given explicit experimental conditions. Finally, participants in the text-based group took a significantly longer time to complete the task than the other two groups, although they needed significantly fewer feedback episodes than participants in the voice-based group to achieve similar rates of learning. These findings point to the importance of designing theoretically motivated learning tasks that can promote meaningful interaction in written and oral SCMC environments for L2 grammatical learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/how-synchronize-study-video-based-voice-amp-text/docview/2093905623/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Menjo, Shigehito",2018,The Development of L2 Prosody in Japanese Speakers of English: A Quasi-Longitudinal Study,"In this dissertation, I present the development of English prosody use in production and perception tasks by native Japanese speakers of English (JPs). Previous studies have shown that prosody is a crucial component in verbal interactions (Pickering, 2001) and affects comprehensibility, fluency, and accentedness (Kang, O., 2010; Trofimovich &amp; Baker, 2006). However, a smaller number of studies has been conducted in understanding the development of English prosody use by JPs over time and what factors may affect the development of their production and perception of prosodic features. Considering this gap, I examined English prosody manipulation by JPs over time using a mixed quasi-longitudinal research design with the emphasis on quantitative analysis. The participants included 31 native speakers of English (NSs) as a control group (Male = 8, Female = 23) and 93 JPs with 3 different proficiency levels (Male = 41, Female = 52) that were based on their length of residence in the United States with age of arrival held consistent. The participants completed 2 production tasks and 1 perception task. For the production tasks, 2 data-eliciting techniques were used: a read–aloud protocol and a spontaneous speech. For the perception task, the Profiling Elements of Prosody in Speech- Communication (PEPS-C; Peppé &amp; McCann, 2003) software was used. The production data sets were analyzed auditorily and instrumentally, and pause measurements, rate measurements, stress measurements, and intonation (Kang, O., &amp; Pickering, 2011) were examined. The data sets of both the production and perception tasks were statistically analyzed. The results of statistical analyses for the production tasks indicated that a combination of prominence characteristics strongly discriminated between the speaker groups. The results also showed that the production of tone, rate, and stress measures were other significant factors that discriminated between the speaker groups. The results for the perception task showed that none of the JPs met the NSs in perceiving interpersonal and informationally marked intonation patterns. In conclusion, the overall results indicated that length of residence partially accounts for the development of a second language (L2) prosody performance and that socially constructed prosodic cues should be taught explicitly in the classroom. They also indicated that more attention should be given to perception in L2 prosody acquisition as Flege (1995) claimed that accurate perception leads to accurate production.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-l2-prosody-japanese-speakers-english/docview/2103180418/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Alzahrani, Fahad Ali",2018,Pragmatic Developmental Pathways by Saudi Learners of English During Study Abroad,"Recently, it has become increasingly popular among Saudi students to study abroad. There are, for example, currently 58,726 Saudi students studying at the university level in the United States. During their study abroad (SA) journey, when they wish to say something to someone, they need to determine the situationally-appropriate utterances: What can be said, to whom, where, when, and how. From the interlanguage pragmatic (ILP) perspective, the SA context is assumed to provide more opportunities to communicate with native speakers, and these opportunities are believed to lead to pragmatic gains (Kinginger, 2008, 2009). Guided by five research questions, this study investigated the development of pragmatic competence among Saudi second language (L2) learners of English during their SA experiences in the United States. The main areas of investigation in this study are: 1) assessing three aspects of pragmatic competence ––pragmatic appropriateness judgment “perception”, production, and comprehension with a focus on the speech acts of request, refusal and apology as well as implicature and 2) exploring the pragmatic developmental pathways of how their pragmatic competence develops while studying abroad in the United States. The study utilized an explanatory sequential mixed method design, with a quantitative phase followed by a qualitative phase. Seventy Saudi L2 students completed three pragmatic measures, namely, multiple-choice-discourse completion test (MDCT), written completion test (WDCT), and implicature listening test (ILT) that were administered electronically through a software for gathering data called Qualtrics . This was followed by semi-structured interviews with a sample of eight students who participated in the quantitative phase of the research. Several major findings were uncovered. In phase one, findings revealed that Saudi L2 learners were relatively competent in identifying, producing, and understanding appropriate language in contexts. Interview data suggested that there is a need to have a broader focus in language learning, including, beside grammar structure and vocabulary accuracy, the considerations of speech appropriateness and the different cultural issues. The interview data also discussed the participants’ acquisitional and developmental pathways of pragmatic competence as well as the sources they utilized to gain and develop their pragmatic competence in the SA context. Finally, the study concluded that almost all participants perceived SA in the native country to be helpful for developing pragmatic skills.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/pragmatic-developmental-pathways-saudi-learners/docview/2114885751/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Hauk, Bryn",2020,Deixis and Reference Tracking in Tsova-Tush,"This dissertation takes an in-depth look at deixis and reference tracking in Tsova-Tush, a Northeast Caucasian language spoken in the Republic of Georgia. First, I establish basic patterns of argument structure, complementation, and question formation using available corpora. I identify an unusual type of subordination that combines properties of complement and relative clauses, and I outline patterns of apparent long-distance agreement and long-distance reflexivization. Together, these descriptions characterize the structure of simple clauses through complex sentences in Tsova-Tush. Building off these insights, I undertake an investigation of deixis in embedded contexts, typically established within complement clauses. I show that Tsova-Tush has a restricted type of indexical shift, in which all context parameters shift together under verbs of speech, while indexically shifted clauses retain the ability to form semantic dependencies. Beyond indexical shift, I detail other types of embedded perspectives, including quotation and perspective-taking under perception verbs, and I use corpus methods to describe the function of quotatives and discourse markers. Finally, I explore reference tracking in thirteen narratives. I identify an indefinite marker for first mentions of animate referents and discuss the use of demonstrative adjectives as markers of definiteness at subsequent mentions. Conditions for covert reference, including activation status and syntactic position, are described. Argument dropping is found to be preferred when reference is continuous across clauses and when the referent serves as the subject of a transitive verb. Further, in contrast to some other languages, I show that gender in Tsova-Tush is a poor strategy for reference tracking, but that shifted attitudes assist in maintaining the activation and prominence of the attitude holder. This examination of narratives further contributes a description of several additional discourse-level features, including tail-head linkage. Altogether, this dissertation provides a detailed examination of patterns in Tsova-Tush syntax, semantics, and discourse relevant to the study of deixis and reference tracking. I show that Tsova-Tush exhibits syntactic phenomena found in other Caucasian languages, such as indexical shift and long-distance agreement. Further, I find that one purpose of shifted indexicals is to aid in reference tracking, while gender agreement can fail to exhibit this function.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/deixis-reference-tracking-tsova-tush/docview/2428561000/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Hwang, Haerim",2020,"A Contrast Between Vp-Ellipsis and Gapping in English: L1 Acquisition, L2 Acquisition, and L2 Processing","This dissertation probes the L1 acquisition, L2 acquisition, and L2 processing of contrasts between two seemingly similar phenomena in English. The first, VP-Ellipsis (VPE), involves the deletion of an entire verb phrase (e.g., Sara made pizza and Kelly did [e] too ); the second, Gapping, involves a verb gap (e.g., Sara made pizza and Kelly [e] pasta). One such contrast is that whereas VPE is grammatical both in conjunct clauses and in adjunct clauses (e.g., Sara made pizza {and Kelly did too/because Kelly did} ), Gapping is grammatical only in conjunct clauses (e.g., Sara made pizza {and Kelly pasta/*because Kelly pasta }). Another contrast is that whereas Gapping (e.g., Mom hugged the boy at home and Dad in the park ) allows the noun phrase following the conjunction to be interpreted as either the subject (e.g., ‘hugger’) or object (e.g., ‘huggee’) of the gapped verb, VPE (e.g., Mom hugged the boy at home and Dad did too ) permits only a subject reading. Importantly, these grammaticality and interpretation contrasts constitute learnability challenges for L1-English children and L1-Korean L2ers of English alike: For neither group can input alone lead to implicit knowledge of the impossibility of both Gapping in adjunct clauses and the object reading for VPE; for L1-Korean L2ers, moreover, implicit knowledge that VPE in adjunct clauses is possible and that the object reading for VPE is impossible cannot come from their L1 grammar or from their classroom instruction, either. Study 1 is a corpus-based study examining how (in)frequent VPE and Gapping are in the input to L1-English children and the input to L1-Korean L2ers of English. The input corpora to each of these groups revealed hardly any instances of VPE in adjunct clauses or of Gapping at all, which suggests that input alone cannot derive the two contrasts at issue. Two acquisition studies tested L1-English children ( n = 24–33) and (early, n = 27; late, n = 30) L1-Korean L2ers of English for knowledge of these contrasts between VPE and Gapping: the grammaticality contrast via an acceptability judgment task (Study 2) and the interpretation contrast via a picture-sentence matching task (Study 3). The results showed that (a) the L1 children know the grammaticality contrast as early as age 5;11 and the interpretation contrast as early as age 5;6, and (b) the higher-proficiency early L2ers and most of the late L2ers had also acquired both contrasts. Processing of Gapping vs. VPE by adult L1-Korean L2ers ( n = 48) was investigated in Study 4 via a self-paced reading task making use of the fact that (im)plausibility is manipulable in Gapping, but not in VPE, by changing the verb (e.g., Bill {ordered/*drank} coffee and Jane sandwiches vs. Bill {ordered/drank} coffee and Jane did too ). Like the native speaker controls ( n = 53), the adult L2ers exhibited implausibility effects only for Gapping, thereby indicating that they can retrieve verb information at the gap site in real-time processing. In short, the acquisition studies provide evidence that L1 children and L1-Korean L2ers can overcome the learnability problems involved in the grammaticality and interpretation contrasts between VPE and Gapping in English, and the self-paced reading study demonstrates that adult L1-Korean L2ers can process English Gapping sentences in a target-like manner.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/contrast-between-vp-ellipsis-gapping-english-l1/docview/2428556967/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Rothgerber, John Robert",2020,The Influence of Native Language Phonotactics on Second Language Lexical Representation in Japanese Learners of English,"Previous studies on segmental contrasts have suggested that learners may store the sounds of second language (L2) words in their mental lexicons in a way that is influenced by the first language (L1) phonological system. However, it remains unclear what influence L1 phonotactic constraints have on L2 lexical representations. Phonotactic constraints are language-specific constraints on how sounds can be arranged and sequenced. In Japanese, for example, two consonants cannot occur together in the syllable onset. Therefore, the English word group is adapted into Japanese as [ɡuɾuːpu], with an epenthetic vowel inserted into the consonant cluster. Research has shown that L1 Japanese learners tend to perceive an epenthetic vowel [u] in English consonant clusters, despite no vowel being present. It is therefore possible that they also encode this epenthetic vowel in the mental lexicon. The current study addressed this possibility by using a lexical decision task with Japanese learners of English. Nonword stimuli were created by inserting epenthetic vowels into real English words (e.g., [ɡuɹuːp] from group [ɡɹuːp]). Words were varied according to their loanword status in Japanese and to the cluster-initial consonant. The results showed that learners tended to accept such nonwords as real words, and intermediate learners showed higher rates of acceptance than advanced learners. No effects were found for loanword status or consonant type. The results of the lexical decision task correlated strongly with the results of an oddity discrimination task, which is a measure of perception. These findings provide evidence that learners lexically encode epenthetic vowels. This, in turn, suggests that L1 phonotactic constraints influence L2 lexical representations. As learners advance in proficiency, they tend to become more accurate in both perception and lexical representation, although further research is needed to tease apart the relationship between the two.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/influence-native-language-phonotactics-on-second/docview/2425859886/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Vallejos, Cristi",2020,"Fluency, Working Memory, and Second Language Proficiency in Multicompetent Writers","The present study compared pausing behavior while writing in the L1 and the L2 of emergent bilinguals and investigated the role of WM and proficiency level, as well as observed the cognitive processes that occurred during these pauses using a mixed-methods approach. Learners from a 5th semester ( N = 17), 7 th semester ( N = 16), and graduating seniors ( N = 14) produced argumentative tasks in their L1 and L2 and all writing behavior was recorded using Inputlog (Leijten &amp; Van Waes, 2013), a keystroke logging program designed specifically for writing studies. Pause frequency and length was compared within and across languages and regressions were run to test the effects of the different components of WM on pausing behavior in the L1 and L2. Proficiency level was also included for the L2. Stimulated recalls were collected for a subset of participants ( N = 5) and these were coded according to Kellogg’s (1996) model of writing to compare cognitive behavior. Results show that in both languages pause length increased by constituent level but that all pauses were longer in Spanish than English. The relationship of WM and pauses was different for each language, in English visual spatial WM was related to pause frequency between sentences while the updating function was related to pause length between words and pause length and frequency between sentences in Spanish. Proficiency level was found to have the most effects on pauses, with those at higher proficiency levels pausing less frequently between words and sentences and pausing for shorter periods of time. Stimulated recall comments showed that participants did engage in the cognitive processes described by Kellogg (1996) in both languages, however there were qualitative differences. Processes related to formulation were the most prevalent in both languages, but there were more behaviors related to planning in English and translation was the most frequent behavior in Spanish. Some differences were also seen by proficiency level, those with a lower proficiency level did not show evidence of monitoring in Spanish while those with a higher proficiency level did.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/fluency-working-memory-second-language/docview/2414708854/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Guerra, Kathleen Sigrid",2020,Contact-Induced Request Softening in Northern Andean Spanish: Linguistic Ideologies in Perception and Practice,"This investigation explores the origins, perception and use of the northern Andean Spanish (CAE) dialectal construction dar + gerund, most often classified as a manner to convey a polite request or favor. It forms part of a handful of similar construction that combine a non-standard auxiliary verb (such as dar “give”, mandar “send”, pasar “pass”) with a gerund and an optional clitic, i.e. dame explicando (“give me explaining”). These variations are not found in standard or other varieties of Spanish, and historically correspond to pragmatic and syntactic transfer from Ecuadorian Kichwa (Haboud, 1998, 2003; Lipski, 2013; Muysken, 2005). 	While previous studies (Niño-Murcia, 1995; Hurley, 1995a, 1995b; Haboud 1998, 2003; Lipski, 2013; Olbertz, 2002, 2008) have investigated the origins and varieties of dar +gerund in bilingual and monolingual CAE speakers, few (Carvajal, 2016; García, forthcoming; Haboud &amp; Palacios, 2017) have addressed pragmatic constraints and use. Therefore, the first paper in this investigation reviews relevant literature on the origins and uses of dar + gerund and other non-standard auxiliaries as evidence of grammaticalization and complexification the context of language contact. This sets the backdrop in the second and third papers for the examination of how dar + gerund is perceived as a defining feature of the CAE speech community in computer mediated discourse (CMC) and in the context of personal, transactional and professional relationships. 	By examining the perception of appropriate use, this investigation shows how dialectal constructions (and language in general) encode a range of social meaning. In addition, it demonstrates how a simple definition of politeness is insufficient to describe appropriate pragmatic performance in the context of a request. Instead, appropriate request performance is derived from a complex interpretation of relationship type, context and social distance.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/contact-induced-request-softening-northern-andean/docview/2413009267/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Goss, Seth",2020,Exploring variation in nonnative Japanese learners’ perception of lexical pitch accent: The roles of processing resources and learning context,"This article reports findings on the effects of processing resources and learning context on the perceptual learning of lexical pitch accent in beginning nonnative Japanese learners. Native English speakers in at-home and study-abroad contexts were tested twice during a semester of Japanese study on their ability to judge the correctness of and categorize nouns by their pitch pattern. Regression analyses indicated that the ability to store nonnative-like sound sequences in phonological short-term memory (PSTM), as well as auditory processing ability, predicted a significant degree of perceptual gains made over a 12-week interval. However, these predictors were task specific in that PSTM capacity predicted correctness judgment gains, while auditory processing accounted for variation in categorization. Furthermore, despite learners in the at-home context performing slightly better overall, processing resources adhered to the same predictive pattern when context was taken into account. The results suggest that (a) neither increased input during study-abroad nor targeted instruction is sufficient for most learners to acquire lexical accent; (b) processing resources support the acquisition of lexical prosody, but these may depend on how learning is assessed; and (c) PSTM operates across learning contexts, suggesting it to be a domain-general capacity in early-stage nonnative language acquisition.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0142716419000377,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/exploring-variation-nonnative-japanese-learners/docview/2342975396/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Kaku-MacDonald, Keiko;Liceras, Juana M;Kazanina, Nina",2020,Acquisition of aspect in L2: The computation of event completion by Japanese learners of English,"Previous studies on the acquisition of semantics in the aspectual domain have suggested that a difficult case for achieving a targetlike representation in a second language arises when learners need to preempt a first language (L1) option (Gabriele, 2009). This study investigates this issue by focusing on a learning scenario where predicate-level variability exists in the L1 input. We investigate whether Japanese learners of English can learn to invalidate event cancellation readings (Tsujimura, 2003) in English and how such knowledge develops with increasing English proficiency. We address these questions by examining how Japanese learners of English interpret accomplishment predicates that allow an event cancellation reading in Japanese but not in English. A truth-value judgment task was administered to 60 beginner, 96 intermediate, and 40 advanced Japanese learners of English as well as 20 L1 English and 20 L1 Japanese speakers. Our results showed that Japanese learners of English progressed toward a targetlike representation of aspectual entailment.

The outcomes demonstrated students' exhibition was factually huge from the pretest to the posttest in the ETR and ITR groups, however not in the NTR group. Besides, the analysis of contrasts over the groups in the posttest uncovered the predominance of the ETR over the ITR and NTR groups.

We test the hypothesis that a listener’s discrimination of and sensitivity ( d’ ) to Japanese pitch accent reflects how pitch cues inform all words a listener knows in an additive, nonselective manner rather than how pitch cues inform words in a selective, Japanese-only manner. Six groups of listeners performed a speeded ABX discrimination task in Japanese. Groups were defined by their L1, L2, and L3 experience with the target language’s pitch cues (Japanese), a language with less informative pitch cues (English), or a language with more informative pitch cues (Mandarin Chinese). Results indicate that sensitivity to pitch is better modeled as a function of pitch’s informativeness across all languages a listener speaks. These findings support cue-centric views of perception and transfer, demonstrate potential advantageous transfer of tonal-L1/L2 speakers, and highlight the cumulative role that pitch plays in language learning.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0272263119000068,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/second-third-language-learners-sensitivity/docview/2293674630/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Kawaguchi, Satomi",2019,Acquiring Yes/No Questions in Japanese as a Second Language: A Cross-Sectional Study,"This cross-sectional study investigates the acquisition of yes/no questions in Japanese as a second language (L2) based on the Prominence Hypothesis from Bettoni and Di Biase in 2015 within the Processability Theory from Pienemann in 1998, and Pienemann, Di Biase, and Kawaguchi in 2005 as the theoretical framework. Speech data were collected from twenty university Japanese L2 learners in Australia, ranging from beginner to super-advanced levels, utilizing naturalistic conversation and a “spot the differences task” to elicit question sentences. The learners’ speech was transcribed and their use of yes/no questions was analyzed based on the Prominence Hypothesis. Question particles (e.g., ka? ne? deshoo?) used by the learners were also analyzed. The results indicated that the acquisition of yes/no questions in Japanese L2 generally followed the developmental stages defined by the Prominence Hypothesis. However, ‘prosody only’ (i.e., use of rising intonation), which is hypothesized as the first L2 question construction after single word questions, was not used by the L2 Japanese learners. Instead the learners used sentence-final question particles from the beginning to indicate the interrogative mood. Also, as the learners’ developmental stages progressed, they became able to utilize a wider variety of question particles. These findings are important both theoretically and practically in learning and teaching Japanese L2. This study provides empirical evidence supporting the Prominence Hypothesis in a typologically head-last, subject-object-verb (SOV) language.", Journal Article,10.18848/2327-7882/CGP/v17i02/13-34,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/acquiring-yes-no-questions-japanese-as-second/docview/2713034266/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

This study aims to determine if the pragmatic and grammatical awareness relates to motivation and severity rating, and if the pragmatic and grammatical awareness are correlated to one another. The subjects were 81 first-year English-major Thai students at Naresuan University. These students learned English within a foreign language (EFL) context. Two sets of analyses were carried out; one for each type of awareness being investigated. The first set, with the dependent factor being grammatical awareness, used the following independent factors: five types of motivation (ideal L2 self, ought-to L2 self, L2 learning experience, intended effort, L2 anxiety), the severity rating of the grammatical inappropriateness and the pragmatic awareness. The independent factors of the second set were similar to the first, except that the severity rating of the grammatical inappropriateness and the pragmatic awareness were changed into the severity rating of the pragmatic inappropriateness and the grammatical awareness, and the dependent factor was pragmatic awareness. The findings showed that the severity rating of the grammatical inappropriateness was the only factor that was significantly correlated to the grammatical awareness, and the severity rating of the pragmatic inappropriateness was the only factor that was significantly related to the pragmatic awareness. These findings suggest that L2 learners’ perception of the seriousness of the grammatical and pragmatic mistakes has a greater bearing on grammatical and pragmatic awareness than motivation or the other awareness factors.", Journal Article,,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/do-pragmatic-awareness-grammatical-relate/docview/2384112071/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Imai, Junko",2019,L2 Learning-to-Write through Writing Conferences: A Mixed Methods Research Study,"A writing conference (WrC) is a one-on-one consulting session concerning a student’s written academic work that takes place in a novice–expert pair. The literature on second language (L2) WrCs commonly addresses issues such as how novice writers learn to write, writers’ communicative responsibilities, and the challenges involved in L2 WrCs (e.g., Cumming &amp; So, 1996; Ewert, 2009; Patthey-Chavez &amp; Ferris, 1997; Young &amp; Miller, 2004). L2 writing research has identified conditions that lead to successful textual revisions by coding texts, while conference studies have illustrated dominance and miscommunication in WrC talk by analyzing discursive practices. Yet these approaches are rarely employed together to understand data from the same participants and contexts, and most studies have been conducted on a small scale. To understand the effectiveness, meaningfulness, and challenges of L2 WrCs, I introduced WrCs in a college-level English for Academic Purpose (EAP) program in Hawai‘i. Employing a sequential explanatory mixed-methods research design (Creswell, 2009), I collected pre and post questionnaires and essays from 108 learners. Over the course of the semester, 33 student–tutor pairs met for WrCs outside of regular EAP class times. I video recorded the WrCs, collected the students’ drafts and revisions, and conducted playback interviews with each participant. I statistically compared the quality of the students’ texts and attitudes, coded the topics discussed, discourse structures, and revision types, and explored the participants’ performances qualitatively. While the findings of the quantitative analysis indicate marginal effectiveness of L2 WrCs, the coding analysis demonstrates the diversity of the participants’ engagement in the WrCs. Qualitative analysis of selected WrCs illustrates the active participation and scaffolding that occurred in individual sessions, shows the interactive structure of the WrCs, and validates quantitative and coding results. Finally, the study explores the convergence and divergence of the findings from the different analyses, allowing a mixed-methods interpretation that casts new light on WrCs and L2 learning-to-write. Pedagogically, this study addresses the following matters: (a) whether WrCs are useful, (b) whether L2 learners should attend WrCs, (c) what learners and their tutors discuss during WrCs, and (d) how learners and tutors participate in WrCs.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-learning-write-through-writing-conferences/docview/2379033484/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Length of formal study, although it may relate to language proficiency indirectly, has been a rather neglected aspect in pragmatic acquisition research. This study analyses the effects of length of time spent learning English formally on English language learners' ability to evaluate impoliteness and the foundations by which they evaluate it. Empirical data were collected by means of questionnaires and a semi-structured interview from one hundred EFL teacher trainees at a private university in Central Java Indonesia. The participants were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 50) studied English for nine and half years and group 2 (n = 50) studied English for eight and half years. The overall results revealed that the length of time spent learning English affected the learners' capability of comprehending impoliteness in particular off-record impoliteness.

"Tobaru, Hiromi",2019,Style Shifting and Social Network Development during Education Abroad Programs in Japan,"This dissertation explores ways that home institutions—educational institutions that send their students to affiliated universities—can provide pedagogical support to maximize the learning experience of U.S. undergraduate students during yearlong education abroad (EdA) programs in Japan. The results of this dissertation suggest several features that are key to pre-EdA training. The most crucial is repeated experiential practice on inter-personal negotiations toward co-constructing a meaningful Third Space (Jian &amp; Walker, 2017) that entails raising sensitivity to style-shifting strategies. Group, rather than individualized, format better maximizes the opportunities for negotiation. Also useful would be opportunities to hear the experience of students who have just returned from a yearlong EdA in Japan, focusing on their experience (or lack) of network building. The need for repeated practice entails that training occurs over a duration of time, such as a semester. The first phase of this research examined difficulties in building intercultural relationships that American students and local Japanese students experience in a short-term EdA program in Japan. Data collected through interviews and observation suggest that the two groups have gaps in their expectations about speech style when interacting with each other. In particular, U.S. students struggled in shifting their speech from formal to casual. Based on these findings a pre-departure training regimen was devised for students participating in a yearlong EdA program in Japan. The training focused on style-shifting skills to develop a relationship-building persona in a Japanese college setting. The second phase of the study investigated the outcomes and process of learning in yearlong EdA exchange programs. Of the seven undergraduate students who participated in this phase of the study, four went through the pre-EdA training, while the other three chose not to. Two proficiency tests and a microanalysis of their discourse in terms of style shifting during proficiency interviews were used to assess the outcomes of all participants’ EdA gain. The process of their EdA learning was examined by analyzing their language use logs and interviews about social network development. The effectiveness of the EdA training was measured by comparing the findings of the two groups, i.e. the EdA training group and the non-EdA training group. Findings suggested that the EdA training did not have a great impact on the participants’ outcome of EdA learning as measured by the proficiency tests. However, a closer examination of the learning process revealed that those participants who faced and endeavored to overcome challenges in building their social networks with locals demonstrated more EdA gain than those who did not. These students had to negotiate relationships continuously with interlocutors from the host community. Repeated negotiation experiences may have facilitated these EdA students’ learning of how to communicate effectively in Third Spaces. In the current study, such social ties are called negotiated Third Space . The findings also suggested that the structure of EdA programs at host universities (e.g., roles and culture of dorms, school events, language programs, etc.) had the greatest impact on constructing negotiated Third Spaces. In order to maximize EdA learning in Japan, it is crucial to support EdA students’ negotiation skills. EdA students can utilize style shifting as a communication strategy to recognize, negotiate, and co-construct expectations with locals. Such skills also help EdA students develop a relationship-building persona, which enables them to forge intercultural relationships with locals, which in turn maximizes their EdA learning in Japan. In addition, understanding each EdA program from the students’ perspectives is also crucial to maximize EdA learning in general. Home institutions should use the returnees as a resource for those who will participate in the same EdA program.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/style-shifting-social-network-development-during/docview/2320962890/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Bistline-Bonilla, Christine",2020,"Interaction in Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication: The Effects of Interlocutor, Task, and State Anxiety","There is an increasingly large body of research that has addressed how interaction via Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication (SCMC) may support second language (L2) development (see Ziegler, 2016 for a review). Various empirical studies in SCMC have demonstrated that type of interlocutor (e.g., Liu, 2017) and type of task (e.g., Blake, 2000; Yilmaz &amp; Granena, 2010) can significantly impact the amount of negotiation that occurs during interaction. Nevertheless, the number of empirical studies is limited and they vary widely in their methodology. In addition, other researchers have suggested that one of the possible advantages of SCMC over other modes of communication is its potential to reduce L2 learner anxiety (e.g., Abrams, 2003). 	The present study aims to contribute to instructed second language acquisition (ISLA) research by employing two types of tasks along with three types of interlocutors in SCMC to address whether 1) production of language-related episodes (LREs) on task, 2) amount of talk on task, and 3) L2 lexical recognition and production scores over time are related to type of interlocutor, type of task, and learners’ state anxiety. It included 82 adult intermediate L2 learners of Spanish who collaborated with either a peer, professor, or native speaker via Zoom instant messaging to complete 1) an information gap task and 2) a decision-making task. After completing each experimental task, they completed a state anxiety questionnaire adapted from Baralt and Gurzynski-Weiss (2011). 	Statistical analyses revealed that a combination of Type of interlocutor and Type of task differentially affected the production of LREs and the amount of talk on task. In terms of participants’ lexical recognition and production performance over time, the analyses indicated that while Type of interlocutor played a limited role, participants were significantly more accurate in their recognition and written production of the decision-making task target items. It was also found that interlocutor type and task type were not predictors of participants’ overall state anxiety. Ultimately, these findings provide a better understanding of the roles of interlocutor status and the type of task in text-based SCMC and their impact on subsequent recognition and written production of L2 lexical forms.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interaction-synchronous-computer-mediated/docview/2443656789/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Chen, Yunchuan",2019,The Acquisition of Japanese Relative Clauses by L1 Chinese Learners,"This dissertation focuses on L1 Chinese learners’ acquisition of Japanese relative clauses (RCs), as it provides an ideal testing ground for two important questions of L2 acquisition in syntax: (i) when two languages have a superficially similar syntactic structure that arguably involves different syntactic operations, can L2 learners acquire the difference? (ii) if successful acquisition of such a difference does occur, in what ways does that inform us about the nature of L2 acquisition of syntax? Despite such superficial similarities between Chinese and Japanese RCs, previous theoretical work puts forward different analyses for their syntactic structures. Thus, the first two parts of this dissertation provide novel experimental evidence indicating that the head noun phrase (NP) of RCs is only base-generated in Japanese but is either raised or base-generated in Chinese. Nevetheless, the experimental evidence also suggests that the raising strategy is preferred to the base-generation strategy to derive the head NP from the singly embedded object position of Chinese RCs. In the third part, I reported the findings from another experiment I created to explore whether L1 Chinese learners of L2 Japanese are able to acquire the syntactic knowledge that the head NP of Japanese RCs can only be base-generated. Since such knowledge is implicit, I used a diagnostic to test how L1 Chinese learners interpret the anaphor jibun ‘self’ within the head NP of Japanese RCs. The experimental results show that at least some advanced L1 Chinese learners of Japanese have acquired the difference between Chinese and Japanese RCs in terms of the interpretation of the anaphor inside the head NP, despite its underdetermined nature. This in turn argues for the Full Transfer/Full Access Hypothesis (Schwartz &amp; Sprouse, 1994, 1996) and argues against ‘partial access to UG’ approaches such as the Interpretability Hypothesis (Tsimpli &amp; Dimitrakopoulou, 2007).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-japanese-relative-clauses-l1-chinese/docview/2316439620/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Choi, Jung Eun",2019,"The Syntax-Pragmatics Interface in L2 Acquisition of Korean Case, Topic and Focus Particles","This dissertation investigates how adult second language (L2) learners of Korean attain the knowledge and use of four Korean particles, – i/ka ‘NOM’, - (l)ul ‘ACC’, - (n)un ‘TOP’, and – to ‘also/even’. All of these particles indicate the distinct pragmatic roles that noun phrases play in a given context. Therefore, L2 learners need to acquire the knowledge of pragmatic properties each particle is associated with in order to use them in a native-like way. In the first half of the dissertation, I characterize the four particles appealing to various semantico-pragmatic properties, and hypothesize that the computational load induced by such properties cause difficulty in the L2 acquisition of the four particles. In the latter half, I report an experimental study that tests this hypothesis. It also examines whether various aspects of learners’ first language (L1) would hinder or facilitate the acquisition of the four particles. In the experiment, a total of 130 participants (50 Chinese-speaking and 52 English-speaking learners at four proficiency levels and 28 native Korean-speaking controls) performed the forced-choice task, the acceptability task and the interpretation task. The results confirmed that the heavier computational load induced by the semantico-pragmatic property of the particle, the more difficult the acquisition of the particle. The results also indicated that approximate lexical encoding in L1 English did not facilitate the acquisition of the case particles in Korean, and that syntactic expression of topic in L1 Chinese helped the acquisition of generic topic marking, but it did not facilitate the acquisition of anaphoric or contrastive topic marking. Additionally, the results suggested that, due to L1 transfer, the additive focus particle - to was initially analyzed as an adverbial by Chinese-speaking and English-speaking learners, but its usage as an adnominal suffix was gradually acquired as the learners' proficiency level increased, and that lexical transfer facilitated scalar implicature computation, while lexical gaps caused difficulties. The dissertation sheds light on the nature of the L2 learning problems with respect to the four Korean particles, – i/ka ‘NOM’, - (l)ul ‘ACC’, - (n)un ‘TOP’, and – to ‘also/even’.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/syntax-pragmatics-interface-l2-acquisition-korean/docview/2305192482/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"DuBois, Stefan Karsten",2019,Are L2 Speakers Allowed to Use Colloquialisms? L1 Attitudes Toward Spanish L2 Speakers' Use of Informal Lexical Items,"Extensive literature demonstrates that, with extended contact and high integrative motivation, L2 speakers gradually acquire L2 nonstandard variation over time as a result of interaction with speakers of the target language (Dewaele &amp; Regan 2001, Dewaele 2002, Nagy et al. 2003, Raish 2015, Salgado-Robles 2011). Yet, some learners fear that adopting nonstandard variation would be inauthentic (Kinginger and Farrell 2004, Ringer-Hilfinger 2012, Trosset 1986), and various pedagogical models and scholarly works advocate against the dangers of overaccommodation, arguing that native speakers expect language learners to set a linguistic target more socially prestigious than the vernacular common to the L1 community (Andreasson 1994, Auger &amp; Valdman 1999, Christophersen 1973, Saville-Troike 2003, Valdman 1988). The question of how native speakers perceive L2 use of nonstandard variation has received little attention in terms of empirical studies, and results have been conflicting among the few works which have investigated the issue. Some have found that L1 speakers respond negatively to such language use (Prodromou 2007, Ruivivar &amp; Collins 2018, Swacker 1976) while others indicate the opposite (Beaulieu 2016; George 2013, 2014, 2017). The present study sought to clarify these conflicting findings by investigating the attitudes of L1 speakers of Peninsular Spanish to the use of colloquial lexical items by L1 speakers of English. The study utilized a matched guise methodology (Lambert et al. 1960), asking over 200 participants to evaluate audio samples of L1 and L2 speakers using colloquial language which was selected according to a corpus analysis of Peninsular Spanish. Participants assessed the speakers according to factors such as linguistic proficiency, the appropriateness of language use according to context, and personality traits corresponding with the dimensions of status, solidarity, and dynamism common to language attitudes research (Giles &amp; Billings 2004, Zahn &amp; Hopper 1985). The results of the study found that the use of colloquial language did not quantitatively correlate with significantly higher or lower measures of linguistic proficiency on a broad level, despite its use being highly salient to participants. In terms of measures of contextual appropriateness and personality ratings, the study found that L2 speakers experience many of the same disadvantages suffered by native speakers when using nonstandard language—for example, being downgraded on personality characteristics associated with status (successful, intelligent, etc.)—but they do not have the same level of access to corresponding advantages, such as increased ratings of traits indicating solidarity (sociable, friendly, etc.). While these results verify to some degree the existence of a double standard in attitudes toward nonstandard language use according to the speaker’s L1, the lack of concrete benefits available to L2 speakers using colloquial language constituted a bigger drawback than any outright negative associations made with its use; what negative associations did exist were by and large those experienced by L1 speakers, and these were not so negative as to justify theoretical arguments in the literature advocating the wholesale avoidance of its production. Instead, the results of this study suggest that so long as L2 users are aware of the potential risks associated with using such language, there seems to be no reason to discourage its production.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/are-l2-speakers-allowed-use-colloquialisms-l1/docview/2299815946/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Slabakova (2009, 2013) incorporated Lardiere’s proposal in establishing a scale of difficulty in learning semantic properties (e.g. definiteness) which is based on whether reassembly is needed and whether the universal meaning is obtained by overt morphology or context (See also Ramchand &amp; Svenonius, 2008). In considering the truth-conditional aspect of meaning, the feature-based framework is not powerful enough to account for the variability of interpretations that L2 learners come to learn. Take as an example the acquisition of English comparatives by Japanese L2 learners.

It has recently been acknowledged that learners' sensitivity to word-internal structures (morphological awareness) makes an important contribution to L2 lexical inferencing. However, it remains unclear whether the contribution of morphological awareness to lexical inferencing is affected by L2 learner-related factors (e.g., language skills). Data obtained from five paper-pencil tasks in Chinese for 73 L2 learners who studied Chinese for two semesters in China showed that (1) for more-skilled learners, morphological awareness significantly contributed to lexical inferencing with and without contextual cues, whereas no significant relationships existed between morphological awareness and lexical inferencing for less-skilled learners; and (2) L2 learners' morphological awareness does not equally facilitate lexical inferencing due to a possible threshold of linguistic knowledge.

"Chung Kam Kwok;Carson, Lorna",2018,Integrativeness and intended effort in language learning motivation amongst some young adult learners of Japanese,"Since the 1990s, many researchers in the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) have become focused on second/foreign language learners’ motivation to learn a language, and the role of motivation in determining future success. However, much of the research agenda has revolved around the acquisition of English as an Additional Language, and target languages other than English have been under-researched. This paper reports on a survey study designed to investigate the motivation of 84 beginner learners of Japanese learning the language in a university language centre evening programme. Examining the relationship between learners’ intended effort and six motivational orientations commonly used in SLA motivational studies using multiple linear regression, this study found that integrativeness was the only variable that contributed to learning motivation. This finding is in distinct contrast to studies focused on English learning where the ideal L2 self has often been found to be the best predictor of motivation. While it is far from sufficient to draw a conclusion that Japanese learning motivation is different from that of English based on one study, the current study does point to the key role of cultural identification in second/foreign language motivation, consistent with a small group of other motivational studies conducted in the context of Languages Other than English (LOTEs).", Journal Article,10.1515/cercles-2018-0016,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/integrativeness-intended-effort-language-learning/docview/2167872856/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Questions about whether and how learning is applied in different contexts are central to an understanding of human behavior, and answers to such questions are of practical value to educators.

This article explores these advancements through a synthesis of key research in the field of technology-mediated teaching and learning of ILP in five core areas – curricular materials, classroom interventions, telecollaboration, research methodologies, and expanding pragmatic practices.", Journal Article,10.1558/cj.36175,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/interlanguage-pragmatics-curricular-innovation/docview/2108875190/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Marijuan, Silvia;Sanz, Cristina",2018,Expanding Boundaries: Current and New Directions in Study Abroad Research and Practice,"In spite of advances in the understanding of the effects of the immersion experience on language and cultural development in the last three decades, many questions in study abroad (SA) research remain unanswered. The present article offers a close examination of the field as it is today with an eye toward future trends and gaps in the literature. The authors discuss how the field is being reshaped in response to the preponderant role of new technologies in research and educational practices; to constant challenges to diversify access for minority students, including heritage language learners; and to meeting the growing demands of a globalized economy and workforce. Current trends in SA program design such as the incorporation of servicelearning, volunteering, and internships into the SA curriculum are also given special consideration. The article focuses on language development first and then on the factors influencing that development that are internal and external to learners. Interfaces between these areas are addressed. Subsections of the article provide an outline of an innovative SA research agenda as well as suggestions for rethinking SA program design and implementation.", Journal Article,10.1111/flan.12323,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/expanding-boundaries-current-new-directions-study/docview/2018571952/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Slabakova, Roumyana",2018,L2 semantics from a formal linguistic perspective,"Ever since Aristotle and Plato (The Categories; Cratylus), linguists have considered language to be the pairing of form (sounds or gestures or written strings) and meaning. This is true for all meaningful linguistic units from morphemes, through words, phrases and sentences, to discourse. Generally speaking, semantics is the study of how form and meaning are related. However, semantics is more narrowly construed as excluding those meanings that derive from speaker intensions and psychological states, as well as sociocultural features of the context. Furthermore, the boundary between semantics proper and pragmatics is intensely debated and to some researchers constitutes an empirical question. Formal semantics came into being as a system describing formal languages, that is, the mathematical and logical languages of computing machines as opposed to the natural languages of human beings. However, in the late 1960s the philosopher Richard Montague argued that natural languages such as English could be fruitfully described using the same rigorous rules and correspondences utilized in the description of formal languages. Modern formal semantics was born and is currently prospering as a branch of linguistics.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0261444818000071,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/l2-semantics-formal-linguistic-perspective/docview/2014049456/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Shelton, Abigail Leigh",2018,Japanese Native Perceptions of the Facial Expressions of American Learners of L2 Japanese in Specified Contexts,"Grammatical errors in a foreign language point to us as bad speakers of the language, but pragmatic failures point to us as bad people (Thomas 1983). This is also true when using facial expressions in a second/foreign language (“L2”) or culture (“C2”). Facial expression research has revealed that while there are some cross-cultural universals in how we interpret certain facial expressions, whether we display, suppress, or even mask our facial expressions is governed by culture-specific conventions. Violations of these “display rules” (Ekman and Friesen 1969)—just like violations of pragmatic language strategies—can have unintended results. When American learners enter the L2 Japanese classroom, they are already armed with facial expression strategies associated and integrated with their L1. These strategies unconsciously translate into their performances in L2 Japanese, although the effects of such transfer have yet to be studied. To learn about the perceptions that Japanese natives have of the facial expressions of L2 speakers of Japanese, data were collected through an online survey from 30 Japanese women in Japan and the US. First, a Likert scale was used to measure the respondents' assessments of the naturalness and appropriateness of the L2 Japanese performances of four performers: one 1 st -year and one 2 nd -year American learner of Japanese; one advanced American speaker of Japanese; and one native speaker of Japanese. Next, a “select-all that apply” question was used to identify (i) which facial expressions the raters observed in each performance, and (ii) which of those observed were violations for the context. Finally, raters gave written feedback about the performances and how they could have been made more culturally appropriate. An ordinal regression revealed no statistically significant difference between the naturalness and appropriateness ratings, indicating that both are likely measuring aspects of the same behavioral construct. A Kruskal-Wallis H test revealed a statistically significant difference between the naturalness and appropriateness ratings of the beginner learners of Japanese and the advanced speaker (p=0.009), as well as between the advanced and native speakers (p=0.003). This finding suggests that either non-native speakers naturally acquire L2-appropriate facial expressions over time with exposure to the target culture, or that a higher language proficiency yields more appropriate facial expressions as learners become more comfortable speaking in Japanese. Either way, explicitly teaching and having learners perform these facial expressions could speed up the process of acquiring these facial expression skills. Another ordinal regression showed that raters' years of work experience in Japan had a weak positive effect on naturalness ratings. While it is unclear exactly what this means, it could indicate that the longer a Japanese native has lived in Japan, the more positively she is likely to view the facial expressions of American learners of Japanese. Finally, written feedback was analyzed using the grounded theory approach (Glaser and Strauss 1967). Several display conventions and the contextualization cues (Gumperz 1982) that triggered them were identified for each context. Future research could utilize these display conventions and see if learners can be taught to follow them in their L2 Japanese performances.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/japanese-native-perceptions-facial-expressions/docview/2202446578/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Young, Eric H.",2018,Promoting Second Language Learning Through Oral Asynchronous Computer-Mediated Communication,"Learning to speak a foreign language (L2) can be a challenging feat, made all the more challenging when done in only 50 minute, daily increments in class. Oral asynchronous computer-mediated communication (ACMC) provides learners with opportunities to practice spoken communication and evaluate their practice outside the classroom. In this dissertation, I explore methods for classroom integration of oral ACMC, linguistic traits developed in previous oral ACMC studies, methods for determining the effectiveness of oral ACMC, learner beliefs about the effectiveness of oral ACMC activities, and the effects of learners’ deliberate practice in a series of oral ACMC activities on 3 measures of L2 fluency. In my first article, a literature review, I found that most studies on this topic focus on the linguistic traits of accuracy, fluency, and pronunciation, and determine L2 growth from oral ACMC activities through learner perceptions of L2 growth not relying on objective measures. In my second article, I analyzed the fluency change of learners who participated in a series of video recording and feedback activities. I found that, although there were few significant results, the activities may be of some benefit to learners in improving their spoken fluency. I also found that structural equational modelling may be of more value for researching classroom-based activities than t tests and regression models. In my third article, I investigated the experiences of several learners who participated in the video recording activities described in article two. Based on these learner experiences, I provided key considerations for designing asynchronous video recording assignments. The three articles included in this dissertation will be valuable in highlighting key factors related to the design, development, research, and effective use of oral ACMC activities in foreign language classrooms.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/promoting-second-language-learning-through-oral/docview/2167091402/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Sunara, Simona",2018,Effects of Explicit Instruction and Corrective Feedback on the Acquisition of the French Accentual Phrase by Native Speakers of English,"It is now well recognized that second language (L2) instruction and corrective feedback (CF) have significant positive effects on the acquisition of L2 pronunciation (e.g., Saito, 2012; Derwing &amp; Munro, 2015; Lee, Jang &amp; Plonsky, 2015; Thomson &amp; Derwing, 2015). The objective of the present dissertation is to further our understanding of the effects of explicit instruction and CF via the study of the acquisition of the French Accentual Phrase (AP), a primary unit of prosodic organization, by native speakers of English. To this end, two inter-related experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 involved ten English-speaking learners of French who completed word recognition and delayed elicited imitation tasks that assessed their accuracy in the perception and production of APs, respectively. In perception, these learners showed limited accuracy with respect to the increased pitch and duration that cue AP-final syllables in French. In production, they produced too many, insufficiently large APs, and were non-target-like in the phonetic realization of the final LH* rise that signals the final full syllable of this prosodic unit. Experiment 2 then examined whether an instructional treatment that targeted the difficulties identified in Experiment 1 could increase learners’ accuracy in perception and production. Eight English-speaking learners of French were provided with six hours of explicit instruction and CF. Gains in perception and production accuracy were assessed using a pre-/post-test design involving the same tasks as in Experiment 1. While the treatment did not lead to gains in perceptual accuracy with the final LH* rise, there was significant improvement in learners’ production of appropriately sized APs and of the final LH* rise. In summary, this dissertation contributes to the growing literature on L2 pronunciation instruction via the study of a previously unstudied prosodic structure in a relatively understudied target language, French, and demonstrates the potential benefits of explicit instruction including CF on L2 phonological and phonetic development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-explicit-instruction-corrective-feedback/docview/2156663882/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Monfaredi, Elham",2019,Occasioned Storytelling in Persian Language Classrooms,"The use of stories as pedagogical tools in second language (L2) classrooms has a longstanding research tradition (e.g., Huang, 2006; Inal &amp; Cakir, 2014). In these studies, stories are deployed as prepackaged instructional tools that are incorporated into lesson plans and embedded in the overall pedagogical concept. However, the ways in which stories figure as naturally occurring activities in L2 classroom interaction remains an understudied research topic. This investigation utilizes a conversation analytic approach in which storytelling is viewed as a social, situated activity that is locally occasioned, collaboratively accomplished, and interactionally consequential. Specifically, the study examines how impromptu stories unfold during ongoing instructional activities and what actions they accomplish in L2 classroom settings. The data come from 37 hours of videorecorded intermediate and advanced Persian classes at two North American universities. For analysis, multimodal conversation analysis (Mondada, 2014) and membership categorization analysis (Sacks, 1972; Fitzgerald &amp; Housley, 2015; Hester &amp; Eglin, 1997) are combined to examine the sequential and categorial production of stories told by teachers and students. In the corpus of stories told by the teachers, stories are launched in first position to exemplify, elaborate, or extend upon the ongoing pedagogical project, and in second position to provide counter examples and accounts, or to reject or accept students’ proposals. In contrast, students’ stories begin in responsive positions to accomplish actions such as giving accounts and bringing their cultural competencies and membership knowledge to the forefront. The findings also demonstrate that stories typically orient to the current pedagogical agenda or accomplish a particular instructional action. The study enhances applied linguistic knowledge about storytelling as a social practice in ongoing classroom interaction and thus contributes to the large field of second language classroom research. It also contributes to the scant research literature on instruction in Persian as a foreign language and begins to place pedagogical practice in the teaching of Persian on an empirical footing.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/occasioned-storytelling-persian-language/docview/2316417912/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Halenko, Nicola;Economidou-Kogetsidis, Maria",2022,"Japanese Learners' Spoken Requests in the Study Abroad Context: Appropriateness, Speech Rate and Response Time","Studies that have measured pragmatic fluency in the form of planning time and speech rate, as indicators of processing ability, have confirmed that learners' processing ability and pragmatic knowledge are independent from each other. The present study is a longitudinal, developmental investigation which investigates whether the study abroad stay (SA) has an effect on the overall appropriateness, planning time and speech rate in high and low imposition situations of ten L2 Japanese learners' oral requestive output during their overseas sojourn. With the exception of appropriateness which had the most positive change, (mainly with low imposition requests), the study found that the SA had minimal positive impact on the variables examined, suggesting that activation and processing of pragmatic knowledge needs enhancement from other sources, and that learners need a longer period of time to develop appropriate pragmatic output across a range of academic encounters. Results further revealed much individual variation, further highlighting the complexity of examining pragmatic performance over time."," Article , Report",10.1080/09571736.2022.2088441,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/japanese-learners-spoken-requests-study-abroad/docview/2861152950/se-2?accountid=9902,eric
"Iwasaki, Noriko",2010,Style Shifts among Japanese Learners before and after Study Abroad in Japan: Becoming Active Social Agents in Japanese,"Previous studies on L2 Japanese sojourners often reported that learners overuse the plain style or haphazardly mix the plain and polite styles upon return. These styles, which are often associated with formal or informal contexts, also index complex social and situational meanings, and native speakers are reported to shift their styles to create desired contexts. In order to better understand L2 development of the use of the plain and polite styles during study abroad, the current study examined the use of the polite/plain styles and style shifts among five English-speaking male students who studied in Japan for one academic year by comparing their performances both quantitatively and qualitatively in oral proficiency interviews before and after they studied abroad. Upon return, three predominantly used the polite style talking to the interviewer (their former teacher), while two primarily used the plain style. Though the quantitative analysis may lead one to conclude that these two students regressed in their pragmatic competence, the qualitative analysis revealed that all five learners gained some understanding of social meanings of the plain and polite styles and became more active social agents who make decisions to shift the styles."," Article , Report",10.1093/applin/amn047,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/style-shifts-among-japanese-learners-before-after/docview/61807181/se-2?accountid=9902,eric
,2011,L2 Learning as Social Practice Conversation-Analytic Perspectives,"This volume collects empirical studies applying Conversation Analysis to situations where second, third and other additional languages are used. A number of different aspects are considered, including how linguistic systems develop over time through social interaction, how participants 'do' language learning and teaching in classroom and everyday settings, how they select languages and manage identities in multilingual contexts and how the linguistic-interactional divide can be bridged with studies combining Conversation Analysis and Functional Linguistics. This variety of issues and approaches clearly shows the fruitfulness of a socio-interactional perspective on second language learning. PRAGMATICS &amp; INTERACTION, a refereed series sponsored by the University of Hawai'i National Foreign Language Resource Center, publishes research on topics in pragmatics and discourse as social interaction from a wide variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives.

"Menard-Warwick, Julia;Leung, Genevieve",2017,Translingual Practice in L2 Japanese: Workplace Narratives,"Translingual practice is an emergent theoretical perspective which emphasizes the capacity and disposition for meaning-making across linguistic boundaries. Following on studies of globalized workplaces that have focused on lingua franca English, this article explores translingual practice as represented in interview and blog narratives recounted by multilingual, multiethnic young adults hired by Japanese schools and companies for their English proficiency. In these metapragmatic narratives of interactions with supervisors and coworkers, participants portray themselves surmounting communicative challenges through investment in L2 Japanese, and especially through pragmatic accommodation to local norms. In this way, they avoid maintaining widespread ideologies that delegitimize Japanese L2 speakers."," Article , Report",10.1080/14708477.2016.1277532,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/translingual-practice-l2-japanese-workplace/docview/1941340611/se-2?accountid=9902,eric

"Narita, Ritsuko",2009,The Effects of Pragmatic Consciousness-Raising Activities on the Development of Pragmatic Awareness and Use of Hearsay Evidential Markers for Learners of Japanese as a Foreign Language,"The present study investigates the effectiveness of pragmatic consciousness-raising (PCR) activities in the L2 pragmatic acquisition of hearsay evidential markers by learners of Japanese as a foreign language (JFL). PCR is essentially an inductive approach to facilitating awareness of how language forms are used appropriately in a given context. Regarding consciousness-raising, Schmidt (1990, 1993, 1994, 1995, 2001) has proposed his noticing hypothesis that no learning can occur without awareness. Therefore, the study explores the question of whether there can be learning without awareness. A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest format (immediate and delayed) was adopted. Forty-one JFL learners participated in this study. They were undergraduate and graduate students in the US. The JFL learners were divided into two groups: the PCR treatment group and the control group. The pretests were administered one day prior to the treatment sessions. The tests consist of two metapragmatic knowledge tests and an oral discourse production test. In total, four experimental sessions (30 minutes per session) were given to the PCR group. During the treatment sessions, the JFL learners in the PCR group first compared hearsay reports in L1 English and L1 Japanese, and then compared hearsay reports in L1 Japanese and L2 Japanese. After the treatment periods were over, the learners in both groups were asked to complete immediate posttests. Lastly, one month after the treatment sessions, both groups took delayed posttests. The JFL learners in the PCR activities performed both the immediate posttests and the delayed posttests better than the control group. These results indicate that it may be effective for JFL learners to learn the features of hearsay evidential markers in Japanese through discourse analysis and become able to use hearsay expressions in a native Japanese-like manner. With regard to the feedback from the PCR participants, some students provided positive feedback on the analysis exercises using natural discourse data. They commented that it is always good to read more real examples that do not come from a textbook. Through the PCR activities, L2 learners may be made aware of critical differences between L1 and L2 pragmatics.

"Tateyama, Yumiko",2009,Learning to request in Japanese through foreign language classroom instruction.,"This study examines the effects of instructional practices on Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) learners' pragmatic competence in learning how to request in Japanese. It also investigates how instructional effects are displayed depending on the type of outcome measure (Jeon & Kaya, 2006). A preliminary study, conducted prior to the main study in order to investigate strengths and weaknesses of JFL learners of different proficiency levels when requesting in Japanese, showed that the learners had difficulties with opening and closing moves, request strategies, and the sociopragmatic aspects of requesting. These findings were incorporated into the instructional materials for the main study. The participants in the main study were JFL learners enrolled in fourth-semester university-level Japanese courses. Two classes (Regular group, <i>N=22</i> ) received regular explicit instruction on requests following a course syllabus, while two others (Expanded group, <i>N=24</i>) received additional pragmatics instruction. The effect of instruction was measured through four outcome measures that involved request-making situations: discourse completion task (DCT), telephone message task, role play task and video clip rating task. The data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. A significant instructional effect was revealed in the telephone and role play tasks. Moreover, the learners performed significantly better in the role play than in the telephone task, which was attributed to the presence of the interlocutor who offered repairs to ratify the learners' requestive intent or candidate understanding. This finding suggests that interactive versus non-interactive tasks might differentially affect the learning outcome. A relatively large instructional effect was found in the video task which examined the learners' metapragmatic awareness. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the number of conventionally indirect strategies in the post-test DCT, telephone and role play tasks that examined learners' use of request strategies. This suggests that instructional effects manifest in a similar manner regardless of the type of outcome measure. Overall, there was no significant difference between the groups. While learner requests became sequentially better organized in the post-test, both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic problems remained. The study contributes to the research literature on the effect of instruction on the classroom learning of L2 pragmatics.

"Danjo, Chisato",2015,"A Critical Ethnographic Inquiry into the Negotiation of Language Practices Among Japanese Multilingual Families in the UK: Discourse, Language Use and Perceptions in the <em>Hoshuko</em> and the Family Home","This thesis is a sociolinguistic examination of the ways in which multilingual children and parents negotiate their language use. Through a critical ethnographic inquiry, it focuses in particular on Japanese-English multilingual parents and their pre- and early-school age children living in the UK, across two fields: a Japanese government approved complementary school (Hoshuko), and the family home where parents employ multilingual family language policies (FLP). My main interest is in exploring the ways in which discourses emerging from the policies (governmental and institutional policies regarding Hoshuko, and FLP) are reproduced and/or challenged by individuals’ situated practices and perceptions. Defining multilingualism as a set of social practices and processes, the thesis explores the following four themes: 1) discourses of Hoshuko policies and of FLP, 2) individuals’ language practices and 3) perceptions in the Hoshuko and in the family home; and 4) the mutual influence of discourses, practices and perceptions. By employing Critical Discourse Analysis to analyse relevant Japanese governmental policy documents, as well as the school prospectuses of all nine Hoshuko in the UK, I disclosed the governmental and institutional discourses (Chapter 4). The discourses were then compared with individuals’ situated practices and perceptions identified at one of those Hoshuko, where I conducted a 16-month ethnographic fieldwork (Chapter 5). The discourse of FLP was also scrutinised by comparing it with family language practices and perceptions in the family home (Chapter 6). As a whole, this thesis reveals discrepancies between the governmental and institutional discourse, as well as individuals’ situated practices and perceptions. On one hand, governmental and institutional discourses are undermined by individuals’ flexible practices in particular situations. On the other hand, multilingual individuals also seem to be influenced by discourses which they reflect in their own perceptions; consequently, some multilingual practices go unacknowledged at the level of perceptions. Overall, this thesis enriches our understanding of the dynamics between macro level ideological influences emerging from policy discourses and micro level practices, and of the complexity of individuals’ perceptions involved in the legitimation of their practices in the context of a complementary school and the family home.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/critical-ethnographic-inquiry-into-negotiation/docview/1857773380/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hondo, Junko",2009,Constructing knowledge in SLA: The impact of timing in form -focused intervention,"In an effort to identify an optimal timing for form-oriented treatment, this dissertation reports on the impact of different timings of form-focused intervention. Applying the theories of attentional control (Cowan, et al. , 2005; LaBerge, 1995), the study further attempts to shed light on the role of preparatory attentional control at the initial stage of form-encoding. A reading task served as a framework for exploring different timings of treatment with 58 EFL students in Japan. The informants were classified into three groups: one group receiving explicit treatment before the task, another during, and a control group receiving no treatment. Participants took pretests and posttests immediately before and after the task in a single class session. These tests examined comprehension of two epistemic meanings of ‘must’ in two individual forms. Working with these task-essential forms, each informant recorded real-time reflections reporting rationales for their selections from different form options in the task. The participants’ rationales revealed that contextualized reflections are strongly associated with higher accuracy levels in choosing between alternate forms. Decontextualized rationales were associated with incorrect selections of forms at a high level of probability. Group difference was highly significant for one form and significant for the other form in the order of Control &lt; Pre-emptive &lt; Delayed group. Effect sizes were large (e.g. 2.00) for the delayed group which outperformed the pre-emptive group. The pattern of the results replicated three prior studies with 286 participants. The overall results present a promising role for delayed treatment reactive to raised preparatory attention. The outcome further confirms that it is through making connections between form and meaning within current language use that learners become successful in language comprehension.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/constructing-knowledge-sla-impact-timing-form/docview/305062523/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Suzuki, Wataru",2009,"Languaging, direct correction, and second language writing: Japanese university students of English","It has been suggested that languaging plays a crucial role in learning a second language (L2). The effect of languaging, especially oral languaging (e.g., collaborative dialogue, private speech), has been tested on the learning of L2 knowledge domains. Many studies have shown a positive relation between oral languaging during problem solving tasks and subsequent performance on various post-test measures. The paucity of empirical research on written languaging (e.g., written reflection, written/typed explanations, and diaries) in second language acquisition (SLA) research, despite its theoretical importance for learning and the empirical evidence documented in non-L2 knowledge domains, prompted this exploratory study. This study explored the effects of written languaging about the direct corrections provided on draft essays written by 24 Japanese learners of English. The effect of both the type (e.g., grammar-based vs. lexis-based) and the quality (e.g., noticing with reasons vs. noticing only) of written languaging was assessed by subsequent text revisions. Three major findings emerged. First, written languaging about direct feedback on linguistic errors in the first essay helped learners successfully correct these errors during immediate revision and possibly aided in rendering the new essay more accurate. Second, both lexis- and grammar-based written languaging were associated with improved accuracy. Third, both written languaging at the level of noticing only and written languaging at the level of noticing with reasons were associated with accuracy improvement. These findings appear to support Swain's (2006b) claim that providing learners with the opportunity to language about or reflect on their developing linguistic knowledge in the course of L2 learning mediates L2 learning and development. Theoretical and pedagogical implications are also discussed in this thesis study. Theoretically, the study, together with other research indicates that we learn an L2 not only by manipulating the linguistic input inside the head but also by externalizing it via speaking and writing (i.e., languaging). Pedagogically, the implications of the study may suggest that L2 teachers should ask their students to reflect, in diaries, journals, and portfolios, on the linguistic problems they have encountered during their classroom activities.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/languaging-direct-correction-second-language/docview/305102609/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Inutsuka, Kumiko",2009,Component skills analyses for Japanese adult second language readers: The role of cognitive and linguistic skills and processing speed in predicting reading performance,"The research addressed two theoretical issues: the role of lower-level processing skills in reading and the transfer of first language (L1) processing skills to second language (L2) reading among adult Japanese learners of English. The component skills of word recognition are crucial predictors of literacy acquisition for English children and adult English as a second language (ESL) readers (Koda, 2005). Nassaji and Geva (1999) demonstrated the importance of these skills for adult L2 readers whose first language was alphabetic (Farsi). However, the involvement of these processes in the English L2 reading performance of adults whose L1 orthography is typologically distant is still unclear. The first study investigated whether component processing skills explained the English L2 reading performance of Japanese students, whose L1 orthography is nonalphabetic. The second study addressed the issue of L1 - L2 transfer. Some aspects of word recognition processing, such as phonological processing, transfer cross-linguistically between alphabetic languages and also between typologically distant languages for bilingual children. It is not clear whether this holds true for adult readers who acquire their L2 literacy subsequent to their L1 literacy. The second study investigated whether this transfer can be observed for the EFL (English as a foreign language) reading of Japanese adults. The accuracy and speed of processing skills at the word and text levels in English and Japanese were analyzed for 62 Japanese undergraduate students learning English in Japan. Their cognitive, linguistic, and sub-word processing skills were measured. The results of the first study underscore the importance of phonological and orthographic processing skills in explaining adults' L2 reading performance at the word and text levels. The study adds to the literature that discusses the importance of lower-level processing skills for the reading performance of second language learners (Grabe, 1988; Koda, 1996, 2005; Nassaji &amp; Geva, 1999). In the second study, there was a limited correlation between the L1 and L2 accuracy scores, possibly reflecting orthographic differences. Although the participants' L1 and L2 phonological processing skills did not correlate, the speed of executing tasks correlated between English and Japanese, suggesting that processing speed may be an underlying skill.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/component-skills-analyses-japanese-adult-second/docview/305104893/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kaku, Keiko",2009,Acquisition of telicity in L2: A psycholinguistic study of Japanese learners of English,"This dissertation investigates the acquisition of the semantics of telicity by Japanese learners of English with emphasis on a particular grammatical phenomenon, the neutral perfective reading of simple past predicates (Singh, 1991), which is available in Japanese but not in English. Three main points are of interest in this dissertation: First, we examine whether or not Japanese learners of English learn to derive the telicity of a simple past predicate despite lack of explicit classroom instruction. Second, we investigate potential factors that may assist L2 learners in discovering a target-like representation of the predicate telicity in English. Finally, we aim at revealing the L2 learners' developmental profile for the acquisition of the semantics of telicity. Two experimental tasks, a morphological task and a truth-value judgment task, were conducted which included three proficiency levels of L2 learners (beginner, intermediate and advanced), as well as native speakers of English and Japanese. Empirical data from the experimental tasks indicated that Japanese learners of English succeeded in progressing towards target-like representation of telicity. While the beginners directly transferred the L1 Japanese representation of the semantics of predicate telicity onto their target language, the intermediate and advanced levels dissociated the telicity of the English simple past predicates from that of the Japanese past predicates. That is, they learned to invalidate the neutral perfective reading of English predicates. We postulate that L2 learners' progress in the acquisition of the semantics of English predicate telicity can be accounted for by the acquisition of Det/Num morphology and by a Bayesian learning model: This learning model helps learners use L2 input to make form-meaning inferences on the predicate telicity and aids them to gradually acquire the most appropriate representation of English predicate telicity.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-telicity-l2-psycholinguistic-study/docview/89184127/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Wang, Kenny",2010,The acquisition of English passive constructions by Mandarin speakers: A developmental perspective,"The acquisition and the felicitous use of discourse-pragmatic devices is an important milestone for L2 learners. This study utilises Processability Theory (Pienemann, 1998; Pienemann, Di Biase, and Kawaguchi, 2005) as the language development framework to investigate the acquisition of English passive constructions by Mandarin L1 learners of English L2. The study aims to investigate the development of various English passive constructions in the interlanguage of Mandarin L1 learners of English L2. The hypotheses are that learners at lower stages of development will use only the active construction, and that passive constructions will be more effortful for learners to process due to the greater processing loads involved in the required argument grammatical function mapping. Furthermore, it is hypothesised that learners' development of various constructions under the passive voice category will proceed in a sequential fashion.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-english-passive-constructions/docview/1945939044/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Clenton, Jonathan",2010,Investigating the construct of productive vocabulary knowledge with Lex30,"This thesis investigates the construct of productive vocabulary knowledge with a productive vocabulary task, Lex30. The task is designed to elicit up to four vocabulary items in response to each of 30 cues. In this way, Lex30 generates a corpus for each subject up to 120 words, which is then categorised according to frequency bands. The test is scored according to the number, or proportion, of infrequent words elicited, with infrequent defined as all items excluding the most frequently occurring 1000 English words. The higher the Lex30 score, then, the more infrequent words that subject has produced in response to the cues. Each corpus generated by Lex30, therefore, offers information about subjects' relative knowledge of infrequent items, although this might only be threshold knowledge. A feature of Lex30 is that it appears to measure productive vocabulary knowledge discretely: it does not activate multiple aspects of language knowledge, and is not context engaging. This feature suggests that we can measure one of the many aspects that are commonly considered to constitute language knowledge, productive vocabulary knowledge, without interference from other aspects of language knowledge. Additionally, Lex30 offers the potential to hypothesize about subjects' relative L2 proficiency in terms of the proportion of infrequent items they provide. To investigate the construct of productive vocabulary with Lex30, this thesis examines, in a principled way, exactly what aspect of language competence it measures, and makes comparisons with other cognate tests. The test has been used in a number of contexts since its introduction; this thesis offers a thorough investigation of its reliability, different versions of the scoring system, the influence cue frequency and of specific cue items, and the mode of task delivery and response. The thesis concludes that Lex30 provides us with a helpful means to understand the construct of productive vocabulary knowledge.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigating-construct-productive-vocabulary/docview/2008472046/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Sato, Keiko",2010,A comparative study of complaint sequences in English and Japanese,"A small but important set of studies on complaint speech acts have been focused on certain aspects of native speaker (NS) and non-native speaker (NNS) complaints such as strategy use and native speaker judgment, (Du, 1995; House &amp; Kasper, 1981; Morrow, 1995; Murphy &amp; Neu, 1996; Olshtein &amp; Weinbach, 1987; Trosborg, 1995). However, few researchers have comprehensively researched complaint interactions. Complaining to the person responsible for the complainable (as opposed to complaining about a third party or situation) is a particularly face-threatening speech act, with social norms that vary from culture to culture. This study was an investigation of how Japanese and Americans express their dissatisfaction to those who caused it in their native language and in the target language (Japanese or English). The data analyzed are from the role-play performances of four situations by ten dyads in each of four groups (native speakers of Japanese speaking Japanese to a Japanese (JJJ), native speakers of English speaking English to an American (EEE), native speakers of Japanese speaking English to a native speaker of English (JEE), and native speakers of English speaking Japanese to a native speaker of Japanese (EJJ). The complaint categories used in this study represent a pared-down version of Trosborg’s (1995) categories based on two criteria: (a) hinting or mentioning complainable and (b) negative assessment of the complainer’s action or of the complainer as a person. The following characteristics of the complaint interactions were analyzed: (a) the length of interactions in terms of the number of turns, (b) complaint strategies used by complainers, (c) initial complaint strategies used by complainers, (d) the comparison of S1Hint and S2Cmpl as the initial position, (e) interaction flow in terms of complaint severity levels, 6) strategies employed by complainees, and (f) flow of complaint interactions between complainers and complainees. The results indicate some differences between the groups of native speakers of English and Japanese in the length of their interactions and the use of strategies by complainers and complainees. In general, complaint sequences in English were shorter, and the complaint strategies used by the JJJ group were less indirect than those used by the EEE group. Several protptypical complaint sequences are described. Concerning the use of strategies, the JEE and EJJ groups used strategies more in line with those employed by target language speakers, rather than by speakers of their own language. An attempt is made to account for the different characteristics of English and Japanese complaints in terms of linguistic resources. Pedagogical implications are also highlighted.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comparative-study-complaint-sequences-english/docview/305211429/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zhang, Yongfang",2010,Performance-based Chinese L2 reading instruction: A spiral approach,"Reading is a social activity. It happens in a social context with identifiable purpose. The reading purposes determine what the readers will read and how they will read. In daily life, reading is assessed by the fulfillment of a reading task. Good readers can successfully sense the reading task, visually perceive the signs, go through cognitive process, achieve certain interaction with the text, and finally display a response to the task. However, current L1 and L2 reading research treats reading comprehension as the most essential part of reading, and focuses on reading cognitive process. Consequently, current reading instruction is comprehension-oriented and concentrated on fluency instruction and reading strategy instruction. In the case of Chinese L2 reading instruction in the United States, where Chinese has very little similarity with the learners’ native language, the situation is even more severe. Reading instruction is primarily focused on linguistic factors, especially at the beginner and intermediate levels. This dissertation proposes a new Chinese L2 reading instruction model, which is performance based. In the new approach, the objective of instruction is to train the learners to perform reading tasks successfully in appropriate social context. It moves beyond reading comprehension and treats it as the prerequisite of the performance. To implement, performance-based reading instruction constructs social contexts for learners, provides opportunities for the learners to read in these contexts, and trains the learners to fulfill the recognized reading tasks. This new approach usually includes three phases. The three phases are built around the same theme and spiral up from reading comprehension of the text, to the demonstration of reading comprehension through tasks, and finally to handling authentic reading materials in simulated culturally appropriate tasks. Theoretical support from previous literacy research and by preliminary observations and surveys indicate that this new approach has many advantages over conventional instruction. It can enhance the learners’ comprehension of the text, improve their reading competence, and motivate them to extend their engagement in reading activities. Specifically, the culturally appropriate context in the performance-based reading instruction can trigger learners’ prior knowledge and L1 reading strategies, and thus can facilitate comprehension. In addition, the learners can tap into more mental resources during the reading process so that they will retain better long-term memories. Last but most importantly, the learners can retrieve their memory better by matching the daily situation with their learning contexts during the performance-base instruction. As a result, the learners will have better chance to perform successfully when expected to do so in later life.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/performance-based-chinese-l2-reading-instruction/docview/305221179/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tran, Tammie M.",2010,An exploration of the relationship between Vietnamese students' knowledge of L1 grammar and their English grammar proficiency,"The problem . This research study explores an important issue in the field of TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) and second language acquisition (SLA). Its purpose is to examine the relationship between Vietnamese students' L1 grammar knowledge and their English grammar proficiency. Furthermore, it investigates the extent to which English grammar proficiency and language transfer in Vietnamese speakers of English are influenced by linguistic factors (first and second language grammar proficiency levels) and non-linguistic factors (the effects of age at the onset of learning English and the length of U.S. residence). Method . This study examined the relationship between Vietnamese students' L1 grammar knowledge and their English grammar proficiency and their language transfer. These issues were further analyzed in relation to age at the onset of learning English, length of U.S. residence, and L1 and L2 grammar proficiency levels. Ninety one participants, age range of 18–65, were the Vietnamese-American students from universities and colleges in Southern California. Results . Through the questionnaires of demographic and educational backgrounds and the results of the test scores, participants' Vietnamese and English grammar proficiency and language transfer levels were reported. Their performance in three tests, Vietnamese and English grammar tests, Vietnamese-English translation test, and the questionnaire were analyzed to investigate whether there was the correlation between Vietnamese L1 grammar and English L2 grammar proficiency. Additionally, these results also examined English grammar learning and language transfer in relation to age at the onset of learning English, length of U.S. residence, and L1 and L2 grammar proficiency levels. Regarding the relationship between Vietnamese L1 and English L2 grammar proficiency, the study showed that there was no significant correlation between the Vietnamese students' L1 grammar proficiency test scores and their L2 English grammar proficiency test scores. Furthermore, L2 grammar proficiency and language transfer varied depending on age at the onset of learning English, L1 and L2 proficiency levels, and areas of language and linguistics. In the area of the effect of the length of U.S. residence on L2 grammar proficiency and language transfer, the study indicated the influence of length of U.S. residence only on language transfer and the variance depended on areas of language and linguistics. The quality of L2 input, rather than length of U.S. residence, may affect L2 grammar learning and language transfer as well, which may be an inspiration for future research. Other suggestions for future research are further provided. The results of this research study have several pedagogical implications: The study has an implication for retaining native language(s) as learning several languages simultaneously does not cause serious impediments, but rather fosters language interdependence. Additionally, further pedagogical implications of this study are of great importance because the results can be applied not only to Vietnamese L1 speakers, but also to ESL/EFL learners from various L1 backgrounds.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploration-relationship-between-vietnamese/docview/502582663/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Takigawa, Yuzuru",2010,Language expertise as a source of dispute in bilingual couple talk,"This study explores dispute sequences in talk between bilingual couples communicating in Japanese. Specifically I examine naturally occurring face-to-face talk between Japanese wives and their American husbands who communicate primarily in Japanese at home. Conversation analysis (CA) is employed to document occasions where the talk between these couples evolves into problematic talk such as disputes. The analytical focus is on sequences where problematic talk is related to the participants’ orientation to such contrasting identities as native/non-native speaker and expert/novice categories. A total of 16 hours of conversations were audio-recorded in the couples’ homes while they were engaged in everyday activities such as eating meals. The analysis of the data revealed several separate but related issues. First, the couples made their language expert and novice identities relevant in their talk when they conducted metalingual talk, i.e., talk about the Japanese language. Specifically, these identities emerged through repair sequences on occasions when one person had difficulty understanding or producing a lexical item and his or her spouse provided assistance with the problematic item. Second, problematic episodes, such as dispute sequences, were often occasioned by metalingual talk. Third, Japanese native and non-native speaker identities were sometimes separated from differential language expertise. When this happens, the native speaker disputes it and problematic talk occurs. The findings indicated that language expertise should be thought of as something that is independent to being a “native speaker” of a language. Being a language expert is locally situated in and negotiated through the ongoing talk and non-native speakers can be language experts as well. However, the data in this study show that the native speakers of Japanese, Japanese wives, sometimes perceived their non-native American husbands as disputing their expertise when they were engaged in metalingual talk. The American husbands occasionally displayed their expertise and argued against their Japanese wives on linguistic issues or did not acknowledge the expert information provided by the wives. When that happened, their talk became problematic, as the native speaker wives claimed that they were the experts and not the non-native husbands. In sum, this study revealed that dispute in intercultural marriage is in some cases due to language expertise displayed in the interactions. Dispute emerges through the on-going talk and is not determined based on the second language speaker’s disfluency or differences between the speakers’ cultural backgrounds, a claim that is frequently made in other fields such as intercultural communication, second language studies, and sociolinguistics. This newly identified phenomena based on language expertise is at the root of dispute in bilingual couple talk.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/language-expertise-as-source-dispute-bilingual/docview/608740745/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Fukuda, Chie",2010,"Identity construction, negotiation, and resistance: Reconsideration of “Japanese” identity","This dissertation explores identity construction, mainly focusing on the ethnonational identity of “Japanese,” in contrast to that of “non-Japanese” from ethnomethodological and social constructionist perspectives. Within these approaches, identity is not given a priori but emerges through sociohistorical contexts and discursive practices at both micro and macro levels. Based on these approaches, the study also attempts to overcome the epistemological and methodological limitations of previous studies. Many studies on identity issues in Japan do not take social constructionist approaches, but regard the identities of Japanese and non-Japanese as fixed and static. Also, many studies in social sciences are theory- or text-oriented, hence lacking in micro level conversational data where participants produce social order and worldviews. On the other hand, others exclusively focus on conversational data, paying little attention to larger sociohistorical contexts behind micro level interaction. The purpose of this study is to integrate micro and macro level analyses and substantiate understanding of identity construction in people’s daily lives in Japan. Utilizing Conversation Analysis and Membership Categorization Analysis, the study explores what kinds of identities are constructed, and how they are assigned, asserted, resisted, and negotiated in social interaction between L1 and L2 users of Japanese. The analysis not only reveals the emergence of ethnonational identities but also of many other identities and the shifts among them. It also demonstrates ideological aspects in the construction of “Japanese” identity revealed in the sense-making process on the side of the Japanese participants and resistance offered by the non-Japanese participants. By presenting these data and analyses, this study suggests reconsidering “Japanese” identity as: (a) a sociohistorical and discursive construct; (b) a topic to be investigated, not as a resource for researchers; and (c) participants’ accomplishments in social interaction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/identity-construction-negotiation-resistance/docview/734717964/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ishida, Midori",2010,Development of interactional competence in L2 Japanese during study abroad: The use of modal expressions in recipient actions,"This dissertation investigates the processes in which second language (L2) speakers of Japanese develop their interactional competence in using modal expressions (e.g., ne [I share your view], kamo [maybe]) as recipients during study abroad. Although previous research has found that beginning learners of Japanese use the acknowledging receipt soo desu ka [Is that so] at first and subsequently show agreement by saying soo desu ne [That's true], their later development of using receipts is yet to be investigated. Using conversation analysis as a theoretical and methodological approach, my dissertation addresses this heretofore unexplored research topic and also investigates the affordances of social interaction for the development of interactional competence. For the purpose of capturing the benefits of study abroad for long-term development, I collected first-encounter dyadic conversations that four study-abroad L2 speakers of Japanese participated in before and after their year in Japan, and compared them with those of four other L2 speakers who stayed at the home institution in the United States. The analyses of these conversations revealed not only early stages of development consistent with previous research findings, but also a variety of interactional works that L2 speakers accomplished through receipt use at later stages of development. Although a clear advantage of study abroad was not found, the study-abroad L2 speakers exhibited higher interactional competence in engaging in opinion-negotiation activities through the manipulation of modal expressions. I also investigated the mechanisms of learning by using multiple longitudinal case studies of the four focal L2 speakers. The analyses of the monthly casual conversations that they carried out during their one-year study abroad revealed certain interactional procedures that afforded learning, which in turn culminated in development over time. While the L2 speakers rarely received explicit corrective feedback on their misuse of receipts, their interlocutors' orientation to their recipient actions afforded them with opportunities to perform more competent actions subsequently. The L2 speakers were also able to model recipient actions after their interlocutors' in compatible sequential environments. This study thus demonstrates that conversation analysis furnishes the theoretical and methodological resources to document development over time and investigate the mechanisms of learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-interactional-competence-l2-japanese/docview/734797553/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shigematsu, Brandon Kenji",2010,Second language inner voice and identity,"This study investigates the phenomena of second language (L2, hereafter) inner voice for three Japanese-American English bilinguals who had long-term exposure to the L2 in naturalistic contexts, that is, by living and/or working or studying in the U.S. American English learners of L2 Japanese were included in the study as well, although only one of them had naturalistic exposure, the other having traveled to Japan in addition to being married to a Japanese national. Data for the study reveals how and when L2 inner voice is utilized, how it appears to develop, how it leads to shifts in identity toward the L2 languaculture, and how and when this takes place. Moreover, the study distinguishes the functions of L2 inner voice from those of L2 inner speech, although the two were found to co-exist at times, functioning interchangeably. Furthermore, the emergence of the L2 inner voice appears to be dependent on the prior development of L2 inner speech. Overall, the main function of L2 inner voice proves to be a bridging of language and cultural gaps between the L1 and L2 languaculture.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-inner-voice-identity/docview/741019051/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Diamond, Joel S.",2010,"The identity, second language, and the classroom dynamic: Participant observation in a beginning Korean as a second language classroom","The goal of this qualitative study was to explore the nexus between second language acquisition, identity, and the beginning second language classroom. Using a social constructionist framework, the study utilizes ethnographic methodology incorporating both narrative and autoethnographic elements. Specifically the author acted as a participant observer in a beginning Korean language class at an American university and enlisted seven classmates as co-participants. Through the author’s observations, participation, and interviews with the additional seven student participants, the role of identity is explored in the context of participant encounters with Korean as mediated by the classroom. The study treats identity as dynamic and socially constructed, discussing the relation between identity and second language acquisition in the classroom context, as reciprocal and evolving. The relationship is examined through the lens of various frameworks, among them various group and personal identity constructs such as self-concept, including academic self-concept, future selves, and community of practice. A number of additional themes are identified as integral, including the roles of the language class group identity, of comparisons, of resistance and agency. A final theme, an analysis of the identity concerns related to one participant’s late term withdrawal from the class, is additionally presented to shed additional light on the identity-second language-classroom nexus. The final chapter moves beyond the analysis of the classroom data presented in earlier chapters, and presents some possibilities for their application, from a teaching perspective, in the second language classroom. The study found a complex and nuanced set of relationships between identity, second language acquisition, and classroom. It demonstrates that language learning and teaching encompasses significantly more than a set of discrete points to be learned/acquired; those significant additional factors include individual learning styles and preferences, learner confidence, class group identity, communicative comfort level in using the second language, students’ previous experiences and expectations based on those experiences, and the dynamics of participation as expressed through forms of agency, including resistance. The study’s broad overall conclusion is that multiple identity-related factors are inseparable elements of the language acquisition process and therefore need to be addressed in every second language classroom.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/identity-second-language-classroom-dynamic/docview/749928145/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

The purpose of the current quantitative, correlational study was to examine the relationship between student proficiency in Spanish enrolled in elementary and intermediate level Spanish classes taught by native and nonnative Spanish instructors. An interview with adult students taught by native and nonnative Spanish instructors was conducted. The interview consisted of six questions in Spanish (see Appendix A) to determine student level of proficiency in Spanish. The findings provided support for Alternative Research Hypotheses 1 and 2. The recommendations that emerged from the study are imperative to students and instructors of foreign languages as well as administrators and future research.

"Lu, Yanbin",2010,Cognitive factors contributing to Chinese EFL learners' L2 writing performance in timed essay writing,"This study investigated cognitive factors that might influence Chinese EFL learners’ argumentative essay writing in English. The factors that were explored included English (L2) language proficiency, Chinese (L1) writing ability, genre knowledge, use of writing strategies, and working memory capacity in L1 and L2. Data were collected from 136 university students who received a battery of tests in two sessions. The tests consisted of timed essay writing tasks in L1 and L2, post-writing questionnaires for genre knowledge and use of strategies in the writing process, a timed grammaticality judgment task for L2 grammar knowledge, a receptive vocabulary test and a controlled-production vocabulary test for L2 vocabulary knowledge, and working memory span tasks in L1 and L2. Quantitative analyses using correlations, paired-samples t -test, analysis of variance and multiple regression revealed that L2 language proficiency is the most important predictor of L2 writing, followed by genre knowledge and L2 writing strategies. L1 writing ability and working memory capacity have slight impact as explanatory variables for L2 writing performance in the timed essay writing task. Index words.

"Iwai, Tomoko",2010,Becoming a good conversationalist: Conversational competence as a target of JFL instruction,"This study investigated the effects of instruction on the JFL learners’ ability to engage in small talk using an instructional approach that uses activity as a target of instruction and pragmatics-focused instruction. Small talk was selected as the target of instruction because of its function to fulfill the intrinsically human needs for sociability. The activity of small talk was operationalized for instruction in a second-semester Japanese class through the construct coined conversational competence, the ability to co-construct involved small talk that features eight pragmatic resources. The involved small talk refers to the active and willing participation by the learners with the effective use of these resources, co-constructing such social meanings as sociability and rapport as well as various stances associated with their situated and discourse identities. By placing the focus of instruction on conversational competence, the study proposed innovation for language instruction: the adoption of activity as the main target of instruction (Yoshimi, 2003, p. 9, 2008), and the use of pragmatics-focused instruction as the main instruction. The instruction provided the students with metapragmatic information about what small talk is, it’s organizational features including relevant resources, appropriate topics, and how it is jointly accomplished by participants using explicit instruction of pragmatics. The instruction aimed to foster the students’ orientation to small talk as a social activity in which participants strive to achieve sociability, building rapport and self-presentation. The instruction also provided ample opportunities for the students to practice using the resources to engage in small talk in an open-ended, unscripted, and contingent interaction, as well as feedback. The study found that the activity-based, pragmatics-focused instruction had a facilitative role in bringing about changes in the students’ participation between the two observations before and after the instruction. Students showed their orientation to small talk as a social activity and used the resources effectively to co-construct sociability, rapport, and identity in the interaction with a native speaker.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/becoming-good-conversationalist-conversational/docview/762781741/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kwak, Hye-Young",2010,Scope interpretation in first and second language acquisition: Numeral quantifiers and negation,"The present study investigates the interpretation of scopally ambiguous sentences containing a numeral quantifier and negation, such as (1) and (2), with a view to examining the interpretive preferences for Korean manifested by Korean-speaking children and adults, and the interpretive preferences for English manifested by Korean-speaking second language learners. (1) Korean Dora-ka cokay-lul twu kay an cwu-wess-ta. Dora-NOM seashell-ACC two CL NEG pick up-PST-DECL ‘Dora didn’t pick up two seashells.’ (2) English (a) Tom didn’t cut down two apple trees. (b) Two cooks didn’t taste the soup. The results from experiments on L1 Korean reveal that Korean-speaking children strongly prefer to assign the wide scope reading (i.e., the two &gt; not interpretation) to numerically quantified NP patterns in object position in sentences containing short-form negation. Korean-speaking adults also display a preference for the two &gt; not interpretation, but they tend to access the narrow scope reading of the NP patterns (i.e., the not &gt; two interpretation) more frequently than children do. The results also show that Korean-speaking children do not simply lack the not &gt; two interpretation but accept the interpretation more frequently when the test sentences are preceded by affirmative sentences carrying contrastive information that creates a context for denial. The results from experiments on L2 English show that in interpreting negative sentences containing numerically quantified subject NPs, second language learners resemble native adult speakers of English in preferring the two &gt; not interpretation. However, in the case of numerically quantified object NPs, they tend to accept the two &gt; not interpretation more frequently, in contrast to English native speakers, who do not show clear preferences. The results also show that in neither case do low and high proficiency groups show any differences in their interpretive preferences in English. The interpretive preferences manifested in L1 Korean and L2 English are discussed in the framework of O’Grady’s (2006, 2008) processor-based approach, which accounts for scope phenomena by reference to the importance of minimizing the burden on working memory in the courses of processing.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/scope-interpretation-first-second-language/docview/762998219/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Han, Ye",2010,The effect of implicit and explicit feedback: A study on the acquisition of Mandarin classifiers by Chinese heritage and non-heritage language learners,"Previous studies revealed mixed results in terms of the relative effects of implicit and explicit feedback: some found that explicit feedback worked more efficiently than implicit feedback; others found no difference between the two feedback types. These contrasting results called for further investigations into this issue, particularly examining those underexplored learner groups who have developed their target language (TL) in a different path from traditional foreign/second language learners investigated in previous studies, such as heritage language (HL) learners. Therefore the present study aims at contributing to the literature by investigating the relative effects of implicit feedback in the form of recasts and explicit feedback in the form of meta-linguistic feedback on the acquisition of Mandarin classifiers by Chinese heritage language (CHL) and non heritage language (non-CHL) learners. This study employed a pre-test-treatment-post-test research design, in which 64 participants (CHL=35, non-CHL=29) were randomly divided into four experimental groups and two control groups. Feedback was provided on learners' errors by a native Chinese interlocutor during the two treatment sessions. Learners' perceptions of feedback were measured by their verbal comments provided during the stimulated recall, and their acquisition of classifiers were assessed by their test scores. The data were both quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The results showed that both feedback types were effective in facilitating learners' acquisition. In addition, learners' language background was also found to affect their perceptions of feedback, as well as their acquisition. The findings of this study expand our knowledge about implicit and explicit feedback. In addition, they also provide invaluable information particularly for educators and administrators who are involved in HL instruction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-implicit-explicit-feedback-study-on/docview/817396545/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Cerezo Ceballos, Luis",2010,"Talking to avatars: The computer as a tutor and the incidence of learner's agency, feedback, and grammatical form in SLA","Increasingly, SLA research is exploring models of hybrid learning where computers are used not only as tools for information and communication purposes but as autonomous electronic tutors. Incipient evidence has shown that e-tutors can facilitate L2 grammar development and even supersede other instructional technologies (e.g., Nagata, 1996; Nutta, 1998; Watts, 1989). However, very few theoretical arguments have been presented to explicate these findings. Quite possibly, the edge of e-tutors may arise from their ability to engage learners in interactive practice (Nagata, 1996), while other multimedia technologies may only, at best, showcase pre-recorded interactions. According to the Interaction Hypothesis (Long, 1996), participation in interactive practice can promote SLA because it allows learners to notice, comprehend, and process input, produce output, form and revise hypotheses in response to feedback, and produce modified output, processes which have been shown to be developmentally helpful (Mackey, 2007). However, the IH does not specify whether or not the effects of these processes are determined by the type of agency of the learner; that is, whether it is necessary for learners to engage proactively in the aforementioned processes, or whether mere exposure to interactive practice by others (by e.g., watching a video) may suffice. On this note, existing empirical research is scant and contradictory, with Mackey (1999) showing a benefit for practice over exposure to it, Muranoi (2000) showing no significant differences, and Hsieh (2007) yielding mixed results. Arguably, the relative effects of learner’s agency may be moderated by the type of practice that is being performed or observed. One usual component of practice is corrective feedback, since its presence or absence draws the line between tasks for learning and testing purposes (Loschky &amp; Bley-Vroman, 1993). Hitherto, the facilitative effects of feedback have been largely validated (Li, 2010; Lyster &amp; Saito, 2010; Russell &amp; Spada, 2006). However, there is no consensus as to which type of feedback yields the largest effects. These conflicting findings may be explicated by an insufficient isolation of three components of feedback, i.e., positive evidence, negative evidence, and prompting for error repair, so research must address whether they make separate contributions to L2 grammar development (Leeman, 2002; McDonough, 2005). In the realm of CALI this issue remains unaddressed, and additionally, no study to date has explored the potential of oral (as opposed to written) feedback, thus under-exploiting the potential of computers to simulate authentic communication (Warschauer, 2004). Finally, the effects of both practice and feedback may be mediated by the type of grammatical form under instruction. However, while several studies have corroborated this, there is little research on how the difficulty of a form exerts its mediating role (DeKeyser, 2007; Ellis, 2007). Using an innovative e-tutor and a pre-test/post-test/delayed post-test design, this study empirically investigated whether intermediate-level university students of L2 Spanish (N=127) learned more grammar when given opportunities to practice or when given audiovisual exposure to others’ practice. Some engaged in computer-simulated conversations with pre-filmed real people, whereas others observed videos of those interactions. The second variable under investigation was the type of corrective feedback provided, which varied in terms of the explicitness of the negative evidence (whether the error was merely spotted or explained) and the requests for error repair (whether or not students were prompted to reformulate their ill-formed productions). The effects of agency and feedback were investigated on two different grammatical forms varying in complexity, Spanish prepositional relative clauses (easier) and present subjunctive (harder). An exit questionnaire was administered to tap into participants’ perceptions of the learning experience. Results showed that practice had beneficial effects over exposure to it only under more demanding conditions (less explicit feedback) and for one of the targeted structures (prepositional relative clauses). In terms of feedback, prompting yielded no significant effects, while the explicitness of negative evidence did, with more explicit feedback yielding better results for both structures. However, these effects were more evident for the easier form, prepositional relative clauses. In terms of learners’ perceptions, performers were significantly more satisfied than observers, and explicit feedback generated opposite reactions. From a theoretical perspective, these findings contribute to the growing SLA literature on the effects of practice and feedback, while from a pedagogical perspective they prove that computerized oral feedback can work, and help to elucidate precisely when computers may have an edge over non-interactive audiovisual media.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/talking-avatars-computer-as-tutor-incidence/docview/839881106/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Canales Viquez, Alonso Jose",2010,Acquisition of tense-aspect morphology in English by native speakers of Costa Rican Spanish: The case of simple present and present progressive,"This study investigated whether native speakers of Costa Rican Spanish are capable of acquiring a series of typical and atypical meanings associated with the English Simple Present and Present Progressive. Given the similarities between these languages, this study also explored the role of the L1 in the acquisition properties that are similar in the L2. Two tasks were implemented in order to explore this issue. A Grammaticality Judgment Task tested learners' and natives' acceptability of English sentences with simple present and progressive morphology presented in isolation while an Interpretation Task tested acceptability of the same types of sentences but in the presence of a context provided by a preceding story. The stimuli designed for these tasks were organized in three experiments. The first experiment looked at activities like Marcela writes/is writing poetry . The second experiment tested acquisition of activities with a habitual meaning as in Ana writes/is writing poetry now . The third experiment tested futurates like Carmen returns/is returning to Spain next week . The results suggest that the L1 does not seem to play an important role in the acquisition of the L2 tense-aspect morphology. However, contextual information and the presence of adverbs proved to be a key element in access to the correct interpretation of less typical meanings associated with simple present and the progressive.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-tense-aspect-morphology-english/docview/847376061/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"D'Amico, Melanie Lynn",2010,The effects of intensive study abroad and at home language programs on second language acquisition of Spanish,"This study explores the effects of short-term Spanish study in study abroad (SA) and at home (AH) contexts on oral fluency and Willingness to Communicate (WTC). Following the Input and Interaction Hypothesis and the Output Hypothesis, it is hypothesized that learners from short-term SA programs will demonstrate larger gains in fluency and WTC due to their greater interaction with native speakers and second language (L2) artifacts. Previous fluency research (Freed, 1995; Towell, 2002; Freed, So and Lazar, 2003; Isabelli-Garcia, 2003; Segalowitz and Freed, 2004; Segalowitz, Freed, Collentine, Lafford, Lazar, and Diaz-Campos, 2004; Freed, Segalowitz and Dewey, 2004; Juan-Garau and Perez-Vidal, 2007; O.Brien, Segalowitz, Freed, and Collentine, 2007) has been positive for longer-term SA programs; it is the aim of this research to add to these findings by exploring a short-term program. At the time of the current study only one investigation of WTC (Yashima and Zenuk-Nishide, 2008) has sought a possible interaction with L2 acquisition; however, a belief persists that learners who are more willing to use the L2 show more improvement linguistically. The findings of this study provide the field with empirical research about the connection between the two. Participants are 23 intermediate level students (9 in SA, 14 in AH). All are L1 English speakers and are not bilingual. Data were collected using pre- and post-program interviews, pre- and post-program questionnaires examining WTC in Spanish, a questionnaire examining WTC in English, weekly Language Contact questionnaires, and personal reflection blogs discussing WTC in Spanish. Results somewhat positively favor the SA context, showing that the SA learners improved their fluency significantly more than the AH learners. Yet when compared to AH learners who were enrolled in the same amount of credit hours fewer differences were seen. SA learners were able to show a faster rate of speech than AH learners, but no other significant differences were seen. Similarly, WTC significantly increased over time for the SA learners but not for the AH learners. Quantitative results do not reveal a correlation between WTC and higher fluency scores, although further research is needed to determine the nature of the relationship between WTC and fluency.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-intensive-study-abroad-at-home-language/docview/856603326/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Matsumoto, Kazumi",2010,A study of language style variation in Japanese: Style usage by natives and learners,"There are various language styles in speaking and writing, but early studies have given the impression that there is a simple binary distinction between speaking and writing; that is, speaking is simple and casual, while writing is dense and formal. However, in reality, various types of speaking styles and writing styles exist (e.g. Halliday, 1989). Kawagoe (1991) indicated that there is no clear distinction between the spoken and written language. Biber and Vasquez (2008) also found that, based on a large corpus study, there is no difference between the spoken and written languages. Based on a literature review, the present study assumes the spoken and written languages as not having a clear distinction. Language styles change in accordance with a number of factors as Chafe and Danielewicz (1987) proposed. This study presents six factors for language style variation: (1) time constraints, (2) modalities, (3) degree to which a response is needed from a communicational partner, (4) purpose of communication, (5) situation, and (6) attributes of interlocutors. Of these, the present study focused on two factors, modalities and purposes of communication, and investigated how L2/FL learners used their language styles according to how these variables are set by comparing L1 and L2/FL language samples through quantitative and qualitative analyses. Moreover, how L2/FL learners develop their language styles was also examined. The results indicated that these factors do indeed affect language styles. Modalities affected length, vocabulary, complexity, and subjective expressions. Purpose of communication influenced length, vocabulary, and subjective expressions in L2/FL, while in L1, vocabulary, complexity, and subjective expressions were affected. Furthermore, language proficiency affected differences between modalities in length, complexity, and subjective expression, whereas differences between the purposes were affected in terms of vocabulary, complexity, and subjective expressions. The qualitative analyses found that attitudinal resources in the recount and persuasive texts were different, and number of resources, types of resources, and the way in which these resources were employed differed among the three proficiency groups.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/study-language-style-variation-japanese-usage/docview/859003649/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Takayama, Mariko",2010,The development of writing in Japanese and English of JHL speakers and the dynamics of bilingual learning,"This study was designed to examine the development of writing proficiency in Japanese and English of JHL (Japanese as a Heritage Language) speakers, and investigate the relationship between acquiring writing skills in the two languages from the viewpoint of bilingualism. Twenty-one adults participated. Data were collected via questionnaires to obtain the participants' language background and writing samples in Japanese and English using one essay topic. The essays were analyzed quantitatively. The results confirmed Cummins' interdependence hypothesis for writing in both languages if the writers were in the additive state. Although a variety of significant correlation coefficients were observed between the categories of WE (Writing Expertise; content and organization) in Japanese and those of LP (Language Proficiency; vocabulary, grammar, and mechanics) in English, no notable relationships were seen between the same categories. The interdependence hypothesis in non-cognate languages such as Japanese and English does not work solely on the basis of surface individual linguistic knowledge.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-writing-japanese-english-jhl-speakers/docview/860141580/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Sano, Aiko",2010,Building a bridge: A case study of teaching for transfer of writing skills among Japanese-English bilingual students,"In this study ten Grade 2-3 Japanese-English bilingual students wrote compositions on the same topic in Japanese and English. The students received an intervention designed to help them improve their Japanese writing, and were asked again to write in English after that. The compositions in Japanese and English before and after the intervention were compared and examined in terms of fluency, lexical complexity, grammatical complexity and accuracy, and using holistic measures. The results showed that the fluency, lexical complexity and theme statement of the compositions were highly related across languages before the intervention. Also the intervention was observed to exert a positive effect on lexical complexity and the use of metaphor, but negatively on accuracy. All the patterns found in the quantitative data were investigated qualitatively. The thesis concludes with practical suggestions for parents and educators of bilingual students about how to support them transfer their knowledge across languages.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/building-bridge-case-study-teaching-transfer/docview/869528113/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Abe, Yuji",2009,Combining clauses by native and non-native speakers of Japanese,"This study explores how native and non-native speakers (L1 English intermediate) of Japanese combine clauses in spoken language, examines how clause-combining is presented in Japanese textbooks, and makes suggestions to teaching. It was found that native speakers tend to combine clauses but non-native speakers tend not to. Of the three ways to combine clauses, the native speakers used conjunctive suffixes the most, followed by conjunctive particles. Conjunctions were used least. The non-native speakers showed a preference for conjunctions. Most of the forms used by the non-native speakers were used by the native speakers and covered in the textbooks. The forms frequently used by the non-native speakers were used by the native speakers frequently, and were taught early. However, some of the forms which the native speakers used were not presented in the textbooks at all. Introducing clause-combining forms from the beginning and teaching important forms in the textbooks is suggested.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/combining-clauses-native-non-speakers-japanese/docview/305050936/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Fu, Jing",2011,The Influence of Gender and Culture on First and Second Language Writing of Chinese and Japanese-speaking University Students,"This study investigated the influence of gender and culture on 23 university students' first language (L1) and second language writing (L2). Specifically, the study investigated the extent to which gender differences would emerge in students' L1 and L2 writing and whether any such differences would manifest themselves differentially in L1 as opposed to L2 writing. Students represented three national groups (8 Japanese students, 7 Chinese students, and 8 Taiwanese students). The Japanese and Chinese groups received their schooling in their home countries and came to Canada for purposes of university studies. However, the Taiwanese group came to Canada during their schooling years and consequently their English academic skills were better developed than their Chinese skills. L1 and L2 writing was sampled with four different writing tasks and analyzed for patterns of lexical and rhetorical usage. Stimulated-recall interviews were conducted with each student after they had completed the four writing tasks. The goal of the interviews was to identify the metacognitive strategies the students utilized in their L1 and L2 writing. Issues related to how students' identities intersected with their L1 and L2 writing were also explored. Because the national groups are heterogeneous with respect to L1 and L2 writing experience, each group was considered as a separate case study for purposes of analysis. Exploratory cross-group analyses were carried out only to throw additional light on within-group trends. In the sample as a whole, statistical differences related to gender did not emerge. However, qualitative analysis of students' L1 writing showed a distinct gender difference within the Japanese group. Specifically, Japanese females used considerably more politeness markers in their Japanese writing in comparison to Japanese males whose L1 writing tended to be more assertive. These differences were not apparent in males' and females' L2 (English) writing. No gender differences were observed in either L1 or L2 among the Chinese and Taiwanese groups. The findings suggest that learners absorb the instruction they receive in relation to effective ways of writing in their L2 environments and are fully capable of adjusting lexical and rhetorical features from L1 norms to L2 norms. The fact that female Japanese students did not generalize the politeness features they used in Japanese to English suggests that student identities are fluid and shift according to the cultural and linguistic context.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/influence-gender-culture-on-first-second-language/docview/1352774113/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Numata, Mitsuko",2009,The effects of the use of communication and negotiation strategies on L2 acquisition,"L2 learner's use of communication strategies (CSs) has received an attention since 1970s (Faech &amp; Kasper, 1983; Tarone et al., 1983). Previous studies have focused on identification and classification of CSs, the effectiveness and teachability of CS, the uses of CSs by different proficiency levels in different tasks, and individual differences in CS use. In spite of the varieties in focus of the previous researches, no research has address whether the use of CSs affects L2 acquisition over and beyond the level of sustainment of communication. Recent studies in classroom acquisition have shown beneficial effects of negotiation during peer conversation on L2 grammar acquisition. However, previous studies in peer interaction focus primarily on how a listener's negotiation move or corrective feedback helps a speaker to repair his/her erroneous utterances. One the other hand, CS research concerns with a speaker's voluntary action to make him/her understood at the time of communication difficulty. In other words, both negotiation strategies and CSs occur in the same conversational context. Even so, no research has ever investigated the relationship between them. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationship between the use of CSs and negotiation strategies on L2 acquisition. Twenty four students enrolled in the intermediate and advance Japanese language courses are asked to engage in two types of communicative tasks, and their development of vocabulary and grammar knowledge are examined through pre- and posttests of the target linguistic items. Also, conversations during the tasks are transcribed and qualitatively analyzed to examine the pattern of CS use and the rate of successful repair moves. The results indicate that some CSs such as appeals and code switching are beneficial, with or without a negotiation move from the interlocutor, but others may be detrimental to L2 development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-use-communication-negotiation-strategies/docview/304903985/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Saalfeld, Anita Kay",2009,Stress in the beginning Spanish classroom: An instructional study,"Typologically, stress in Spanish and English is similar in that both languages have variable word stress. However, research done by Cutler (1986) and Soto-Faraco, Sebastián-Gallés, &amp; Cutler (2001) investigating the role of stress on lexical access indicates that there are psycholinguistic differences in the way that stress is processed by native speakers of English and Spanish. Specifically, Cutler (1986) showed that native English speakers do not use stress differences to access the lexicon. Soto-Faraco et al. (2001) performed a similar study with native speakers of Spanish; their results indicated that native Spanish speakers do rely on stress to access the lexicon. The importance of stress in lexical access in Spanish indicates that it may be worth teaching to beginning L2 Spanish learners. The remaining question is whether focused instruction results in improved perception of Spanish stress. The current study addresses this question. Participants were two intact classes of L1 English speakers enrolled in a six-week session of second semester Spanish, as well as a native English control group (n=8) and a native Spanish control group (n=8). One class served as the experimental group (n=15), and the other served as the control group (n=12). A pre-test was administered during the first week, and a post-test was administered during the last week of the session. In the intervening four weeks, the experimental group received short lessons and practice activities designed to improve their perception and production of Spanish stress; the control group received no specific instruction on Spanish stress and did not do any practice activities. To measure stress perception, participants completed a timed ABX stress discrimination task. A mixed-model ANOVA and accompanying post-hoc Scheffé tests revealed that both groups demonstrated significant improvement between pre-test and post-test, but there were no significant differences between groups in terms of accuracy of response. However, the experimental group did demonstrate an improvement in response time on the post-test which was significantly different from the response time of the control group, indicating that instruction may be beneficial.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/stress-beginning-spanish-classroom-instructional/docview/304894838/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nishimura, Yukiko",2008,Aspects of Japanese computer-mediated communication: Linguistic and socio-cultural perspectives,"This study discusses Japanese computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically focusing on messages sent to open-access bulletin board system (BBS) websites. It first compares quantitatively CMC language with speech and writing and finds that interjections distinguish speech from CMC and writing. CMC is distinguished from writing by uses of particles. Uses of auxiliary verbs separate the two target websites, Channel 2 and Yahoo within CMC. Based on the linguistic characterisation of the CMC language, the thesis further discusses qualitatively politeness and impoliteness behaviours in the two target BBS websites with contrasting linguistic features. This study points out that one theory of politeness proposed by Brown and Levinson (1987) can explain impolite behaviour in Channel 2, but not politeness in Yahoo, and that another theoiy proposed by Ide (1989) can explain polite behaviour in Yahoo, but not impoliteness in Channel 2. A third theory from a discursive approach proposed by Locher and Watts (2005) is shown to be capable of synthesising the two contrasting situations. In the following chapters, concepts of online community are employed to discuss politeness issues in conjunction with the sense of community. Here differences in discussion topics are found to be relevant to both the sense of community and linguistic choices of polite/impolite language, across the two target websites. Seemingly impolite behaviour in Channel 2, where users have a strong sense of community can be explained by the concept of contextual appropriateness by Watts. Underlying the topics specifically addressed in the thesis, this study also identifies the greater role played by technology in Japanese CMC than in English CMC. It fills a research gap in linguistic study on CMC language in Japanese, politeness and impoliteness research in online context as well as online community studies in Japanese cultural contexts. It is expected to contribute to understanding Japanese CMC linguistically and socio-culturally, as well as politeness and impoliteness and online community research in general.x", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/aspects-japanese-computer-mediated-communication/docview/1973936794/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Peng, Szu-Yuan",2008,"Globalism, self-identity, and motivation perceptions of Taiwanese majors in Japanese language and culture","The purpose of this study was to explore how freshman and junior students majoring in Japanese language and culture at Soochow University in Taipei, Taiwan, perceived the influences of a global view on their self-identity, ethnicity, social networks, and the place of Japan in the global society. The study survey focuses on levels of motivation to study Japanese as well as perceptions of how the world is changing. The study survey also explores perceptions of how selection of Japanese as foreign language study may relate to students' self-identity as global citizens. The study may have value to a wide variety of educators and language faculty who are interested in the emerging phenomenon of global self-identity related to motivation for multilingualism and broad cultural interfacing. Research in educational psychology has suggested that students' motivation is closely related to their self-beliefs concerning their ability and how teachers structure their classrooms. Therefore, this study investigated Taiwanese young adults' attitudes and motivation toward the major in Japanese language and the influence of globalism on motivation to study the language. This study combined both qualitative and quantitative methods to examine students' perceptions. Computation of survey item responses into composite mean scores were calculated to identify independent sample t tests on students' perspectives regarding self-identity, global world view, personality preferences, and motivation types. In general, respondents showed interest in discussing their self-identities in a global context, saw the study of Japanese language and culture as empowering them to be global citizens with enhanced resources to get good jobs and social respect, and perceived Mandarin as potentially the future dominant global language, even over English. In line with previous research, this study found that the young adult respondents were more motivated instrumentally than integratively, using Gardner's model. But, respondents were enthusiastic to be interviewed about more abstract or integrative aspects of membership in a global society. The study concluded that foreign language faculty may find an enthusiastic and willing audience for dialogue, beyond study of language mechanics and vocabulary, among young adults who are metacognitively increasingly aware of their need to be part of emerging globalism.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/globalism-self-identity-motivation-perceptions/docview/288454223/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Umeda, Mari",2008,Second language acquisition of Japanese wh -constructions,"This dissertation investigates the second language (L2) acquisition of Japanese wh-constructions by Chinese- and English-speaking learners. The focus of this study is twofold; first, it examines whether parameter resetting is possible in L2 acquisition, as both Chinese and English wh-constructions are parametrically different from Japanese wh-constructions. Second, it examines whether parameter resetting is affected by the learners' first language (L1). Not only do Chinese and English wh-constructions differ from Japanese wh-constructions, but they also differ from each other. Chinese is, like Japanese, a wh-in-situ language, while English is a wh-movement language. Chinese wh-constructions, therefore, can be said to be more similar to Japanese wh-constructions than English wh-constructions. It is investigated whether the similarity between Chinese and Japanese and dissimilarity between English and Japanese affect the course and/or the ultimate attainment in the acquisition of wh-constructions in Japanese. Fifty-two Chinese and 32 English speakers, who were at intermediate and advanced levels, as well as 12 native speakers of Japanese, took part in the study, taking tests designed to examine their interpretations of Japanese wh-phrases. The results showed that the acquisition of targetlike knowledge of Japanese wh-constructions is possible, as evidenced by some advanced learners. However, it was also found that many learners, both at the intermediate and the advanced levels, failed to interpret wh-phrases in Japanese in a targetlike way, showing no evidence of parameter resetting. The results also showed that there was no L1 difference at the intermediate level, but at the advanced level, English-speaking learners outperformed their Chinese counterparts. The present study showed that acquiring L2 wh-constructions with a different parametric value from the learners' L1 is possible, as demonstrated by some advanced learners. However, it was also found that acquiring targetlike interpretations of wh-phrases in Japanese is difficult, and that it is only after extensive exposure and attainment of high proficiency that targetlike interpretations can be achieved. The present study also demonstrated that the typological similarity between Chinese and Japanese does not play a role in the L2 acquisition of Japanese wh-constructions. An alternative view of L1 influence to account for the out-performance by English speakers is proposed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-japanese-wh/docview/304351812/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ostapenko, Olesya",2008,The acquisition of multiple <i>wh</i>-questions in Russian as a foreign language,"This dissertation investigates the nature of interlanguage (IL) grammars L1 English speakers construct when faced with L2 Russian multiple wh -questions. The L1 English and the L2 Russian differ in the range of permissible wh -questions as well as the order of wh -elements in a sentence to a great extent. Whereas only one wh -word is fronted in English, in Russian multiple wh -questions, all wh -words have to move to at least preverbal position. In addition, in contrast to English, Russian has no constraints on the order of wh -words in the sentence relative to each other. Different ordering of wh -words, in turn, results in a distinction in presupposition and focus. The data are collected from advanced English-speaking learners of Russian in three tasks addressing separate issues. In experiment 1 the subjects are to construct all possible grammatical multiple wh -questions out of set of cards each of which contains one word. In the next task the subjects are to rate the acceptability of given sentences thus providing insight into their intuitions about grammaticality of L2 Russian multiple wh -questions. The last exercise tests whether L2 learners are able to grasp the pragmatic differences in questions expressed by the order of wh -elements. The results demonstrate that IL grammars exhibit both L1-English- and L2-Russian-like multiple wh -questions. IL grammars also demonstrate patterns that are attributable to neither English nor Russian but are characteristic of other primary languages. The difference in presupposition and focus is grasped but not in a target-like manner.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-multiple-i-wh-questions-russian-as/docview/304459117/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Bohn, Mariko Tajima",2008,Educated Japanese young women's diverse linguistic and social behaviors during the Meiji and Taisho periods (1868–1926) with implications for Japanese language pedagogy,"This dissertation takes an historical perspective on so-called ""Japanese women's language"" ( joseigo/onna kotoba ) which has been widely categorized as the stereotypical female speech style in Japanese language, as antipodal to ""men's language"" ( danseigo/otoko kotoba ). In addition to this historical work, I consider current perspectives of gendered speech styles including ""Japanese women's language,"" investigating how Japanese language learners and instructors perceive these styles and how their perceptions impact upon language pedagogy. Recent micro-sociolinguistic studies, in contrast to the categorization of gendered speech styles, highlight the within-gender diversity in Japanese women's use of language, focusing particularly on the linguistic innovation associated with non-normative femininity. Moreover, recent studies with macrosociological analysis have focused on power and dominant ideology, identifying a ""Japanese women's language"" as a media product informed by the creation of a modern women's image during the Meiji government's modernization and language standardization in the early 20 th century. During the Meiji and Taisho period (1868-1926), however, what is today considered normative ""Japanese women's language"" was regarded as unconventional or innovative and was criticized as being coarse and unladylike by educators and linguistic norm-holders. Taking micro-and macro-social analyses into consideration, this dissertation reveals a discord between the Meiji educators' perceptions of young women's use of innovative language and the media representations of this language. This dissertation focuses on educated young women's real linguistic practices, and therefore takes a different approach from recent studies that have used macrosociological analysis. Specifically, this dissertation investigates educated young women's linguistic innovation and performance of non-normative femininity during the Meiji and Taisho periods (1868-1926), by analyzing their letter-writing in readers' correspondence columns of three women's magazines: Jogaku sekai 'The World of Women's Learning,' Fujin sekai 'The Women's World,' and Reijokai 'Ladies' World.' Through a linkage between micro- and macro-social analyses, this dissertation reveals that innovative language plays a significant role in educated young women's self-expressions and their construction of a subculture through friendship practices, and identifies the similarities in linguistic innovation and performance of non-normative femininity between contemporary young women and educated young women of the Meiji and Taisho periods. In addition, by comparing how innovative language is presented in novels and fiction, I propose dual functions of innovative language; as an expression of a writer's identity as a young and modern female writer, and as a yakuwari-go 'language that fits to a particular character' (Kinsui 2003), including the use of the sentence-final expressions, da wa and no yo , which have been categorized as stereotypical feminine forms in current literature. Furthermore, I present a possible process of the spread, maintenance, and transformation of the sentence-final expressions, da wa and no yo from being viewed as coarse to become the stereotypical women's language, by proposing four social factors: young women's school and dormitory life, mimicry performance, the influence of female students and their culture, and the popularity of female students' use of these forms in public. This dissertation consists of five chapters. The first chapter provides an outline and introduction of the dissertation. The second chapter looks at previous studies of Japanese language and gender, focusing on how women's use of language has been viewed in both Japanese and Western society. The third chapter is divided into two sections. The first section investigates the historical process of the formation and maintenance of linguistic and social norms by analyzing conduct books, textbooks used in co-educational elementary schools, and readers used in girls' high schools from the late eighteenth to the early part of the twentieth century. The second section examines educated young women's diverse use of language in letter-writing and social behaviors presented in three women's magazines. The fourth chapter investigates, through the use of a questionnaire, how gendered speech patterns, including stereotypical women's language, are perceived by current Japanese language learners and instructors. Based on the analysis of the findings of the questionnaire, this chapter has implications for Japanese language pedagogy. The final chapter presents a summary of this dissertation.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/educated-japanese-young-womens-diverse-linguistic/docview/304466488/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Katayama, Akiko",2008,Borderland discourses of first -year junior college English majors in Japan: A situated qualitative study,"English education in Japan has long been a site of ideological struggle. Although much concern has been expressed about the effectiveness of English education in the nation's school system, few studies have examined what actually happens in a university English classroom over an extended period of time. Furthermore, voices of Japanese EFL students have rarely been investigated in their social context. In this dissertation, I report on a longitudinal situated qualitative study of 27 first-year students who studied in an EFL program at a women's junior college. The study is guided by the theory of language socialization (Schieffelin &amp; Ochs, 1986) and Gee's concept of ""Discourses with a capital D"" (Gee, 1992, 1996, 2005). The methods included observations and videotaping of 30 sessions of an English discussion course over the course of the 2002 academic year. I also performed 27 taped group and individual interviews with the students and their native-speaker teacher. Social conditions including the bleak job market and the falling population of 18 year-olds have compelled most colleges and universities in Japan to revise their curricula, particularly their foreign language programs. Under such pressure, the junior college under investigation was tying to implement a theme-based English program that focused on social issues and English education. As a result, the English program became a contact zone (Pratt, 1991) of conflicting ideological social practices, or Discourses. The present study depicts how the first-year junior college English majors formed peer-based Discourses in the discussion course. The students developed their own tacit rules of how to look and sound like legitimate members, and the rules also implicitly regulated who would speak Japanese or English in class, when, how, and to whom. The study examined three specific make-do strategies: (1)&#xa0;A constant and strategic use of Japanese, (2)&#xa0;a Japanized accent when speaking English, and (3)&#xa0;calling the native-speaker teacher by his last name without any honorific in class. The peer-based borderland Discourses allowed the students to rewrite a demanding and pedagogically inconsistent English education program on their own terms, and to make it more meaningful for the realities of their immediate future.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/borderland-discourses-first-year-junior-college/docview/304471706/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kaneko, Emiko",2008,An analysis of oral performance by Japanese learners of English,"This research seeks to achieve two goals: (1) to illuminate the developmental course of speaking proficiency in Japanese learners of English and (2) to disclose the influence of elicitation tasks on oral performance. The data, which were excerpted from a large-scale learner spoken corpus, were objectively analyzed in terms of accuracy, fluency and complexity. One of the unique features of the present study is that the speech samples were divided into six proficiency levels (five intermediate levels and one advanced level). The reliability of this detailed classification of proficiency levels based on holistic evaluation is first established. Then, the utterances of learners at various proficiency levels are compared in an effort to identify the chief characteristics of spoken English for each level. The second goal, the analysis of task influence, involves an investigation of the interaction between proficiency level and task complexity, i.e., how learners of different proficiencies respond differentially to pedagogic tasks depending on the cognitive demands of the tasks. For this purpose, oral performances elicited by a (dynamic) narrative and a (static) picture description task are compared. The results show that learners first become able to create longer sentences and only then become more fluent. Accuracy improves at a later stage still, and syntactic complexity (i.e., the degree of subordination) evolves progressively from the Intermediate Low to Intermediate High levels. An interaction between task and proficiency level also exists: the more demanding task elicits longer and more syntactically complex sentences from higher level learners but has no effect on lower level learners. The choice of subordinate finite clauses is also influenced by the nature of the task. This set of investigations further indicates that learners temporarily go through a phase in which they create utterances that seem deviant from the predicted course of development and which defy a particular typological universal. These seem to be strategies utilized by learners to lighten the cognitive load of spontaneous speech when under the stress of second language communicative pressure. The results reported in this dissertation can be expected to have implications for foreign language pedagogy as well as for the testing of speaking proficiency.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/analysis-oral-performance-japanese-learners/docview/304486925/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Li, Yan",2008,"The negation -numerical NP interaction in non -native Chinese: UG, POS problem, and syntactic analyses","This dissertation is an investigation of the possible influence of native language English (L1), and universal grammar (UG) on the acquisition of a non-native language Chinese (L2), through an examination of how English-speaking L2 Chinese learners acquire the knowledge of the interpretation of Chinese sentences containing negation (Neg) and numerically quantified noun phrases (QNP) in object position. Two research questions are investigated: (1) Can English-speaking L2 Chinese learners overcome the Poverty-of-the-Stimulus problem and produce native-like interpretation of L2 sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position? (2) If English-speaking L2 Chinese learners do overcome the POS problem, what factors in the L2 can help them to reset the parameters? Two experiments were carried out to answer these research questions. Experiment 1 employed the methodology of Truth Value Judgment Task to test English-speaking L2 Chinese learners' interpretation of sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position. The results suggest that L1 transfer occurred in the initial state of acquisition, but the POS problem can be overcome due to the accessibility of UG to L2 learners. Experiment 2 tests predications made by syntactic analyses on second language acquisition to see whether the acquisition of the interpretation of sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position is related to the acquisition of other aspects of the Chinese language. The test results indicated that the acquisition of the correct placement of adjuncts is not the trigger helping L2 learners successfully acquire the knowledge to interpret sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position. The knowledge that Chinese numerical NPs are not free to take subject position might be regulated under the same parameters as the acquisition of the interpretation of sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position. It is concluded that both the L1 and UG may inform L2 acquisition of phenomena at the syntax-semantics interpretive interface.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/negation-numerical-np-interaction-non-native/docview/304488135/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tateyama, Yumiko",2008,Learning to request in Japanese through foreign language classroom instruction,"This study examines the effects of instructional practices on Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) learners' pragmatic competence in learning how to request in Japanese. It also investigates how instructional effects are displayed depending on the type of outcome measure (Jeon &amp; Kaya, 2006). A preliminary study, conducted prior to the main study in order to investigate strengths and weaknesses of JFL learners of different proficiency levels when requesting in Japanese, showed that the learners had difficulties with opening and closing moves, request strategies, and the sociopragmatic aspects of requesting. These findings were incorporated into the instructional materials for the main study. The participants in the main study were JFL learners enrolled in fourth-semester university-level Japanese courses. Two classes (Regular group, N=22 ) received regular explicit instruction on requests following a course syllabus, while two others (Expanded group, N=24 ) received additional pragmatics instruction. The effect of instruction was measured through four outcome measures that involved request-making situations: discourse completion task (DCT), telephone message task, role play task and video clip rating task. The data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. A significant instructional effect was revealed in the telephone and role play tasks. Moreover, the learners performed significantly better in the role play than in the telephone task, which was attributed to the presence of the interlocutor who offered repairs to ratify the learners' requestive intent or candidate understanding. This finding suggests that interactive versus non-interactive tasks might differentially affect the learning outcome. A relatively large instructional effect was found in the video task which examined the learners' metapragmatic awareness. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the number of conventionally indirect strategies in the post-test DCT, telephone and role play tasks that examined learners' use of request strategies. This suggests that instructional effects manifest in a similar manner regardless of the type of outcome measure. Overall, there was no significant difference between the groups. While learner requests became sequentially better organized in the post-test, both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic problems remained. The study contributes to the research literature on the effect of instruction on the classroom learning of L2 pragmatics.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/learning-request-japanese-through-foreign/docview/304601423/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Joo, Hye Ri",2008,Agentivity of passives and inchoatives in second language learners of English and Korean,"Second language (L2) learners' overpassivization of unaccusatives such as '*the accident was happened' have been widely investigated. One popular account claims that L2 learners lexically causativize unaccusatives and then syntactically passivize them. This study suggests an alternative possibility: Passive unaccusatives may be caused by learners' confusion in the agentivity of passives and inchoatives. This study therefore explores whether L2 learners know the distinction between passives and inchoatives in terms of agentivity. (a) The window was Broken. (passive) (b) The window broke. (inchoative) Unlike inchoatives, passives imply the agent even if not expressed in the syntax. This dissertation includes two studies: the English as a foreign language (EFL) and the Korean as a foreign language (KFL). Each study includes three experiments: a movie judgment tasks, and two written acceptability judgment tanks—one with sentences and one with question-answer mini-dialogues. The EFL study tested 148 L2 learners of English in Korea and 42 native speakers of English. In the KFL study, the participants were 117 L2 learners of Korean in the U.S. and 64 native speakers of Korean. In the movie test, participants viewed an animation with one of the context types (animate, inanimate, and no agent) and read a passive/inchoative sentence describing the movie and then judge how well the sentence describes the movie. The sentence test investigated how well the participants know that by the agent -phrases (with an animate or inanimate agent) sound natural only with passives, not inchoatives, but that by itself -phrases sound natural with only inchoatives, not passives. The Q&amp;A test examined whether passive and inchoative why -questions expect different types of answers (purpose, animate-cause, and inanimate-cause). The results of the EFL study showed that L2 learners have knowledge of constructional meanings of passives and inchoatives but did not show their knowledge when there was no agent in context given as a stimulus for conceptualization. In the KFL study, L2 learners showed native-like knowledge of the passive and the inchoative in Korean. The results suggests that L2 learners' overpassivization can be caused by their incomplete knowledge of constructional meanings.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/agentivity-passives-inchoatives-second-language/docview/304603261/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Su, Dantao",2008,"Why passivize the nonpassivizable? Conceptual space, argument structure and L1 transfer in L2 acquisition of English unaccusatives","This dissertation explores the overpassivization errors in Chinese-speaking learners' acquisition of English as a learnability problem connected with L1 and L2 acquisition of argument structure. It attributes the differences in the final state of L1 and L2 acquisition to the differences in their respective initial state of conceptual compartmentalization based on the systematic cross-linguistic comparison of English and Chinese unaccusatives in terms of their semantic class memberships, selected argument structure construction matrices and patterns of interaction between the semantic constants of verbs and of argument structure constructions in the two languages. A judgment task administrated to 750 participants at three proficiency levels consisting of 24 sampled English alternating and nonalternating unaccusatives divided into six types and placed in the transitive, passive and unaccusative construction yielded the following results: (1) Chinese-speaking learners at the very advanced stage attained near target-like usage of English unaccusatives without representation of L2-specific conceptual dimensions that constrain the compartmentalization of notions and concepts and perspective taking in event structure conceptualization; (2) The learners passivized unaccusatives without equally transitivizing them; (3) The learners passivized alternating unaccusatives to a greater extent than nonalternating unaccusatives; (4) The learners demonstrated inaccessibilty to the semantic meaning of unaccusatives and the unaccusative construction in their L1. These findings have implications for the persistence of L1-specific pattern of conceptual compartmentalization in L2 acquisition, L2 overpassivization as a result of overt marking of the semantic contrasts between unaccusatives and unergatives, L2 judgment of unaccusatives being influenced by their grammaticalness in particular constructions and the consequences of language modulization.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/why-passivize-nonpassivizable-conceptual-space/docview/304604525/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lee, Sang-Ki",2008,"Salience, frequency, and aptitude in the learning of unaccusativity in a second language: An input enhancement study","Working from the perspective of usage-based accounts of language learning (e.g., Ellis, 2008; Robinson &amp; Ellis, 2008), this dissertation examined the instructional benefits of input enhancement on the processing of the unaccusative construction in English by Korean high school students. The processing of form for learning by second language (L2) learners was expected to be affected by the roles of: types of input salience (enhancement versus flood), types of input frequency distribution (skewed versus balanced), and two aptitudinal factors (language-analytic ability and working memory capacity). One hundred fifty-four participants, randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups and two control groups, were presented with five versions of an L2 reading passage. Each experimental text contained six unaccusative verbs selected based on their corpus frequencies. Instances of the six verbs were visually highlighted in the enhancement condition, whereas they were presented in a plain text format in the flood condition. In the skewed distribution condition, happen was predominantly presented as a prototypical member. By contrast, each verb appeared twice in the balanced distribution condition. Overall token frequency of the verbs was equal in all four experimental conditions. In the fifth, control condition, the text contained no unaccusatives but delivered the same content as the experimental texts. Three equivalent, counterbalanced sections of a scaled grammaticality judgment task were administered to measure the extent of change in the students' knowledge of unaccusatives immediately as well as three weeks after the treatments. Results indicated that the participants immediately benefited from the reading materials containing the salient and frequent input instances. However, statistically significant mean differences among the three levels of the salience factor existed only between the enhancement and the control. Likewise, statistically significant mean differences among the three levels of the distribution factor existed only between the balanced distribution and the control. The treatment effects, though not generalizable, were somewhat durable with some deterioration over three weeks. While the two aptitude measures appeared to measure a distinct component of the construct well, only the analytical performances correlated weakly with the delayed judgment scores. Implications for theory and pedagogy are discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/salience-frequency-aptitude-learning/docview/304604576/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Thoms, Joshua J.",2008,Teacher -initiated talk and student oral discourse in a second language literature classroom: A sociocultural analysis,"For students studying foreign languages at the college level in the United States, developing second language (L2) speaking abilities can be a difficult task. As students progress through the sequence of foreign language coursework and continue their studies in upper-level courses that primarily focus on the teaching of literature, they often confront a number of challenges that can hinder the ongoing development of their L2 oral ability. Furthermore, instructors teaching upper-level L2 literature courses rely a great deal on whole-class discussions. Little is known about the ways in which whole-class discussions unfold between instructors and their students in L2 literature courses, and few studies have attempted to understand oral discourse in this context at a micro-level of analysis. The study employed macro- and micro-levels of analysis to understand the dynamics of teacher-initiated whole-class discussions in a college-level Latin American literature classroom from a sociocultural theoretical perspective while also drawing on ecological linguistic views of language learning. Macro-level views of discourse included an analysis of the instructor's and students' goals, expectations, and intentions regarding the course. Micro-level views of talk focused on the linguistic structures that emerged in classroom talk. The results indicate that both the instructor and her students entered the course with a wide range of course goals and expectations. The resulting tensions between instructor and student goals influenced the interaction patterns observed in the data. Analysis also revealed that interaction-response-feedback patterns were more present when compared to interaction-response-evaluation patterns. Micro-level analysis revealed that meaning was made via affordances that emerged in the talk. Three distinct discourse patterns in the talk, termed affordance structures, were identified to mitigate the conflicting goals indicated by the instructor and her students. This study's results deepen our understanding of microgenesis via the affordance construct.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/teacher-initiated-talk-student-oral-discourse/docview/304607906/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kahn, Gabrielle",2008,"The social unfolding of task, discourse, and *development in the second language classroom","Studies on tasks for second language learners have often promoted task types that are highly structured and designed to elicit particular interactional devices. Less explored have been tasks designed with open-ended outcomes, analyzed qualitatively, and implemented in classrooms as opposed to experimental settings. This study examines the language arising from open tasks—tasks designed to unfold by learners and teacher in emergent directions—in a low-level English as a Second Language classroom of adult learners. The central purpose is to discover what dialogic phenomena characterize the discourse arising from open tasks and what relation these phenomena have to second language development. Approximately 20 hours of open task discourse were audiotaped over an eight-week period in both teacher-fronted and small-group interactions. Data were transcribed according to conversation analysis conventions and qualitatively examined through the analytical lens of sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 1978). Three central dialogic phenomena were inductively identified in the open task corpus: (1) emergent form foci, (2) complex negotiation of meaning, and (3) imitation. Dialogic phenomena were analyzed in the open task participation of two different learners as they attended to two different language structures over time—one learner with a syntactic structure (WH-question formation), and the other learner with a discourse structure (narrative formation). The study detailed the participants' negotiation of intersubjectivity in their discourse. Learners were found to expose their thinking and their developmental needs in the open space of their tasks, with their teacher and peers found to reach out with tailored support to build new knowledge and shared activity goals. The findings of this study suggest that: (1) learners' linguistic activity can open a window into their cognitive activity, (2) an open-ended task structure with both teacher and learners participating can set in motion a dynamic interactive process through which the social unfolding of learning can occur, (3) the internalization of new knowledge is a gradual process, and (4) imitative, experimental utterances exhibited during the unbounded tasks of this investigation provide evidence of second language development in process.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/social-unfolding-task-discourse-development/docview/304624443/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Seo, Mi-Suk",2008,A conversation -analytic study of repair practices in one -on -one ESL tutoring,"Using a conversation analytic methodology, this study focuses on interactional practices called ""repair,"" which address a wide range of problems in speaking, hearing, and understanding talk-in-interaction. More specifically, it examines how tutors and tutees use repair practices to deal with the tutees' linguistic troubles or errors in one-on-one ESL tutoring sessions. It investigates how these repair practices are used in a way that manifests the participants' orientation for L2 teaching and learning and how they are different from those in other L2 interactional settings. It also explores how the repair practices are coordinated with gesture. The investigation of the instances of repair in my data set shows that the tutees often initiate repair on their own talk by engaging in searches for syntactic features as well as searches for words and phrases and solicit their tutors' assistance by using various interactional resources. In these instances, the tutees invoke the tutors' linguistic expertise as relevant in resolving their troubles, and the tutors respond in a way that displays their pedagogical orientations. In the cases of tutors' repair initiation on their tutees' linguistic troubles or problems, they initiate repair both for communicative reasons and for pedagogical purposes. In each case, the tutors' repair (initiation) often results in unique interactional trajectories, such as the participants' revisit to the trouble source after the completion of the current sequence or an occurrence of another repair sequence due to the tutees' misunderstanding of the tutors' repair initiation. Also, the tutors are found to respond differently to the tutees' linguistics errors when they are produced in the first pair part of an adjacency pair, which requires certain types of responsive actions. In terms of coordination between repair and gesture, gestures are often used in the tutees' word searches in their efforts to fill in the lexical gaps and to elicit the sought-for-items from the tutors. During the word searches, the tutees sometimes produce verbal solutions that do not match their concurrent gestures, and it engenders the tutors' corrective feedback. In addition, gestures are used as repair initiators, signaling problems in understanding or hearing the prior talk, and these gestures result in the original speakers' linguistic modifications of their prior utterances. Finally, gestures are found to be salient interactional resources in repair completion. When their recipients initiate repair on their prior utterances, the tutors and the tutees sometimes add gestures or revise their prior gestures, while repeating the same utterances. Overall, repair sequences in ESL tutoring provide important clues in understanding the distinctive organization of ESL tutoring as a specific speech event. They constitute critical sequential environments in which the institutional goals of the speech event (i.e., L2 teaching and learning) become more demonstrably oriented to and more actively pursued by the participants.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/conversation-analytic-study-repair-practices-one/docview/304628068/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shirakawa, Rie",2008,Politeness in conversation between native and non-native Japanese speakers in a first-meeting context,"In order examine how advanced learners of Japanese realize the Japanese honorific system in an actual conversation, the present study focuses on their use of polite and non-polite forms. The study aims at exploring the actual effect of these usages by learners, but not limited to viewing them from a traditional perspective, which emphasizes the level of politeness at a sentence level, but by investigating characteristic discourse features in Japanese such as speech level. The study employs a case study methodology within a qualitative research framework. The participants, who are advanced learners of Japanese, conversed with a native Japanese speaker who is a stranger to them. Results from the study show deviations from the Japanese norm, but they also suggest that learners may have their own value system and employ it in conversation with Japanese. Some implications for cross-cultural communication and language teaching are drawn from these findings.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/politeness-conversation-between-native-non/docview/304662177/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Dehart, Jerold A.",2008,Visual text support for Japanese second language thesis writers,"This dissertation describes an instructional methodology that incorporates visuals and visual learning to support students at a Japanese university who were acquiring English as a second language (ESL) and were required to write a thesis in English. Recognizing that the ESL students at this university were still developing English language skills and that Japanese people have a preference for visual learning (Reid, 1987), an action research team of faculty and supervisors came together to develop visual text support for Japanese second language learners. Using Paivio's (1971) dual coding theory to explain thesis writing, a visually augmented thesis writing textbook was designed. This action research project describes the action research process of the development of the textbook and includes responses of faculty, supervisors, and students in the initial pilot of the textbook. Future research is recommended to complete this action research project and to initiate further research to deepen understanding of visual text support for English-language learners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/visual-text-support-japanese-second-language/docview/304822515/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Martinovic-Zic, Aida",2009,Tense or Aspect?: Effects of L1 Tense/ Aspect Prominence in L2 Acquisition,"This study introduces a typological model of the conceptual language-specific approach to the L2 research on the acquisition of tense-aspect. The model is based on the typological notion of prominence, classifying languages into tense-prominent and aspect-prominent (Bhat 1999) and the L1 research proposal that language-specific lexicalization patterns have a role in shaping form-function mappings in child language (Berman and Slobin 1994, Slobin 1991, 1996a, 1996b). The study represents an attempt to investigate language-specific L1 effects (Odlin 2005) in the L2 acquisition of complex form-function grammatical domains, such as tense-aspect. The most influential L2 tense-aspect research has focused on the acquisition of verb morphology (form-to-function analysis) and the acquisition of temporality (function-to-form analysis, respectively (Bardovi-Harlig 2000). The research investigated the Aspect Hypothesis (Andersen 1991, Andersen and Shirai 1994, Bardovi-Harlig 1992), the Discourse Hypothesis (Bardovi-Harlig 1995), and the Prototype Hypothesis (Shirai 1991, Li and Shirai 2000). Based on Vendler (1967), these studies explore the L2 acquisition of inherent verb aspect in comparison to grammatical aspect and tense. L2 research on specific L1/L2 contexts has not been of major interests to the L2 scholars. Turning to the specific L1/L2 features of tense-aspect prominence and aspect-prominence, this bi-directional study tests the Grammatical Domain Hypothesis (GDH) with two groups of intermediate--high intermediate instructed L2 learners: L1 English (tense-prominent)/L2 Russian (N=21) and L1 Russian (aspect-prominent/L2 English (N= 11). The L2 data were elicited on two written tasks: a cloze task and a Frog Story task, with the native speaker responses as the baseline for both tasks. The results are categorized as follows: target/non-target use of tense-aspect (task 1); non-target morphological forms, tense-aspect substitutions, lexical aspectual means, and idiosyncratic clausal strategies (task 2). The findings reveal L2 tendencies supporting the GDH: L1 English/L2 Russian learners show 'tense bias', while limiting the aspectual choices. Conversely, L1 Russian/L2 English learners show 'aspect bias' while inconsistently mixing L2 tenses. Potential methodological and interpretation problems are presented in the conclusion, followed by the pedagogical implications the study may have on the instructional methods in teaching tense-aspect to L2 learners from the typologically mismatching L1's.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/tense-aspect-effects-l1-prominence-l2-acquisition/docview/1984613849/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"James, Brian Gleason",2009,Effects of Multimedia Glossary Annotations on Incidental Vocabulary Acquisition in L2 Learners of Japanese,"In recent years, advances in computer technology have allowed increasingly rich multimedia content to be incorporated into educational materials in many fields, including the field of language teaching. Yet as visually appealing as such products may be, we must ask whether multimedia-enriched materials actually improve learning in a measurable way. If so, individual curriculum makers can then decide whether the benefits of the multimedia materials justify the cost of purchasing and implementing them. This study attempted to examine the effects of multimedia glossary aids on incidental vocabulary acquisition rates of L2 learners of Japanese. Subjects included 35 third- and fourth-year students of Japanese at a large private university in the United States, who read a Japanese short story using an online web application that included a multimedia-enriched glossary. A total of 27 keywords were selected from the text for inclusion in the glossary. A third were annotated with English text definitions only; another third had an English text definition plus a picture illustration; the final third had an English text definition plus a video illustration. An unannounced post-test measured vocabulary gains. A logistic mixed models regression was performed to test for differences in acquisition rate across the annotation types. Also, due to the unique dual nature of Japanese orthography, which includes both the phonemic kana and so-called ideographic kanji characters, the regression also examined interaction between orthographic representation of the keyword and annotation type on acquisition rate. A significant result (p&lt;0.0001) was found for annotation type as a main effect, with video-annotated words showing the highest acquisition rates. Additionally, a significant interaction (p=0.0139) was observed between orthography and annotation type, indicating that multimedia glossary annotations may have affected the acquisition of phonemic kana representations of keywords differently than they affected ideographic kanji representations.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-multimedia-glossary-annotations-on/docview/2536779988/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Reynolds-Case, Stacy Anne",2009,Pedagogical Discourse Styles of Native and Non-Native Language Teachers,"This study seeks to uncover the characteristics of foreign language instructors’ discourse styles implemented in the classroom when teaching students the target language. Foreign language classrooms are unique to academia because the teachers of the language, depending on whether they are native or non-native speakers of the target language, learned it in different environments and for distinct purposes. Many of the previous studies examining the effect a teacher’s ability in the target language will have on his/her instruction have focused on native and non-native speakers’ teaching styles and/or methodologies. Rather than the effect on the teacher’s style, the central question in this dissertation is how an instructor’s native or non-native ability will affect his/her pedagogical discourse when presenting the target language to students. Through the analysis of data collected from university classrooms with native and non-native instructors, three salient variances in the instructors’ teaching discourse are revealed: the effect the L1 of the students has in presenting the L2, the pronouns used to address students and refer to speakers of the target language and the students’ native language, and the positioning and quantity of code-switching implemented in the classes. Due to the non-native instructors sharing the same L1 as their students, they have an advantage of identifying the learning process of their students. Furthermore, non-native instructors build solidarity with their students by consistently using the first person plural pronoun when comparing the forms and cultures of their and the students’ L1 to the forms and cultures of the target language. Code-switching in the classroom room is unique and different from that which is heard in speech communities. Contributing to previous literature on classroom code-switching, the present study reveals two significant motivations behind the instructors’ code-switching: a pedagogical tool and topic expansion. From the results revealed in this study, the non-native speakers are more pedagogically prepared to recognize their students’ progress in the acquisition of the target language and to answer questions their students have about the target language. These results further aid in the preparation of language teachers in order to improve the overall outcome of future language students.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/pedagogical-discourse-styles-native-non-language/docview/2675222689/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Taniguchi, Sumiko",2009,Becoming Bilingual: Exploring Language and Literacy Learning Through the Lens of Narrative,"In this thesis, I investigate the nature of change that two adult language learners/users have experienced in learning to become bilingual through the mediation of autobiographical narrative writing. The major purposes of the thesis are to identify the nature of change that adult language learners/users have experienced in learning and using plural languages through the mediation of autobiographical writing in L2, and to examine the usefulness of narrative inquiry as a complementary research approach to understand the complexity of language and literacy learning from the learner‘s perspectives. To this end the following research questions have been posed. 1. What can learners‘ stories tell about the long-term processes of language and literacy learning? 2. What role can written autobiographical narrative play in processes of language learning? 3. What is the potential contribution of narrative inquiry to research in the field of language and literacy learning? In addressing these questions, I have drawn on socio-cultural and narrative theory to undertake a longitudinal study of two language learners/users – Satoko, a young Chinese-Japanese woman, and myself. Thus, the study comprises Satoko‘s biographical study and my own autobiographical study, in which I am simultaneously the subject and the object of inquiry. I have analysed how processes of becoming bilingual for both of us were represented in autobiographical narratives, and, in turn, how the act of writing autobiographical narratives mediated ways in which we learned to become bilingual. By utilising narrative inquiry, I have attempted to broaden the locus of research into language and literacy learning from language development to learner development. A feature of the research design implemented in the thesis is its layered approach to narrative construction and analysis. This approach has enabled me to provide detailed insights into the complex interrelationships between linguistic and non-linguistic dimensions of language learning. In particular it has enabled me to highlight the multifaceted nature of learners‘ change and the significance of affect, social relations, and transformation of identities as learners work between two languages. It has also enabled me to address ways in which learners‘ engagement with written narrative impacted both their linguistic and non-linguistic development. Outcomes from the research suggest that complex processes of language and literacy learning can be profitably examined through the notion of becoming bilingual, which entails continuous translation across languages – hence the use of the term becoming bilingual in the title of this thesis.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/becoming-bilingual-exploring-language-literacy/docview/3039731806/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Xu, Yi",2009,"The syntax, processing and second language acquisition of Chinese relative clauses","The structural complexity and the typological universals associated with relative clauses (RCs) have made the structure particularly interesting to linguists and second language acquisition (SLA) researchers. Currently, much controversy is found in RCs in East Asian Languages. This dissertation tests the syntactic status of ""relative clauses"" in Chinese and explores second language (L2) learners' processing and production of different types of Chinese RCs. In the theoretical part of the dissertation, I test whether Comrie (2002)'s proposal of analyzing putative relative clauses in East Asian languages as ""attributive clauses"" can be applicable to Chinese. From a review of syntactic literature and movement test, I argue that there are crucial differences between Chinese RCs and attributive clauses. Further, reconstruction effect suggests that A-bar movement takes place within gapped Chinese RCs. More specifically, following Sauerland (2000)'s proposal, I suggest that the derivation of Chinese RCs involves the movement of an operator taking a complex NP as its complement to the Spec of CP, and that complex NP matches with an external head outside the RC. Further, I examine the possibility of analyzing AdjP+DE structure as relative clauses, and examine the flexibility and effect of demonstrative and numeral-classifier positions and their relation with relative clauses. In the experiment chapter, I discuss results from three experiments that tested the relative degrees of difficulty for L2 learners among different types of RCs including Subject, Direct Object, Indirect Object and Object of Preposition relative clauses, I seek plausible linguistic and psycholinguistic proposals in explaining the performance data. The experiments include a self-paced word order judgment task, a written sentence completion task, and a written sentence combination task. It was found that the L2 acquisition of Chinese RCs is generally consistent with the Noun Phrase Accessibility Hierarchy (Keenan &amp; Comrie, 1977), a typological generalization based on natural languages and a hierarchy that was found to be predictive of learners’ order of acquisition in SLA studies of many other languages.

"Tomiyama, Yoshiko",2009,Progress in acquisition of Japanese discourse structures from intermediate to advanced level learners,"Although there have been many studies examining the acquisition of grammar in Japanese as a second language (L2) (e.g., Nagatomo, 1993; Noda, Sakoda, Shibuya, &amp; Kobayashi, 2001), discourse analysis research on the L2 acquisition of Japanese discourse structure is still in its infancy. This study examines how L2 learners organize their spoken discourse, and how spoken discourse by learners of Japanese changes as they develop proficiency, from intermediate to advanced levels, using interview and casual conversation data. The study found that although mid-intermediate learners used zero referential forms with ease, they still had difficulty effectively utilizing pronouns and demonstratives to refer to the preceding context. In contrast, high-intermediate learners showed an increase in the utilization of both demonstratives and pronouns. As for personal referents, omitting personal referential forms was easily employed by the intermediate level of Japanese, and the use of zero personal referential forms increased as at higher proficiencies. In addition, the study revealed that 'sentences without subjects' and 'full sentences' were the two most frequently used structures analyzed in the casual conversation data. Also, with higher proficiency, full sentences decreased while sentences without subjects increased. Furthermore, the results showed that the higher the learners' proficiency was, the more frequently they used postposing, a specific feature in spoken Japanese. Different types of postposing were used depending on the learner's proficiency level. In sum, there were gradual shifts in use of the referential forms and discourse structures depending on the learner's proficiency.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/progress-acquisition-japanese-discourse/docview/304849840/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ishida, Kazutoh",2009,Indexing stance in interaction: A pedagogical approach to teaching the pragmatic use of the Japanese plain and <i>desu/masu</i> forms,"This study is concerned with Japanese learners' pragmatic development of their understanding and use of the Japanese plain and desu/masu forms. Drawing on the notion of indexicality (Silverstein, 1976; Ochs, 1993a), studies such as Cook (1999) and Okamoto (1998) analyze naturally occurring interactions between Japanese native speakers (NSs) and reveal how they utilize the forms as resources to manage their affective stance in relation to various contextual features. Given that the forms are basic linguistic tools in Japanese for self-expression and relationship building, I argue that teaching the pragmatic functions of the forms cannot and should not be ignored in the early stages of instruction. In this study, I propose an instructional approach to facilitate beginning-level learners' development of pragmatic competence in understanding and using the forms. The approach incorporates awareness-raising and communicative practice components based on findings from previous interventional studies (e.g., Tateyama, 2001; Yoshimi, 2001). In conceptualizing these components and the learning which the approach intends to facilitate, this study draws on the notion of language socialization (Ochs, 1996; Ochs &amp; Schieffelin, 2008). Awareness-raising discussions are considered explicit socialization opportunities for learners to develop understanding of the use of the forms in pragmatically appropriate ways. Conversation sessions with Japanese NSs constitute opportunities for implicit socialization in which learners can assess the indexical meanings of the forms and make informed decisions about using them in interaction. The approach was implemented in two consecutive first-year JFL courses. Twenty learners were enrolled in the experimental courses. To examine the effect of the approach, data were collected from experimental and control groups through (a) questionnaires in which learners assess the appropriateness of the forms, (b) transcriptions of the conversation sessions, and (c) reflection sheets filled out after each conversation session. Analyses of the questionnaires and reflection sheets are consistent in revealing the experimental group learners' deeper understanding of the indexical use of the forms. Moreover, analysis of the conversations shows expanded use of the forms by the experimental group learners with increased attention to a wider range of contextual features.

PCR is essentially an inductive approach to facilitating awareness of how language forms are used appropriately in a given context. Regarding consciousness-raising, Schmidt (1990, 1993, 1994, 1995, 2001) has proposed his noticing hypothesis that no learning can occur without awareness. Therefore, the study explores the question of whether there can be learning without awareness. A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest format (immediate and delayed) was adopted. Forty-one JFL learners participated in this study. They were undergraduate and graduate students in the US. The JFL learners were divided into two groups: the PCR treatment group and the control group. The pretests were administered one day prior to the treatment sessions. The tests consist of two metapragmatic knowledge tests and an oral discourse production test. In total, four experimental sessions (30 minutes per session) were given to the PCR group. During the treatment sessions, the JFL learners in the PCR group first compared hearsay reports in L1 English and L1 Japanese, and then compared hearsay reports in L 1 Japanese and L2 Japanese. After the treatment periods were over, the learners in both groups were asked to complete immediate posttests. Lastly, one month after the treatment sessions, both groups took delayed posttests. The JFL learners in the PCR activities performed both the immediate posttests and the delayed posttests better than the control group. These results indicate that it may be effective for JFL learners to learn the features of hearsay evidential markers in Japanese through discourse analysis and become able to use hearsay expressions in a native Japanese-like manner. With regard to the feedback from the PCR participants, some students provided positive feedback on the analysis exercises using natural discourse data. They commented that it is always good to read more real examples that do not come from a textbook. Through the PCR activities, L2 learners may be made aware of critical differences between L1 and L2 pragmatics.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-pragmatic-consciousness-raising/docview/304894594/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ivanov, Ivan Prodanov",2009,Second language acquisition of Bulgarian object clitics: A test case for the Interface Hypothesis,"The primary objective of this dissertation is to expand the testing ground of the Interface Hypothesis, which states that interface properties involving the syntax and other cognitive domains (such as discourse) may trigger residual optionality effects at the end-state. The target of investigation were Bulgarian object clitics whose syntactic and discursive properties provide a good testing ground for theoretical approaches to second language acquisition. Ten advanced and 14 intermediate L2 speakers of Bulgarian, as well as a control group of Bulgarian native speakers, participated in the study. The test materials included a proficiency test, a grammaticality judgment task to check syntactic knowledge of clitics, and a pragmatic felicity task. The latter was aimed at investigating the degree to which L2 learners of Bulgarian, with English as their L1, had acquired a syntax-discourse interface property of Bulgarian, namely the pragmatic function of clitic doubling. In Bulgarian, clitic doubling serves as an overt marker of topicality and ‘undoubled’ object topics are deemed infelicitous. The results of the experiments in this dissertation present a challenge to some theoretical approaches to second language acquisition, namely the Interpretability Hypothesis and the Interface Hypothesis. The results showed that the intermediate participants did not differentiate between the felicitous and the infelicitous options in the pragmatic felicity task in a target-like manner as their responses either did not exhibit statistically significant difference or favored the response closest to the L1. However, the advanced L2 learners of Bulgarian had successfully acquired the syntax of clitics as well as the pragmatic meaning of clitic doubling in Bulgarian. They displayed target-like convergence with respect to the syntactic properties of Bulgarian object clitics and distinguished between the felicitous and the infelicitous options in the pragmatic task in a native-like manner. The study highlights the fact that successful learning at the syntax-discourse interface cannot be excluded and a lot more research, exploring as many interface conditions as possible, needs to be done in order to validate the Interface Hypothesis as a legitimate constraint which permanently hinders native-like performance.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-bulgarian-object/docview/304900096/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Brown, Amanda",2007,Crosslinguistic influence in first and second languages convergence in speech and gesture,"Research on second language acquisition typically focuses on how a first language (L1) influences a second language (L2) in different linguistic domains and across modalities. This dissertation, in contrast, explores interactions between languages in the mind of a language learner by asking (1)&#xa0;can an emerging L2 influence an established L1? (2)&#xa0;if so, how is such influence realized? (3)&#xa0;are there parallel influences of the Ll on the L2? These questions were investigated for the expression of Manner (e.g. climb, roll) and Path (e.g. up, down) of motion, areas where substantial crosslinguistic differences exist in speech and co-speech gesture. Japanese and English are typologically distinct in this domain; therefore, narrative descriptions of four motion events were elicited from monolingual Japanese speakers (n=16), monolingual English speakers (n=13), and native Japanese speakers with intermediate knowledge of English (narratives elicited in both their L1 and L2, n=28). Ways in which Path and Manner were expressed at the lexical, syntactic, and gestural levels were analyzed in monolingual and non-monolingual production. Results suggest mutual crosslinguistic influences. In their L1, native Japanese speakers with knowledge of English displayed both Japanese- and English-like use of morphosyntactic elements to express Path and Manner (i.e. a combination of verbs and other constructions). Consequently, non-monolingual L1 discourse contained significantly more Path expressions per clause, with significantly greater mention of Goal of motion than monolingual Japanese and English discourse. Furthermore, the gestures of non-monolingual speakers diverged from their monolingual counterparts with differences in depiction of Manner and gesture perspective (character versus observer). Importantly, non-monolingual production in the L1 was not ungrammatical, but simply reflected altered preferences. As for L2 production, many effects of L1 influence were seen, crucially in areas parallel to those described above. Overall, production by native Japanese speakers who knew English differed from that of monolingual Japanese and English speakers. But L1 and L2 production within non-monolingual individuals was similar. These findings imply a convergence of L1-L2 linguistic systems within the mind of a language learner. Theoretical and methodological implications for SLA research and language assessment with respect to the 'native speaker standard language' are discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/crosslinguistic-influence-first-second-languages/docview/304897333/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Schwartzman, Junko Ikeda",2011,"Learners' use, perception, and recognition of and motivation to learn Japanese gender forms","The present study investigated Japanese learners' use, perception, and recognition of and motivation to learn Japanese gender forms. Although native speakers of Japanese use the gender forms, often in casual conversations, to create solidarity, communicate more effectively, and make relationships to one another closer (McGloin, 1997), learners tend to use the gender forms only infrequently (Asada, 1998). Considering learners' inability to use the gender forms, researchers claim that the gender forms need to be taught more in class (Ishida, 2009; Kakegawa, 2009). However, before teaching the gender forms, which could be a controversial topic for some learners, teachers should know how much knowledge, understanding, and motivations learners have regarding the gender forms (Thomson &amp; Iida, 2002). In the present study, an online survey was distributed to Japanese learners in the US to measure their use, perception, recognition of, and motivation to learn Japanese gender forms. A total number of 110 subjects responded to the survey and the data were analyzed statistically. The study found that 1) learners frequently used the gender forms ka, no, sake, umai, but they used ze and kashira only infrequently; 2) they tended to perceive male forms used by a female speaker as ruder than when used by a male speaker; 3) they recognized ze, kashira, no, osake, and oishii correctly; 4) their levels of Japanese, time spent in Japan, and contact with Japanese native speakers affected their recognition of the gender forms ze, ka, kashira and umai ; 5) the majority of the learners were very motivated to learn Japanese gender forms; 6) some learners considered the gender forms as sex discrimination, but most of them were still motivated to learn the gender forms; and 7) about half of the learners felt that to learn the gender forms solely for the purpose of being able to recognize them is enough and did not feel it necessary to use them. The present study suggests that teachers should not just teach the gender forms in a top-down fashion but must understand learners' needs and awareness of Japanese gender forms first. Designing a class that does not force students to speak in a stereotypical way, but exposes them to various models and has them make their own choices of speech styles, would be beneficial.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/learners-use-perception-recognition-motivation/docview/1841914188/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Matsushita, Hitokazu",2011,Computerized Oral Proficiency Test for Japanese: Measuring L2 Speaking Ability with ASR Technology,"Developing a time- and cost-efficient method for second language (L2) oral proficiency measurement is one of the research topics that has attracted much attention in recent decades. The purpose of this study is to develop a computerized oral testing system for L2 Japanese using automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology. Two testing methods called elicited imitation (EI) and simulated speech (SS) are proposed to quantify L2 accuracy and fluency via ASR processing. This study also suggests systematic EI item creation leveraging corpus technology and discusses the effectiveness of the test items created through analyses of item difficulty. Further, refinement of the EI grading system is described through a series of statistical investigations. For SS, this study reports the five most influential L2 fluency features identified through machine learning and proposes a method to yield individual SS scores with these features based on previous studies. Lastly, several methods to combine the EI and SS scores are presented to estimate L2 oral proficiency of Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/computerized-oral-proficiency-test-japanese/docview/2548932151/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Bonilla, Carrie L.",2012,Testing Processability Theory in L2 Spanish: Can readiness or markedness predict development?,"The goal of this dissertation is to test the five stages of Processability Theory (PT) for second language (L2) learners of Spanish and investigate how instruction can facilitate the development through the stages. PT details five fixed stages in the acquisition of L2 morphosyntax based on principles of speech processing (Levelt, 1989) and modeled on Lexical- Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan &amp; Bresnan, 1982; Bresnan, 2001). In addition, two models that predict how instruction can affect staged language development are tested: the Teachability Hypothesis (Pienemann, 1984, 1989), which says that instruction will only be effective if aimed at the next developmental stage and Projection Model (Zobl, 1983, 1985), which claims that instruction on more marked items can project to less marked, related items. In Study 1, the specific stages for L2 Spanish morphology and syntax were proposed and tested on a cross-sectional corpus of conversational data by learners ( n =21) with L1 English. Implicational scaling confirmed the five stages for the syntax and morphology with 100% scalability. Syntax was also found to emerge before morphology at all five stages. Studies 2 and 3 tested the effect of instruction aimed at Stages 3, 4 and 5 for beginning (first and second semester) learners of Spanish ( N=57 ). Learners' oral production and stage gains were measured between a pre-test, a post-test two days after instruction, and a delayed post-test three weeks later. Learners' production of the target structures increased after instruction on the next, next + 1 or next + 2 stages, while the control groups made no significant changes. These results present counter-evidence to the prediction of the Teachability Hypothesis that instruction only on the next stage can aid learners to advance to subsequent developmental stages. Overall, the results offer further cross-linguistic support for the PT hierarchy, while refuting one of its corollaries, the Teachability Hypothesis.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/testing-processability-theory-l2-spanish-can/docview/1080529479/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Katayama, Akemi",2012,Effects of Instruction on Japanese Discourse Marker <i>N Desu</i>,"The present study investigated the effects of explicit and implicit instruction on the acquisition of pragmatic knowledge of the Japanese discourse markers n desu and its variant n desu ka. The study employed a quasi-experimental design with pre-, post-, and delayed posttests. The explicit group received instruction including explanations about when the discourse markers are used or not used. The implicit group received instruction that lacked this explanation and requested participants to discover the pragmatic rules of the discourse markers. The results of a discourse completion posttest showed that both explicit and implicit instruction had an immediate positive effect on learning of the target pragmatic features. However, this positive effect did not last until the time of a delayed posttest. The study also found no significant differential effects between explicit and implicit instruction. In addition, the effects of instruction varied depending on the functions of the discourse markers.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-instruction-on-japanese-discourse-marker/docview/1197858493/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Cunningham, Dana Aliel",2012,Investigating holistic measures of speech prosody,"Speech prosody is a multi-faceted dimension of speech which can be measured and analyzed in a variety of ways. In this study, the speech prosody of Mandarin L1 speakers, English L2 speakers, and English L1 speakers was assessed by trained raters who listened to sound clips of the speakers responding to a graph prompt and reading a short passage. In order to eliminate other factors that might distract from assessing only the prosodic `goodness' of a given speaker, the sound clips were acoustically filtered to attenuate all frequencies 500 Hz and above. This cut-off was used with the aim of preserving prosodic characteristics without including interference from segmental features where possible. The raters who participated in this study were trained to use the OEPT (Oral English Proficiency Test) scale to rate holistic speech in an unfiltered condition so this study employs an adapted version of that scale. The levels of the adapted scale were as follows: (1) – L1 Mandarin Prosody, (3) L2 Novice English Prosody, (5) L2 Intermediate English Prosody, (7) Advanced English Prosody, (9) L1 English Prosody. For each sound clip, the raters were asked to assign one of these proficiency levels and describe in qualitative terms why they choose that score. EFL students from different universities in China were also asked to complete this task of rating filtered speech along the same scale. The resulting analysis will examine the usefulness of rating prosody through filtered speech for L2 prosody assessment as well as its potential benefits for prosody pedagogical development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigating-holistic-measures-speech-prosody/docview/1235763869/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shin, Eun Young",2012,The Availability of Semantic and Syntactic Information and their Use as a Structural Predictor in the Real-Time Processing of L1 and L2 Korean,"The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the real-time sentence processing of Korean both by native speakers and learners in terms of the availability and the effectiveness of different types of information in the structural prediction. Built on the crosslinguistically contrastive findings between Japanese in Yoshida (2006) and Chinese in Hsu (2007), the parser in Korean is characterized in two aspects. The first aspect is whether the parser is sensitive to different types of information in on-line processing such as the semantic mismatch and the case markers. The second aspect is whether the parser makes a structural prediction based on inherently indirect cues available. In addition, the L2 parser from two language backgrounds is qualitatively compared in the same aspects. Self-paced reading time experiments were conducted with L1 Korean speakers as well as L1 Japanese and L1 English learners of Korean. The construction under discussion contained a classifier construction and the relative clause, where the semantic match between a classifier and its closest candidate licensing noun as well as the case marker of the noun was manipulated. The results showed that both L1 and L2 parsers were sensitive to the available semantic information as well as the case marker information in on-line processing. The semantic mismatch had an immediate impact while the case marker information exhibited a latent effect. As for the prediction effect, the semantic mismatch alone did not serve as an unfailing predictor of the relative clause in Korean whereas the semantic mismatch in Japanese (Yoshida, 2006) and the contextual cue in Chinese (Hsu, 2007) made a structural prediction possible. Instead, the combination of the semantic Match and the Genitive marker accelerated the processing of the upcoming relative clause in Korean. The predictive effect was not clearly observed at the expected locus of the effects in the L2 parser. In addition, there was a frequency effect at the classifier itself, which was amplified by the L2 parser. Based on the findings, this dissertation supports the claim that the parser is universally incremental and predictive, but it further argues that the degree of the predictability and the types of information used for the prediction vary depending on the language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/availability-semantic-syntactic-information-their/docview/1282652033/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zhezha-Thaumanavar, Mikela",2012,"Social networks, L2 pragmatics, and Spanish <i>hasta</i> as an aspectual marker with and without negation: Student understandings, judgments, and uses","This dissertation investigates how social networks influence understandings, judgments, and uses of L2 pragmatics. The pragmatic target is the particle hasta ‘until’ as it is used orally and in writing to mark inception with and without negation in Spanish. This study examines how L2 students of Spanish understand, judge, and use hasta when they are members of social networks in university Spanish classes based on (a) pedagogy practice, (b) class level, and (c) mode of expression, and when, outside of university Spanish classes, they are integrated into social networks that involve exposure to different dialectal varieties of Spanish. Data were collected from 72 students of Spanish. Statistical analysis revealed that (a) students’ attitudes towards L2 pragmatics are influenced by the linguistic norms propagated by their L2 instructors; (b) correlations are not always positive between class level and understandings, judgments, and uses of L2 pragmatics; (c) mode of expression affects only oral production of L2 pragmatics; and (d) outside the classroom, membership in social networks that expose individuals to particular Spanish dialects affects L2 pragmatics in speech and writing in opposite ways. This study contributes to (1) Spanish pragmatics, by showing that (a) pragmatic change can be built on semantic and syntactic interaction, (b) NPI formation in Spanish can be affected by the scope of negation, and (c) aspectual markers in Spanish can derive from contextually-influenced verbal situations and may be dialect-specific; (2) Spanish sociolinguistics, by demonstrating that (a) there is value in using network analysis to study language variation and change in Spanish, (b) approaching Spanish L2 classrooms as social networks is worthwhile, and (c) social network analysis may provide a viable alternative or complement to SLA approaches in the study of L2 pragmatics in Spanish; and (3) Spanish L2 pedagogy, by highlighting (a) the didactic importance of influencing student ideologies toward L2 pragmatics, (b) that students might benefit from being introduced to L2 pragmatics at the beginning stages of their Spanish language study, and (c) the need for teachers of L2 Spanish to revise currently held expectations for appropriate student understandings, judgments, and uses of L2 pragmatic forms.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/social-networks-l2-pragmatics-spanish-i-hasta-as/docview/1284158673/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Choi, Yujeong",2012,Repair negotiation by English L2 learners,"It is widely accepted that L2 learners often face communication problems due to lack of competency in the target language and familiarity with its culture of origin. One way to resolve miscommunication problems is to seek clarification of the utterance; this process is called repair negotiation (Nakahama et al. 2001). Repair negotiation has been studied as a subset of Long's (1996) Interaction Hypothesis in second language acquisition (SLA). Existing research has solely focused on repair negotiation which is initiated by the native speaker or teacher rather than the L2 learner, thus resulting in other-initiated repair (OIR). However, it has also been found that a L2 learner can recognize mistakes while monitoring self utterance and initiate repair or self correction of the utterance, resulting in self-initiated repair (SIR). Unfortunately, little attention has been given to repair negotiation initiated by the L2 learner and to what degree SIR facilitates L2 language development; even less attention has been given to overarching or combining two types of repair negotiation as well as measuring to what extent different types of repair negotiation between NNS-NNS lead to improving development of the second language. Three research questions were proposed for this dissertation research: (1) How do different types of tasks relate to the use of NNS's repair organization? (2) Does repair negotiation between L2 learners lead to development of linguistic targets? (3) Does type of task affect development of morpho-syntactic features? In order to answer these questions, two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1 in response to the first research question, twenty two high beginning to low advance learners of English participated in this study. The participants with the same proficiency levels were paired. The participants completed several tasks, including one-way information gap task, jigsaw task, and decision-making task. The results show that the production of SIR was elicited most frequently in the decision-making task whereas the production of OIR was elicited most frequently in the one-way information gap task. After the treatment, a diagnostic test was given to the subjects of Experiment 1 in order to determine the appropriate level of participants for Experiment 2. The results of the diagnostic test show that the subjects from levels 3 and 4 were the most appropriate. Based on the results of Experiment 1, two types of tasks (one-way information gap task vs. the decision-making task) and the intermediate level of participants were chosen to address the second and third research questions. In response to the second and third research questions, Experiment 2 was conducted with intermediate L2 English learners (n=36) using a pretest-post test-delayed post test design. The linguistic targets chosen for were past tense and relative clause (subject, object, and oblique relative clause) in the morpho-syntactic area. The results of this research suggest that past tense is learned more effectively than relative clause; repair negotiation between L2 learners is particularly beneficial in recognizing past tense morpheme, leading to the learning of morphology of past tense. Additionally, types of task differently influenced the learning of the two linguistic targets; one-way information gap task was more effective for learners in the short term than was the decision-making task. This study gives support for the interaction hypothesis to repair negotiation between learners along with task-based instructions in the classroom.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/repair-negotiation-english-l2-learners/docview/1315231127/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kennedy, Kristen M.",2012,What we don't learn in the classroom: The acquisition of sociolinguistic competence during study abroad,"This study examines the acquisition of target-like patterns of variation by 22 American learners of French during study abroad (SA) in France and correlates such acquisition with the creation of dense, multiplex, exchange-based social networks (Milroy 1980) with native speakers (NSs) during the SA period. In this longitudinal study, naturalistic speech data recorded via sociolinguistic interviews (Labov 1966) provide empirical evidence for the incipient acquisition of three phonological variables showing stylistic variation in NS speech: 1) the elision of clitic nucleic vowels; 2) the elision of /l/ in 3 rd person subject pronouns, and; 3) the reduction of word-final obstruent-liquid consonant clusters. Speech data are compared and correlated, using a mixed-effects model (Rbrul, Johnson 2009), with the results of a social network strength scale (SNSS, Milroy 1980:139) designed by the researcher for the SA learning context. Data for this study include over 5,500 tokens of clitic nucleic vowels, 1,500 tokens of /l/ in 3rd person subject pronouns, and 1200 tokens of word-final consonant clusters. Results demonstrate that phonological variation patterns are acquired in a predictable order based on token type and collocation, that social networks with NSs are statistically significant predictors of phonological variation patterns for two of the three variables, and that social factors, such as previous (short-term) contact with French or coursework in French are not statistically significant predictors of phonological variation patterns among L2 French learners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/what-we-dont-learn-classroom-acquisition/docview/1319302067/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Li, Ming-Ching",2012,The acquisition of tense and agreement by early child second language learners,"This longitudinal study examines the acquisition of tense and agreement morphology by child L2 learners in an early stage of language acquisition. The objectives of this study are twofold. The first is to observe the development of verb inflections and syntactic competence over time from an early stage by Chinese child L2 learners of English. The second is to determine the similarities and differences in the acquisition of verb inflections by comparing child L2 learners of this study with child L1 and adult L2 learners from the literature in this field. Participants included six Chinese-L1 English-L2 children between the ages of 7 and 9, with a length of residence in the United States between four and six months. Data were collected regularly over a period of seven months. Tasks include a conversation with the investigator on general topics, and an elicitation task via picture description. Speech production samples were audio-recorded and later transcribed to analyze the use of verb inflections: the third-person singular – s , regular past form –ed, copula be, and auxiliary be, and the use of related syntactic properties: the use of overt subjects, and the case of subject pronouns. Based on previous research, the study adopts the Separation Hypothesis, claiming that abstract properties can be present in the syntactic representation in the absence of overt morphology, and the acquisition of syntax triggers the acquisition of morphology. Results demonstrated the early acquisition of syntactic properties, the use of overt subjects and the nominative case for the subject pronouns, while conversely, verb inflections were largely omitted. This suggests that the functional category [Infl] is already in place in the L2 initial state and that syntax acts as a trigger for the acquisition of overt morphology. The Separation Hypothesis is consequently supported.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-tense-agreement-early-child-second/docview/1447010457/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"van Compernolle, Remi A.",2012,Developing sociopragmatic capacity in a second language through concept-based instruction,"This thesis reports on a study that sought to support intermediate-level US university learners of French (N = 8) in developing advanced second language (L2) sociopragmatic capacity through concept-based instruction. Although a number of studies have explored the teaching of pragmatics, such research typically focuses on speech act realizations in relation to social conventions of appropriateness. Sociopragmatic information, if provided to learners, is limited to such factors as the formality of context and the relative age and/or status of one’s interlocutor. In the present study, an alternative approach—concept-based instruction—is proposed in order to focus on the underlying sociopragmatic meanings instantiated by linguistic resources. Concept-based instruction derives from Vygotsky’s claim that the goal of formal education should be to lead students to internalize scientific concepts in order to promote abstract thinking, and then to link scientific knowledge to practical activity. Drawing on the work initiated by Galperin and Davydov, and extended to the L2 field by Negueruela and others, the study focused on promoting the internalization of sociopragmatic concepts (e.g., indexicality, social distance, power hierarchies) that were linked to specific communicative practices (e.g., second-person address forms). Through the analysis of verbalization tasks, appropriateness judgment questionnaires, and spoken strategic interaction scenarios, the study documents (1) the development of concept-based sociopragmatic knowledge; (2) the development of spoken performance abilities; and (3) the relationship between sociopragmatic knowledge and performance abilities. The results show gains in sociopragmatic knowledge and spoken performance abilities. It is also argued that the learners’ sociopragmatic knowledge provided a systematic orienting basis for choosing the pragmatic forms that fit their communicative needs. In addition, the analysis highlights the role of cooperative interaction between a tutor and the learners in mediating concept development and gains in control in spoken performance.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/developing-sociopragmatic-capacity-second/docview/1618227618/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Biesinger, Geoffrey Scott",2012,Linguistics Improvements and Correlates in a Japanese Study Abroad Program,"Study abroad (SA) is typically thought to provide an excellent opportunity for second language acquisition, particularly through exposure to and application of the target language within the target culture. However, actual language gains vary greatly among SA participants and some may gain very little (Freed, 1995a). The purpose of the current study is to determine some specific linguistic gains made by 28 second language learners of Japanese studying for two semesters in Japan, and to determine possible correlates with these gains. Specifically, it addresses whether or not these SA students improve their grammatical proficiency, lexical proficiency, narrative ability, fluency, and pragmatics proficiency. It then explores how language learning aptitude, personality, language use, social networking, and initial ability correlate with those gains. To measure these gains and their correlates it uses the following instruments: the Elicited Imitation task, a picture story, the Pragmatics Self-Assessment, the Non-Word Repetition test, the NEO-Five Factor Inventory, the Language Contact Profile, and the Study Abroad Social Interaction Questionnaire. The results indicated that these SA students improved significantly in at least on measure of grammatical proficiency, lexical proficiency, narrative ability, fluency, and pragmatics proficiency. Initial ability and language use proved to correlate best with each area of linguistic gain; however, the other correlates were also related in certain areas. SA students should prepare to use their language and participate in social networks to best improve their linguistic abilities.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/linguistics-improvements-correlates-japanese/docview/2549327339/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kivik, Piibi-Kai",2012,Conversation-for-learning in Estonian coffee-hour: An interactional linguistics perspective,"The dissertation applies methods of interactional linguistics to study conversation-for-learning as an institutional speech event comprising the frames of language pedagogy and mundane conversation. Audio-recorded multi-party interactions of 26 sessions (23 h) of weekly Estonian coffee-hour at a North American university were analyzed. The participants were foreign language students and their native-speaker instructor (the author), community learners and other native speakers. Close analysis focused on sequences displaying intersections of frames where participant roles (e.g., expert vs. novice) are dynamically shifted. These sequences fall under the notion of repair, where participants address trouble (1) in talk by others (other-correction, other-initiation of repair, candidate understandings); (2) in own talk, in cooperation with the interlocutor (word searches, 3rd position repairs). The results show that both first and second language speakers initiated frame changes and chose to align or disalign with their interlocutors' frame orientations. Frame changes were systematically motivated by interpersonal or institutional needs (e.g., switch to pedagogy to close a delicate topic). Specific linguistic practices were identified, which enable participants to attend to more than one frame simultaneously, such as the conflation of other-initiation and other-repair in linguistic corrections with try-marked prosody, a word search routine to initiate topics and take turns, repair of morphology in collaborative story-telling, “doing morphology” by marking suffixes prosodically. The practices demonstrate interactional uses of target (and learner-) language structures and make visible locally relevant teaching and learning goals.

Forty-one ELL students in three parallel intact classes were chosen to participate in the study. A two-way repeated measures Analysis of Variance was conducted to examine the effects of the treatment (two ways of corrective feedback, i.e., recasts and metalinguistic feedback) and time (pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest). The results demonstrated there were no significant differences between the two experimental groups and the control group. A closer examination of the effect size from the pretest to the immediate posttest revealed that the metalinguistic group yielded the largest effect size, followed by the recasts group. When the items containing only biclausal requests (high-level politeness requests) were examined separately, it was found that the metalinguistic group significantly outperformed the recasts group and the control group at the time of the immediate posttest. However, the improvement was not maintained in the delayed posttest.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-recasts-metalinguistic-feedback-on/docview/1314417772/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Polizzi, Marie-Christine",2013,The development of Spanish aspect in the second language classroom: Concept-based pedagogy and dynamic assessment,"The main objective of this case-study research is to document the learning and potential development of Spanish aspect by a female multilingual learner of Spanish, Judith, during her second year of study in an SLA classroom context at a university in Northeastern United States over a two semester (one year) period. This research also examines the specific classroom context in which this learner's development was documented. The second objective is therefore to document the extent to which this approach mediated potential grammatical development in Judith, particularly in her conceptual understandings of Spanish aspect. A Vygotskyan-inspired concept-based pedagogy (CBP) (Gal'Perin, 1989, 1992; Negueruela, 2003; Negueruela and Lantolf, 2006; Negueruela, 2008) and dynamic assessment (DA) procedures (Poehner and Lantolf, 2005;, Lantolf &amp; Thorne, 2006; Poehner, 2008), both based on Sociocultural Theory (Vygotsky 1978, 1986) were implemented to teach Spanish to learners. The quality of the new meanings being developed by Judith was documented over time under this particular concept-based teaching context. Data was collected in order to capture the personal histories and orientations to different contexts and activities for this research participant. A combination of insights from Spradley (1980) and Emerson (1995) on ethnographic records was used in order to document the social learning situation taking place in the classroom. It included a combination of artifacts such as field notes, teaching artifacts, tape-recorded interviews, and oral and written discourse from Judith. To analyze how the research participant developed the concept of Spanish aspect (preterit versus imperfect), I used the SCOBA (Schema for Complete Orienting Basis of Action) that was developed by Negueruela (2003) for L2 learning of Spanish. I also used Poehner (2008) and Bloome et al. (2008)'s perspective on data analysis to examine the meaning-making of the L2 learner participant in interaction while she was using the artifacts and interacting with her peers and me, the instructor and investigator. This combination of ethnographic and CBI tools aims at providing a richer picture of this multilingual learner's development over time that would reflect the complexity and dynamic nature of language learning and development (as suggested by Van Lier, 2004).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-spanish-aspect-second-language/docview/1323303968/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lovitt, Ashli",2013,The Linguistic Gains and Acculturation of American High School Students on Exchange Programs in Germany,"There has been a sharp rise in study abroad participation over the last few decades (Institute for International Education, 2011), which can largely be explained by the rise of short-term study abroad programs. While there is much to be gained from participation in such programs, mid-length and year programs may offer the greatest benefits for linguistic gain (e.g. Brecht, Davidson &amp; Ginsberg, 1996; Freed, 1995; Lafford, 2004; Vande Berg, 2003). Despite the advantages of longer stays, the percentage of students studying abroad for an entire year ""has remained steady for over a decade"" (Institute for International Education, 2011). Roughly four-percent of all students who study abroad choose to do so for an academic or calendar year. This statistic points to a problem with attracting students to pursue longer stays abroad. The Open Doors Report , prepared by the Institute for International Education, assumes a narrow view of study abroad by excluding data on American high school students. The present study attempts to fill a gap in the research by examining the overseas experiences of 14 American high school and gap year students who studied abroad in Germany during the academic year of 2011-2012. Data for this study was collected in the form of questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, the WebCAPE German placement test developed at Brigham Young University, and unofficial Oral Proficiency Interviews. The findings of the current study may help inform those involved in study abroad at both the high school and university levels. The purposes of this mixed-methods research, which is organized into three articles, are the following: 1) to investigate students' use of technology in a study abroad context, and examine how online communication might be indicative of participation in multiple Activity Systems (e.g. Engeström, 2011; Lantolf &amp; Thorne, 2006; Leontiev, 2006), 2) to describe students' degree of participation in new Communities of Practice at German schools (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998; 2000) and, 3) to investigate students' (re)construction of national and regional identities. The role that language proficiency and prior instruction in the target language might play in the study abroad context is explored across all three topics.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/linguistic-gains-acculturation-american-high/docview/1364612101/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Bishop, Jason Brandon",2013,"Prenuclear Accentuation in English: Phonetics, Phonology, Information Structure","A primary function of prosody in many languages is to convey information structure—the ""packaging"" of a sentence's content into categories such as ""focus"", ""given"" and ""topic"". In English and other West Germanic languages it is widely assumed that focus is signaled prosodically by the location of a nuclear pitch accent. As a result, prenuclear, or ""secondary"" accents are standardly regarded as optional, phonological objects that are unrelated to the information structural representation. This dissertation investigates, from the perspective of the listener, how valid this claim about prenuclear accents is. As a case study, I consider a putative prosodic ambiguity: the size of the focus constituent in English SVO constructions (i.e., ""broad focus"" on a VP versus ""narrow focus"" on an object). My approach to this issue is essentially a three-pronged one, considering the production, perception and processing of prenuclear accents in relation to this contrast. Recent phonetic evidence from production studies is the starting point for a set of perception experiments (Chapter 2) and a pair of cross-modal priming experiments (Chapter 3). Both sets of experiments provide evidence that listeners have expectations about focus-prenuclear accent correspondences that mirror patterns reported in speakers' productions, suggesting that the broad versus narrow focus contrast is not a genuine prosodic ambiguity. An additional matter that is investigated is the extent to which individual differences in ""cognitive processing styles"" (autistic traits and verbal working memory) contribute to variation among listeners. To account for the experimental findings, I argue that the prosodic realization of the size of the focus constituent in English SVOs represents conventionalized, phonological behavior. The variation, it is shown, can be captured by an Autosegmental Metrical model of prosodic structure that includes syntagmatic relations of tonal prominence along the lines proposed by Ladd (1990). This level of ""tonal metrical structure"" represents linguistically-specified pitch range, and it is demonstrated that such structure is independently needed to account for the prosodic realization of several other information structural contrasts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/prenuclear-accentuation-english-phonetics/docview/1400821076/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Brandl, Anel",2013,Processing strategies by beginning L2 learners of English and Spanish: A crosslinguistic study,"A central issue in second language acquisition (SLA) research is the relationship between morphosyntactic and lexical-semantic knowledge among L2 learners. It has been proposed that, L2 language acquisition starts with transfer of L1 semantic and morphosyntactic processing strategies; however, it has been observed that, at lower proficiency levels, the language processor may not have sufficient resources to transfer and use L1 morphosyntactic cues such as agreement morphology, case markers, etc. to process the L2. Therefore, this dissertation investigates whether L2 learners default to more local and lexical-semantic parsing (i.e. universal parsing) at the beginning stages of second language acquisition. This dissertation examines the processing strategies of two groups of L2 learners (L1 English – L2 Spanish and L1 Spanish – L2 English) on two experimental tasks: a self-paced listening task and a sentence interpretation task. The results suggest that L1 transfer does not occur at the beginning stages of acquisition; that is, the beginning L2 learners in this study were not able to process agreement cues; thus, they did not demonstrated the ability to integrate grammatical information encoded in verbal morphology in real time processing. Instead, the results indicated that L2 learners, regardless of L1, defaulted to local and lexical-semantic strategies (e.g., first-noun strategy) to process the L2 at the beginning stages of acquisition. These results lend support to the First Noun Principle (VanPatten 2007) and are discussed in term of the representational and processing problem of L2 acquisition. Implications for models of L2 sentence processing (Input Processing and the Competition Model) are also presented in this dissertation.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-strategies-beginning-l2-learners/docview/1410774205/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Yang, Li",2013,A web-based approach to learning expressions of gratitude in Chinese as a foreign language,"This study investigates the effects of instruction delivered via a learner-centered, self-access website on the learning of expressions of gratitude by L2 Chinese learners across proficiency levels. Three research questions are addressed: (1) whether the web-based instruction facilitates students' learning of Chinese expressions of gratitude, (2) whether the effects of instruction vary across proficiency levels, and (3) how L2 learners regard the use of the website as a learning tool. Based on the noticing hypothesis and the pragmatic consciousness-raising approach, a pragmatics website was developed that provided explicit instruction on how to appropriately express gratitude in Chinese and offered awareness-raising exercises and activities for practice. It was structured in eight instructional units and two review sessions. To address the three research questions, this study adopted a pretest-posttest design to include two groups of learners who differed in their proficiency in the Chinese language. The two groups of learners received pragmatics instruction delivered via the self-access website over five weeks. Two weeks prior to the instruction, all learners were asked to complete (1) the language contact profile (LCP) for eliciting their demographic information and their contact with Chinese outside the classroom, (2) a local standardized Chinese proficiency test (CPT) for assessing their proficiency in Chinese, (3) discourse completion tasks/tests (DCT) for soliciting their production of Chinese expressions of gratitude, (4) metapragmatic assessment tasks (MAT) for eliciting their metapragmatic assessment of thanking responses provided, and (5) retrospective interviews for soliciting learners' explanations of their assessments in the MAT. On a weekly basis during the treatment period, learners wrote reflective e-journals in response to prompt questions provided by the researcher, which helped track learners' self-access study progress and their on-going perceptions of the website. One week after the online instruction, all learners were also asked to complete the same types of questionnaires (i.e., the DCT and the MAT) and retrospective interviews for assessing their pragmatic development. Results showed that after receiving the web-based instruction, all learners produced more appropriate expressions of gratitude and used more varied thanking strategies in their responses, regardless of their proficiency. Learners' assessments of Chinese expressions of gratitude became more target-like and their metapragmatic awareness was also promoted. However, higher-level learners seemed to have benefited more from the instruction in their production of Chinese expressions of gratitude than lower-level participants, and the higher-level group demonstrated an overall higher level of pragmatic awareness than the lower-level group after the online instruction. But no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of learners' metapragmatic assessments. In addition, participants responded positively to the website and put forward constructive suggestions to improve it. Finally, this study interpreted the findings based on cognitive processing theories, proposed both theoretical and pedagogical implications, and discussed the limitations of this study and directions for future research.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/web-based-approach-learning-expressions-gratitude/docview/1417062031/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Canner, Marc T.",2013,Working Memory-Learning Condition Interactions Proficiency in L2 Russian under Naturalistic and Formal Learning Conditions,"The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the relationships between working memory (WM) and three commonly used learning strategies or conditions in the nature of proficiency among adult L2 Russian learners. Based on the aptitude-learning condition interaction framework articulated by Robinson (2002b), the study identifies two types of relationships between the fixed variables of working memory and learning condition, and four variables related to second language proficiency (SLP) in Russian: accuracy, fluency, overall general proficiency or `native-likeness', and the occurrence of potentially fossilized forms in speech. Three main learning contexts were identified, including strictly naturalistic conditions resulting from immersion in-country (NC), naturalistic learning followed by formal learning experiences (NF), and formal training followed by naturalistic learning through immersion (FN). 37 participants were recruited, including naturalistic learners (n = 12), naturalistic/formal (n = 12), and formal/naturalistic participants (n=13). A proficiency interview was used to test learners for their L2 Russian proficiency, including measures for fluency, overall proficiency or native-likeness, accuracy via the elicitation of three prevalent structures in native speech, and the presence of potentially fossilized inter language (IL) forms. Based on proficiency scores and answers provided on an experience-related questionnaire, three experiments were conducted. The first experiment tests for predictive relationships between WM and the four aspects of proficiency for each learning condition. The second experiment investigates potential interactions between WM and the three learning conditions in relation to the main aspects of proficiency. A third experiment tests for correlations between the amount of formal training and accuracy-related measures for the two combined (NF and FN) learning contexts. The results of a logistic regression indicate significant predictive correlations between working memory and accuracy, and a negative correlation with the rate of potential fossilization for the naturalistic condition. No predictive significance for WM alone and aspects of proficiency was found in either NF or FN conditions. The second experiment yielded results indicating a significant interaction between WM and naturalistic conditions for fluency, and significance for interactions between WM and the amount of formal training for both accuracy and general proficiency for the formal/naturalistic (FN) context. The third experiment found predictive correlations between the amount of formal training and fossilization for the FN condition. The study found no significant correlations for the NF context. Results are interpreted to signify differential effects in relationships between WM and the major aspects of proficiency among different conditions, with an evident impact of the order or sequence of naturalistic and formal experience for the combined contexts. It appears that working memory does not act alone, but interacts with the nature of learning conditions to affect proficiency. Significant correlations between the amount of formal instruction and accuracy-related measures including fossilization are indicated.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/working-memory-learning-condition-interactions/docview/1431980786/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tecedor Cabrero, Marta",2013,Developing interactional competence through video-based computer-mediated conversations: Beginning learners of Spanish,"This dissertation examines the discourse produced by beginning learners of Spanish using social media. Specifically, it looks at the use and development of interactional resources during two video-mediated conversations. Through a combination of Conversation Analysis tools and quantitative data analysis, the use of turn-taking strategies, repair trajectories, and alignment moves was examined to discover how beginning language learners manage videoconferencing exchanges and develop their interactional capabilities in this new interactional setting. The goal of this investigation was twofold: 1) to describe and explain how students construct, manage and maintain conversations via videoconferencing, and 2) to gain a better understanding of the links between technology-based social media and language learning. The results of this study indicate that instructional videoconferencing conversations display their own clearly delimited and idiosyncratic organization of interactional features. In terms of turn-taking, the results of the analyses demonstrate that beginning learners are fully capable of participating competently in speaker selection to manage a conversation with a peer of similar proficiency level. In the area of repair, the analyses show that, during instructional videoconferencing exchanges, beginning learners orient to both the communication of personal meaning and the accuracy of their discourse. They enact this orientation through the use of self-initiated self-repair. Finally, with regard to the use of alignment moves, the analyses reveal that, in tune with their nascent linguistic and interactional abilities, beginning learners use primarily acknowledgement moves.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/developing-interactional-competence-through-video/docview/1443852260/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Muramatsu, Chie",2013,"Portraits of second language learners: Agency, identities, and second language learning","This study is a qualitative examination of second language (L2) learning processes by four advanced learners of Japanese in the community of a summer intensive full-immersion program in the United States. Using L2 socialization theory as a theoretical framework, this study conceives of L2 learning as a process of social participation in a community of practice and examines L2 learning processes by four learners, focusing on the dynamic interplay between the affordances of the social community and the agency of the individual learners. The purpose of this study is twofold: (a) It investigates the ways in which the four learners exercise their agency to pursue their goals of learning Japanese and (b) it documents how the different ways in which the four learners exercise agency form different trajectories of learning and create different experiences of L2 socialization. This study has adopted an ethnographic case study approach to the investigation of research inquiries. Through the analyses of data obtained from multiple sources, including interviews with the four learners, observations of their engagement in the community of practice of the summer intensive full-immersion program, their audio-recorded conversations with other members of the community, and various artifacts, this study explores the role of L2 learner agency in the process of L2 socialization and describes in depth their experiences of learning Japanese from their emic perspectives. The case studies of the four learners have highlighted the different ways in which they engaged in the community of practice, understood their tasks of learning Japanese, interpreted the affordances of the social community, negotiated the meaning of their participations, defined and redefined their sense of self, and eventually achieved their L2 learning goals. The findings suggest that the richness and effectiveness of a social environment are not characterized by the physical and academic affordances of a social community alone; rather they are constructed in a dynamic relation between the affordance structure of a social community and the L2 learners' agency in the pursuit of the joint enterprise of making L2 learning happen. With regard to the role of L2 learner agency, the study has foregrounded the important role of the aspirations of the four L2 learners for personal transformation and negotiation of the meaning of self of the past, the present, and the future. The findings suggest that L2 learners' diverse and complex social and personal desires for learning an L2 may not be able to be explained using the notion of investment (Norton, 1995, 2000) alone. Since the SLA debate initiated by Firth and Wagner (1997, 2007), SLA research has begun to reconceptualize L2 learners as socially situated beings with diverse needs, wants, and identities. This study presents four portraits of L2 learners who engaged in the enterprise of learning Japanese, as a means of contributing to this reconceptualization, and explores for these four learners what it meant to learn Japanese in the summer of 2010.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/portraits-second-language-learners-agency/docview/1443853129/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tai, Shu-Ju",2013,From TPACK-in-Action workshops to English classrooms: CALL competencies developed and adopted into classroom teaching,"As researchers in the CALL teacher education field noted, teachers play the pivotal role in the language learning classrooms because they are the gate keepers who decide whether technology or CALL has a place in their teaching, and they select technology to support their teaching, which determines what CALL activities language learners are exposed to and how learners use them (Hubbard 2008). While a considerable amount of research related to CALL teacher education has focused on teachers' attitudes, beliefs, and confidence regarding CALL (e.g., Kamhi-Stein, 2000; Kassen &amp; Higgins, 1997; Lam, 2000; Peters, 2006; van Olphen, 2007), there are very few studies that have investigated the impact of CALL teacher education programs (Desjardins &amp; Peters, 2007; Hegelheimer, 2006; Kessler, 2007; Kilickaya, 2009). These studies reported that teachers confirmed their learning and adoption of CALL into their classroom teaching; however, the findings are based on self-report data, which are insufficient for capturing actual classrooms CALL integration. Moreover, the Call for Papers in the January 2013 issue of the Language Learning and Technology Journal calls for research in CALL teacher education to ""address another crucial factor affecting the degree and quality of implementation: teachers' CALL competencies and knowledge base"" (p. 145). In view of the need to bridge the gap and to develop a fuller picture of how teachers integrate CALL in the classrooms, the present study used an observation instrument based on the TPACK framework (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) to investigate the impact of TPACK-in-Action workshops had on English teachers in Taiwan from four different perspectives: whether the CALL workshops (1) met participants' expectations in helping them integrate CALL; (2) contributed to participants' perception change toward CALL and CALL integration; (3) helped participants develop their TPACK competencies; and (4) helped participants adopt the learned CALL competencies into their classrooms. The 15-hour TPACK-in-Action CALL workshops were conducted as part of the teacher professional development for 24 elementary English Teachers in Taiwan. The TPACK-in-Action model (Tai &amp; Chuang, 2012), developed specifically to help English teachers integrate CALL, was employed to guide the design of the workshops. Situated in the mixed methods research design with the guidance of the TPACK framework, qualitative data through reflections, interviews, and observations, and quantitative data through surveys and reflections, were collected before, during, and after the CALL workshops to help identify the impact of the TPACK-in-Action workshops. Findings of the present study showed that the TPACK-in-Action CALL workshops had a strong and positive impact on elementary English teachers in Taiwan. In addition to helping them showing positive perception changes toward CALL integration, it was observed that the workshops helped participants develop CALL competencies, such as integrating online materials, using cloud computing for student interaction, selecting appropriate technology for content teaching, and matching the affordance of technology to their instructional goals and pedagogy as well as adopt the learned competencies into classroom teaching. Findings indicated that observations were found to be effective in investigating the impact of the TPACK-in-Action CALL workshops. Not only were observation data triangulated with self-report data to prevent potential discrepancies from happening, they helped identify teachers' CALL competencies and visualize their CALL integration. In sum, this dissertation contributed to providing empirical evidence on the effect of using observation as a measure to understand how teachers integrate CALL in their classrooms and adding a new perspective while investigating CALL teacher education. It also has theoretical implication for CALL teacher education research and pedagogical implications for CALL teacher education practice", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/tpack-action-workshops-english-classrooms-call/docview/1450065611/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kim, Eun Ho",2013,Development of interactional competence in L2 Korean: The use of Korean interpersonal modal endings -<i>canh</i>- and -<i>ketun</i>,"This study investigates the ways in which Korean interpersonal modal endings – canh - and – ketun are used and developed as interactional resources by L2 speakers. Using the methodology of conversation analysis, this study not only examines how speakers employ – canh - and – ketun in the formation of an action, but also compares the (non) use of these endings by L2 speakers at different proficiency levels. By taking this combined approach to the use and the development of grammatical resources by L2 speakers, this dissertation aims to (1) investigate the ways in which L2 speakers use – canh - and – ketun to accomplish certain social actions, such as giving accounts or disagreeing, by displaying relevant knowledge states and (2) illustrate the stages of L2 speakers’ development that correlate to interactional competence in the use of these linguistic resources. The data of the current study comes from approximately 240 hours of video-recorded classroom interactions in a Korean as a second language context. Focusing on three different sequential environments recurrently associated with opportunities to use – canh - and – ketun to accomplish particular actions, this study presents detailed descriptions of how participants’ use and nonuse of these forms work as resources for dealing with varied epistemic access to proposed information in talk-in-interaction. By adopting a cross-sectional design for comparison, this study also shows developmental patterns in the use of – canh - and – ketun by L2 speakers of Korean. Close scrutiny of the use and nonuse of these resources reveals whether and to what extent their interactional use by L2 speakers of different proficiency levels approaches that of L1 speakers. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of Korean interpersonal modal endings in terms of the management and distribution of information as expressed through speakers’ actions. This study also contributes to the growing body of research that takes a CA approach to the development of interactional competence by L2 speakers. It is hoped that this study both yields insights into how language use can be fully understood by adding the factors of management of information, and promotes CA approach to research on Korean L2 interaction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-interactional-competence-l2-korean/docview/1468460374/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Sondermann, Kerstin",2013,"Bilingual gestures: The ""manual"" way of informing the notion of 'balanced bilinguals'","Defining what makes a person bilingual is notoriously difficult and dependent on various factors like fluency, age of acquisition, and situational context, among others. The notion of a `balanced bilingual' is even more elusive and fraught with limitations regarding the proper assessment and linguistic profiling of bilinguals, leading to different categorizations of what constitutes a `balanced bilingual' among researchers. The present study attempted to address this issue by drawing on other, non-verbal clues provided by bilingual speakers: their gestures. Studies have shown that speakers of languages that are typologically different (see Talmy, 1985) tend to gesture in distinct patterns when describing motion events (see, e.g., Kellerman &amp; VanHoof, 2003; Kita &amp; Özyürek, 2003; McNeill &amp; Duncan, 2000). These patterns have been found to be highly resistant to change when acquiring a typologically distinct language (see Gullberg, de Bot, &amp; Volterra, 2008). This study took a qualitative look at the gestures produced by nine bilingual speakers of English and Spanish when narrating motion events in both languages. The goal of this research was to examine the gestural behavior of balanced bilinguals, to determine to what extent — if any — their gesture patterns can be compared to those that have been suggested for monolinguals as well as L2 learners based on the available literature, and to see what these patterns can reveal about the cognitive processes underlying the speech and gesture production of these bilinguals. A detailed analysis of the speech and gesture patterns of all participants revealed several trends that - despite considerable individual variation — set the group of balanced bilinguals apart from what we currently know about English and Spanish monolinguals, as well as L2 learners. Gesture patterns were predominantly in sync with the typological patterns used in speech, yet there was also evidence of a blended ""hybrid"" system, which — often by means of subtle differences in the timing and alignment of gestures — allowed speakers access to a wider variety of gesture patterns than would otherwise be the case. In many instances, gestures provided valuable insights into how motion events were conceptualized, which speech alone would have been unable to convey.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/bilingual-gestures-manual-way-informing-notion/docview/1491390140/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Smith, Jenna Lynn",2013,Style shifting in Japanese native/non-native conversation: an in depth analysis of short/long form usage,"There are two distinct styles of predicates in Japanese: the long form and the short form. The former is associated with politeness/formality, while the latter is reserved for more intimate social settings. It is expected that when the relationship of the speakers and the setting remains the same, speakers will use one form. However, studies on native speakers show mixing of the two forms, known as style shifting, occurs even when the factors mentioned earlier remain constant. This study examines short and long form usage and style shifting in conversations between native and non-native speakers. Similar to native speakers, the majority of native/non-native dyads shared a dominant speech style, and all speakers (including the non-native speakers) engaged in style shifting. A closer look at individual conversations showed the non-native speakers' awareness of what forms they were using, and evidence of style shifting serving specific discourse functions.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/style-shifting-japanese-native-non-conversation/docview/1501439126/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Youn, Soo Jung",2013,Validating task-based assessment of L2 pragmatics in interaction using mixed methods,"This study investigates the validity for task-based assessment of L2 pragmatics in interaction in an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) setting for classroom assessment and meaningful score interpretations for stakeholders. As a validity framework, Kane’s (2006) argument-based approach to validity was employed. In view of the complexity of assessing L2 pragmatics in interaction and score interpretations from observed L2 pragmatic performances, score interpretations were built upon interpretive arguments comprising of four inferences, which guided the types of data analyzed and research steps taken in this study. Using the sequential mixed methods approach (Green, 2007; Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2003), qualitative and quantitative evidence was collected to provide valid support for the inferences and to strengthen the validity argument. Based on a large-scale needs analysis on EAP L2 pragmatic learning needs, two open role-play tasks that are meaningful and relevant to stakeholders in an EAP context were developed. Unlike the closed role-play task format, examinees were allowed to negotiate and naturally interact with interlocutors. In order to provide meaningful score interpretations to the stakeholders and to assist raters in making accurate evaluations of examinees’ interaction-involved L2 pragmatic performance, conversation analysis (CA)- informed analytical rating criteria with detailed descriptions were developed based on the detailed analyses of examinees’ L2 pragmatic performances in the role-play tasks. One hundred two adult ESL examinees completed the role-play tasks and monologic tasks. Four rater groups, consisting of 12 raters in total, scored each examinee’s pragmatic performance. A many-facet Rasch measurement using FACETS (Linacre, 2006) indicated that the role-play tasks displayed different levels of difficulty, which stably differentiated between the varying degrees of the 102 examinees’ pragmatic abilities. The raters showed internal consistency despite their different degrees of severity. Stable fit statistics and distinct difficulties were reported within each of the interaction-sensitive rating criteria, indicating that they contribute to measuring L2 pragmatic competence. In particular, the two rating categories for interactional competence were distinct in their difficulty levels, which supports the CA findings. Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses, all of the validity evidence was woven into the validity argument for task-based assessment of L2 pragmatics in interaction, focusing on the four types of inference, domain description, evaluation, generalization, and extrapolation. The current study exemplifies how the construct of L2 pragmatics in interaction can be operationalized based on the qualitative scrutiny of the target performance that is also supported by the quantitative findings, which contributes to the advancement of measuring L2 pragmatics. Lastly, this study provides additional grounds for the recent development of the validity argument approach in the field of language assessment at large.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/validating-task-based-assessment-l2-pragmatics/docview/1501476308/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Naito-Billen, Yuka",2012,Effects of Prosody while Disambiguating Ambiguous Japanese Sentences in the Brain of Native Speakers and Learners of Japanese: A Proposition for Pronunciation and Prosody Training,"Recently, the significant role that pronunciation and prosody plays in processing spoken language has been widely recognized and a variety of teaching methodologies of pronunciation/prosody has been implemented in teaching foreign languages. Thus, an analysis of how similarly or differently native and L2 learners of a language use pronunciation/prosodic cues needs to be further investigated, and the learnability of pronunciation/prosodic features should be explored. In this study, the role of prosody in Japanese sentence processing will be specifically explored among native speakers and L2 learners of Japanese whose native language is English. In Experiment 1 and 2, the effect of prosody during Japanese sentence processing was explored among native speakers using a psycholinguistic measurement. In Experiment 3, we compared L2 learners processing and judgment of Japanese sentences utilizing the brain-imaging technique Electroencephalography (EEG) together with a psycholinguistic measurement. In Experiment 1 and 2, native speakers of Japanese listened to globally ambiguous sentences that can be interpreted in two ways, and temporarily ambiguous sentences that have two different syntactic structures. They either rated how acceptable each sentence is or answered a comprehension question on each sentence. As for the globally ambiguous sentences, the results revealed that overall one type ('embedded-clause') of interpretation is preferred over the other type ('main-clause') of interpretation at the judgment given time pressure. Prosody guided their interpretations to a certain degree; however, it did not have a deterministic effect, especially for arriving at a 'main-clause' interpretation. As for the temporarily ambiguous sentences, significant effects of prosody in parsing temporarily ambiguous sentences were found, with the results suggesting that while parsing affects processing, its role is not deterministic. In Experiment 3, native speakers and intermediate- to advanced-level L2 learners of Japanese listened to two types of temporarily ambiguous sentences read with two types of prosody and rated how acceptable each sentence was. Simultaneously, their brain activity was continuously recorded using EEG. The results revealed important similarities and differences among the native speakers and L2 learners' processing of these sentences. Both groups yielded a brain response that indicates the detection of prosodic break, and prosody was utilized at least to some extent. However, the patterns were different among the two groups, and the precise nature of the effects for the learners suggests that they have difficulties with processing non-default-type of structure ('main-clause' structure), and the congruent prosody for that structure ('main-clause prosody'). These results indicate that L2 learners have access to prosodic cues in sentence comprehension. On the other hand, the measurements of processing presented here suggest that these learners are not yet utilizing prosody in a native-like way, suggesting the utility of creating new ways to introduce prosody and its relation with the structure and meaning of Japanese sentences. It is suggested that teaching how to use prosodic cues in comprehending complex sentences with various types of sentence structures may develop L2 learners' ability to develop their oral communication skills.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-prosody-while-disambiguating-ambiguous/docview/1038151329/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Botero, Christopher G.",2011,Factors Underlying the Improvement of L2 Phonological Production Using Technology outside the Classroom,"When learning a foreign language, it is generally noted that focus on pronunciation is overlooked as curricula are often based on the language’s morphosyntax (Elliot, 1995a; Lord, 2005). The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of using technology outside the classroom to improve abilities in the second-language learner's L2 phonological system. It is hypothesized that by completing speech perception exercises outside the classroom via the internet, and also by manipulating the variables of metalinguistic explanation and type of feedback, the second-language learner will improve his/her production of target L2 sounds without disruption to the course program. This dissertation is based on two studies carried out at Pennsylvania State University. Study 1 took place during Spring semester 2008. All participants were students of Spanish 110 (Intermediate Spanish Conversation). Participants (n=12) were randomly placed into one of three groups; the first group (Group A) received audible examples and metalinguistic explanation of the target sound (the nonvelarization of the Spanish segment [l] in the syllable final position). These examples were provided in tasks that the participants completed online, outside of class. The second group (Group B) received only metalinguistic explanation and the third group (Group C) served as the control. Study 2 consisted of 30 participants who were enrolled Spanish 110 the following semester. In a similar fashion to the first study, participants were divided into three groups. The first received explicit training, audible examples and metalinguistic explanation (A). The second received explicit training and metalinguistic explanation (B), and the third served as the control group (C). During the course of the semester participants in both studies completed weekly exercises in Spanish perception using ANGEL, the online course management system at Penn State. The groups in Study 2 received short (approximately ten minutes) periods of explicit instruction (one per week in class, for eight weeks). All ‘pre-treatments’ and ‘post-treatments’ were digitally recorded and phonetic analysis was done using Praat Software. Data from both studies show that the groups receiving both metalinguistic explanation and audible input on ANGEL not only improved the ability to discriminate between L1 and L2 sounds, they also improved production of L2 phones. Furthermore, it was noted that exposure to explicit feedback and metalinguistic explanation had substantial roles in improvement of Spanish L2 phonology. Most significantly, all groups improved their L2 phonological production when compared to the control groups, supporting the notion that phonology can be supplemented to lower levels of language learning without changes to the curriculum.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/factors-underlying-improvement-l2-phonological/docview/2448448092/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Schenker, Theresa",2012,The effects of a virtual exchange on language skills and intercultural competence,"This dissertation explores the effects of a cross-cultural, cross-lingual virtual exchange on students’ foreign language skills and intercultural competence. Specifically, the dissertation investigates the effects of students’ participation in a twelve-week telecollaborative exchange on their use of syntactic complexity in foreign language writing as well as their self-assessment and demonstration of intercultural competence. The basis for this study was a telecollaborative project between a third-year German class at a US university and an advanced English class at a German high school. The study combined the use of one-on-one, group-on-group, as well as reflective computer-mediated communication tools, and aimed at investigating cultural and linguistic competence as impacted by an electronic exchange. At the heart of the study were 19 tandem e-mail partnerships between the American learners of German and the German learners of English. The partners each wrote two e-mails per week in their target languages discussing pre-assigned cultural topics. In addition, both classes met for two class-to-class videoconferences in which they discussed cultural topics of their own interest. One of them was held in German and one in English. Additionally, there was a reflective component to the study. The American students kept a bi-weekly blog in which they reflected on their learning experience, exchanged ideas and learned from and with each other. The research questions explored the effects of the virtual exchange on the American students’ interest in cultural learning, use of syntactic complexity in their writing, self-assessment of intercultural competence, and development of intercultural competence. Based on sociocultural theory (Lantolf, 1994), pushed-output hypothesis (Swain, 1995) and Fantini’s (2000) model of intercultural competence, the analysis included qualitative and quantitative measures and incorporated a variety of data sources including e-mail transcripts, blog transcripts, student essays and pre- and post-surveys. The results showed that there was no statistically significant effect of the exchange on students’ interest in cultural learning, but that this was high both before and after the exchange. Additionally, the results revealed that the students produced texts with greater syntactic complexity at the end of the exchange as compared to the beginning of the exchange. The students’ self-assessment of intercultural competence varied and there were no significant changes. However, the qualitative analysis showed several interesting patterns in the development of intercultural competence, for example the development of cross-cultural awareness and strategies for successful cross-cultural communication. In addition, the analysis revealed a connection between the amount of words written and the overall effects of the virtual exchange on students’ intercultural competence and syntactic complexity.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-virtual-exchange-on-language-skills/docview/1038142019/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Plata Ramirez, Jose Miguel",2012,Language switching: A qualitative clinical study of four second language learners' composing processes,"Recent research about L2 writing indicates that L2 writers are likely to instruct themselves on how and what to do during the writing process, using both languages to do so. This constant switch between their L1 and their L2 during their L2 composing process is known as ""language-switching"" (L-S). In this qualitative clinical study my goals were mainly three: a) to describe and understand the purposes for which participants would potentially language-switch to their L1s, b) to depict the perceptions and understandings these four participants have about their personal L2 composing process and the use of their L1s, and c) to describe the tensions they experienced during the L2 writing tasks in the study. The participants in this study were four students in an American university who completed two L2 writing tasks using a think-aloud technique, in which students verbalized all their thoughts while they wrote. Data collected in this study included interview transcripts, think aloud protocols, reflection sessions, videotapes, students' written texts and observations. The Atlas TI computer software assisted a constant comparative method which implied a continuous comparison of all the data sources (Merriam, 2009). I matched language-switching instances with the participants' behaviors and assigned codes referring the writers' actual activities, behaviors and perceptions. Findings suggest that the L2 composing process is a bilingual event in which L-S has a natural occurrence. The use of the writer's L1 during the L2 writing process is closely related to the writer's L2 proficiency, and the degree of proficiency can be related to the situational context (FL vs. SL) where the L2 is learned and used. Findings revealed that Generating L2 Content was the most recurring purpose for L-S during L2 writing, followed by Controlling the Process of Writing and Revising. It also revealed that participants transfer their L1 skills to the L2 writing process and that the writing expertise they bring to the L2 composing process may influence the L-S purpose frequency. One contribution of this study is the participants' perceptions about their L-S habits. Most were aware of the benefits that L-S brought to their L2 writing process. Their L1s helped them organize ideas, write better texts and understand the tasks given. This study also revealed that time frame, prompts, lack of L2 proficiency and think-aloud protocols can influence the participants' L2 writing process negatively.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/language-switching-qualitative-clinical-study/docview/1030282978/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Adams, Tuuli Morrill",2011,Word Segmentation and Phonological Learning in Cross-Language Perception of Fluent Speech,"Listeners segment words from the continuous speech stream in their native language by using rhythmic structure, phrasal structure, and phonotactics (e.g. Christophe et al, 2003: McQueen, 1998). One challenging aspect of second language acquisition is the extraction of words from fluent speech, possibly because learners apply a native language segmentation strategy to the non-native language (e.g. Cutler and Norris, 1998). This dissertation investigates native English speakers' perception of a second (non-native) language, looking at the effect of native language prosody on fluent speech perception in two experiments. In Experiment 1, learners were exposed to Finnish through a word-learning exercise, followed by exposure to fluent speech. Finnish was chosen as the language because stress is always word-initial, and this is also the most frequent stress pattern in English. In Experiment 2, the non-native language was Japanese, which has no stress pattern, but instead has lexical pitch accents. After learning words and listening to fluent speech, participants in each experiment were asked to identify possible words of the language, choosing from stimulus pairs with one real word from the speech passage, and another incorrectly segmented non-word. Participants' response patterns were analyzed using ANOVAs, and generalized linear mixed effects regression models. Results for both languages indicate that listeners who participated in word-learning tasks were better at identifying possible words than those who had only listened to fluent speech. For Finnish, the combination of word learning and fluent speech listening provided a greater advantage than word learning alone, whereas for Japanese, both groups who learned words performed about the same, although the combined tasks did lead to more consistent performance across subjects. The interaction between the prosodic patterns of the native and non-native languages has a clear effect on performance in an otherwise parallel learning environment. Implications for theories of language acquisition and speech perception are considered in the analyses.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/word-segmentation-phonological-learning-cross/docview/861478372/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kashiwagi, Akiko",2011,Processing relative clauses in first and second language: A case study,"This dissertation investigates processing of English and Japanese relative clause (RC) sentences by native speakers and second/foreign language (L2) learners. Particularly, the relationship between the sentence processing and individual differences in working memory (WM) capacity was examined. The main question addressed in this study is whether the performances of L2 learners in processing RCs are similar to those of native speakers depending on one's WM capacity. Two major approaches regarding the processing of RCs have been proposed to account for the differences between the difficulty of the subject-gap and the object-gap sentences: the cost of resources taken up by temporary storage and integration when processing (Dependency Locality Theory; Gibson, 1998, 2000) and the depth of embedding of the extracted element (Structural Distance Hypothesis; O’Grady, 1987; O’Grady, Yamashita, Lee, Choo and Cho, 2000). This study also evaluated these two hypotheses and answers the question: To which hypothesis do the performances of L2 learners best correspond? Fourteen English native speakers who were Japanese language learners and 14 Japanese native speakers who were English language learners participated in the experiment, which consisted of three parts: First language (L1) and L2 reading span tests, L1 and L2 self-paced moving window reading tasks, and a L2 proficiency test. The comprehension accuracy rates of the experimental sentences and individuals' residual reading times in each region of the RC sentence types were used for comparisons. Additionally, the individual participants' sentence reading patterns were examined, so what may have been invisible on the group level analyses were revealed. The results of the experiments showed that (1) English object-gap sentences are more difficult to comprehend than English subject-gap sentences for both L1 native speakers and L2 learners, (2) Japanese subject-gap sentences are more difficult to comprehend than Japanese object-gap sentences for both L1 native speakers and L2 learners, which supported Dependency Locality Theory and (3) the differences in comprehension accuracy rates, if any, were seen between the lower WM L2 learners and the group of the higher WM L2 learners and the native speakers. The results of the individual reading pattern comparisons showed that (4) there seems to be a commonly-preferred reading pattern among the native speakers in processing the subject-gap and object-gap sentences, and (5) L2 learners who demonstrated reading patterns dissimilar to the L1 native speakers' commonly-preferred reading pattern showed a tendency of having a lower WM capacity, and both of these tended to have an effect on L2 comprehension accuracy. It was concluded that the performances of L2 learners in processing RCs can be similar or dissimilar to those of native speakers depending on one's WM capacity. It was also concluded that having a lower WM capacity seems to hinder processing a sentence in a way similar to the native speakers. Moreover, for L2 learners, being unable to process L2 sentences in the manner that is commonly preferred by the native speakers seems to lead to lower comprehension accuracy in the RC sentences, especially in the more-difficult-to-comprehend English object-gap and Japanese subject-gap sentences.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-relative-clauses-first-second-language/docview/863203207/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Yang, Chunsheng",2011,The Acquisition of Mandarin Prosody by American Learners of Chinese as a Foreign Language (CFL),"In the acquisition of second language (L2) or foreign language (FL) pronunciation, learners not only learn how to pronounce consonants and vowels (tones as well, in the case of tone languages, such as Mandarin Chinese), they also learn how to produce the vowel reduction, vowel-consonant co-articulation, and prosody. Central to this dissertation is prosody, which refers to the way that an utterance is broken up into smaller units, and the acoustic patterns of each unit at different levels, in terms of fundamental frequency (F0), duration and amplitude. In L2 pronunciation, prosody is as important as – if not more important than – consonants and vowels. This dissertation examines the acquisition of Mandarin prosody by American learners of Chinese as a Foreign Language (CFL). Specifically, it examines four aspects of Mandarin prosody: (1) prosodic phrasing (i.e., breaking up of utterances into smaller units); (2) surface F0 and duration patterns of prosodic phrasing in a group of sentence productions elicited from L1 and L2 speakers of Mandarin Chinese; (3) patterns of tones errors in L2 Mandarin productions; and (4) the relationship between tone errors and prosodic phrasing in L2 Mandarin. The analysis of prosodic phrasing in the corpus shows that prosodic phrasing is closely related to syntactic structure in both L1 and L2 Mandarin productions. Moreover, results show that the syntactic structure in a prosodic phrase does not influence the prosodic structure of that constituent in either the learner group or the native group. Analysis of the duration patterns in the L1 and L2 Mandarin corpus shows that the most consistent duration pattern that indexes prosodic phrasing is phrase-final lengthening. In addition, the duration analysis shows that the native group shows phrase-initial lengthening, the intermediate learner group produces phrase-initial shortening, and the advanced learner group displays no effect of phrasing on phrase-initial duration. This pattern of phrase-initial lengthening/shortening indicates a learning effect in that the advanced learner group patterned more similarly to the native group. We also observed the transfer of L1 English stress patterns, such as the weak versus strong alternating stress patterns in the L2 corpus. With respect to the F0 patterns of prosodic phrasing, it was found that the conflicting tone sequences (the sequences in which the target at the offset of a preceding tone and the target at the onset of the following tone are different) posed more difficulty for learners than the compatible tone sequences (the sequences in which the target at the offset of a preceding tone and the target at the onset of a following tone are identical). In addition, the productions by the native speakers involved more target undershoot (namely, the tone targets are not fully realized) than those by the L2 learners. It was also found that the tone target undershoot mostly occurred in the first prosodic phrase of an utterance. The transfer of English intonation patterns was also observed, such as the transfer of a high phrase accent at the end of a prosodic phrase. Analysis of tone errors shows that the low and rising tones were the most frequent tone errors produced by the two groups of learners in their L2 Mandarin productions, regardless of the underlying tones. The patterns of tone errors in different tone sequences suggest that the learners not only had difficulty in changing the tone targets quickly in the conflicting tone sequences, they also had difficulty in changing the F0 direction quickly in the compatible tone sequences. It is argued that these tone errors were produced as a consequence of the superimposition of the L1 English utterance-level prosody over tone production by L2 learners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-mandarin-prosody-american-learners/docview/863203226/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ortactepe, Deniz",2011,The development of conceptual socialization in Turkish international students: A language socialization perspective on conceptual fluency and social identity,"This longitudinal, mixed-method study relied on the assumption that international students as newcomers to the American culture experience conceptual socialization which enables them to gain competency in the target language through exposure to the target language culture. By collecting qualitative and quantitative data three times over a year, the present study examined the linguistic and social development of Turkish international students as a result of their conceptual socialization in the U.S. The stories of participating Turkish students provided evidence for the multi-faceted nature of identity (re)construction which required a closer look at not only the participants’ investment, audibility and symbolic capital but also the role of external resources such as social networks, empowering relationships and the socio-physical structure of the new country. On the other hand, the quantitative findings suggested that the acquisition of formulaic language follows a non-linear, U-shaped process that relies on trial-and-error and is objected to L1 transfer and overgeneralization. Overall, this study’s conclusions centered around four main issues: (a) Language learning is as much a process of socialization as it is of acquisition, (b) This process should be re-defined as conceptual socialization rather than L2 socialization, (c) Study abroad sojourners should be informed about the language myth, and (d) L2 learners’ conceptual socialization rely on their investment rather than extended social networks. The findings of this study provided suggestions for future research as well as theoretical, practical, and teaching implications regarding, (a) the role higher education institutions in the United States to address the needs of international students, (b) current theories concerning international students, (c) teaching practices that would facilitate the development of L2 pragmatic competence as well as foster “hybrid identities” for global language learners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-conceptual-socialization-turkish/docview/864547899/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Al Khalil, Maymona Khalil",2011,"Second language motivation: Its relationship to noticing, affect, and production in task-based interaction","Second language (L2) motivation has been characterized as a complex construct comprised of cognitive, affective, and behavioral components (Gardner, 1985, 2001, 2006). This research explored whether components of L2 motivation significantly related to cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of task-based interaction—specifically, the cognitive dimension of noticing of recasts; the affective dimensions of task satisfaction, task relevance, and task difficulty; and the behavioral dimensions of accuracy, complexity, and fluency of L2 production. Second language motivation was operationalized in accordance with measures adapted from three qualitatively distinct theoretical conceptualizations: the traditionally investigated socio-educational model of second language acquisition (Gardner, 1985, 2001, 2006), the situated perspective of state motivation (Gardner &amp; Tremblay, 1998; Julkunen, 1989, 2001; Tennant &amp; Gardner, 2004; Tremblay, Goldberg, &amp; Gardner, 1995), and the more recently proposed L2 motivational self-system (Dörnyei, 2005, 2009a). Forty-four intermediate learners of Arabic completed a motivation questionnaire, took part in a video-taped task-based interaction with a native speaker interlocutor, and then returned one day later for a stimulated-recall session addressing clipped episodes from their task-based interaction. Ratings of task satisfaction, task relevance, and task difficulty were obtained from participants after each of the six tasks used during interaction. Results indicated that attitudes towards the L2 community, a component of integrativeness in the socio-educational model, significantly predicted reported noticing of recasts. Also, state motivation significantly correlated with task satisfaction and task relevance. As for L2 production, the aggregate construct of motivation, as defined by the socio-educational model, significantly predicted accuracy, complexity, and fluency in four participants, the two most-motivated and the two least- motivated in the sample. No measures from the L2 motivational self-system were found to be associated with noticing of recasts or L2 production. Thus, in addition to empirically confirming important associations between L2 motivation and cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of task-based interaction, the results highlighted the superior sensitivity of socio-educational measures in identifying meaningful relationships with L2 motivation in learners of Arabic as a foreign language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-motivation-relationship-noticing/docview/865316114/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Sachs, Rebecca Raewyn",2011,Individual differences and the effectiveness of visual feedback on reflexive binding in L2 Japanese,"Second language acquisition research into the effects of corrective feedback has investigated a variety of learning targets using a wide range of implicit and explicit feedback types (Li, 2010). To date, however, its linguistic focus has been limited to theoretically noticeable surface features (Carroll, 2001; Schmidt, 2001), and researchers have only recently begun to explore how individual differences might influence the effectiveness of particular feedback techniques (Robinson, 2005). This dissertation examines whether metalinguistic feedback presented in a visual format can help English-speaking learners improve their accuracy in interpreting the Japanese reflexive zibun (‘self’), whose binding behavior involves structural characteristics (e.g., c-command, subjecthood) not overtly represented in surface morphosyntax. Both positive and negative evidence may be necessary since, unlike English himself, Japanese zibun allows long-distance antecedents while disallowing non-subject antecedents (Thomas, 1995). In a computer-assisted language learning experiment using a pre-/post-/delayed-post-test design, 80 university Japanese learners were randomly assigned into three treatment conditions: one informing them whether or not their interpretations were correct (Right/Wrong Feedback), one informing them of correctness and illustrating relevant structural relationships with tree diagrams (Trees Feedback), and one providing no feedback. Participants were also administered a battery of cognitive tests, including the Modern Language Aptitude Test (Carroll &amp; Sapon, 1959), the Visual Patterns Test (Della Sala et al., 1997), and a test of metalinguistic knowledge and sensitivity to ambiguity. Results indicated clear evidence of improvement only in the Trees-Feedback group, and cognitive variables showed different relationships with test performance according to treatment condition: Visual memory, grammatical sensitivity, rote memory, and sensitivity to ambiguity predicted post-test scores in the Trees-Feedback condition; course levels and length of Japanese study predicted scores in the Right/Wrong-Feedback condition; and grammatical sensitivity, metalinguistic knowledge, and formal study of linguistics predicted scores in the No-Feedback condition. Thus, visual feedback can facilitate the learning of a linguistic target which involves underlying structural relationships, but may work best for learners with particular aptitude profiles. Analyses of aptitude-treatment interactions hold great promise for advancing the field of SLA through producing insights about language learning processes and helping to optimize L2 instruction in relation to learners’ individual characteristics.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/individual-differences-effectiveness-visual/docview/865835184/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Houser, Nicole M.",2011,Moving beyond “second” and “foreign”: An examination of the discursive construction of teaching English and Spanish,"This dissertation explores how teaching Spanish and English as second languages in the United States has been traditionally defined, the common assumptions that are held about each context, and the influence these assumptions have on instructional practices and student learning. In order to explore how teaching English and Spanish is constructed in a local context, I employ a Foucauldian discourse analytical approach in conjunction with ethnographic methods to provide detailed descriptions of an Intensive English Program (IEP) and a Spanish Program at one university. I then contextualize this particular site within the larger professional and societal discourses surrounding the instruction of both languages. My study revealed that by comparing the discourses and practices of both contexts participants make contradictory and limiting assumptions concerning student goals and motivations as well as curricular organization and instructional practices in both settings. My research illustrates how participant interpretations of each context are highly influenced by what has traditionally been considered ""normal"" for teaching Spanish and English as second languages. While some contextual factors contributed to these differences, these divisions are essentially arbitrary, and potentially limiting to how we conceptualize teaching and learning in both settings.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/moving-beyond-second-foreign-examination/docview/867369698/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Jeon, Seonkyung",2011,Second language acquisition of Korean progressive,"This dissertation examines second language (L2) acquisition of the Korean progressive by native English speakers and native Japanese speakers. We investigate first language (L1) transfer and form-to-meaning mapping, focusing on the acquisition of two possible interpretations of the Korean progressive. In English, Japanese and Korean, the progressives interact differently with the lexical aspect of the verb. The English progressive encodes the ongoing interpretation, whereas the Japanese and Korean progressives encode not only the resultative interpretation but also the ongoing interpretation. Based on these crosslinguistic differences, we assume that learners start with their L1 in acquiring aspectual semantics and predict that L1-English learners and L1-Japanese learners show different acquisitional patterns. Furthermore, we predict that L1-English learners restructure native form-to-meaning mapping based on positive input. This dissertation investigates these issues by testing adult English speakers and Japanese speakers of various proficiency levels. In the experiments two main tasks were used: the Story Completion Task and the Truth Value Judgment Task. The results of the tasks revealed that L1-English learners acquire the ongoing interpretation of the progressive - ko iss earlier than the resultative interpretation. However, L1-Japanese learners performed similarly on the ongoing interpretation of the progressive - ko iss and the resultative interpretation. The results suggest L1 transfer effects in acquiring the progressive, ruling out the universal developmental order, that is, prototype-based explanation. The results of the study of L1-English learners indicate that L2 learners could restructure form-to-meaning mapping based on positive input. However, acquisition of the resultative interpretation gradually occurred with individual variations.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-korean-progressive/docview/884340990/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Plonsky, Luke",2011,"Study quality in SLA: A cumulative and developmental assessment of designs, analyses, reporting practices, and outcomes in quantitative L2 research","I began this study with two assumptions. Assumption 1: Study quality matters. If the means by which researchers design, carry out, and report on their studies lack in rigor or transparency, theory and practice are likely to be misguided or at least decelerated. Assumption 2 is an implication of Assumption 1: Quality should be measured rather than assumed. Although peer reviews and researcher training in second language acquisition (SLA) are generally considered to be acceptable and thorough, there is very little evidence of the extent of methodological rigor, consistency, and transparency across second language (L2) research. Beyond these assumptions, this study drew from previous research in several different fields. Central to this paper was the research on study quality which has received considerable attention in the context of research synthetic and meta-analytic methods. Because of the shared historical and methodological tradition of SLA and psychology (e.g., Gass, 1993), I consulted as well the American Psychological Association's guidelines for research when developing the instrument used in this study. Much of the empirical motivation for this project also came from within the field of SLA. Previous reviews have raised concerns about methodological practices across a number of subdomains, warranting further and more comprehensive investigation. The first two of four questions posed by the present study asked about the use of study designs and analyses (RQ1) and reporting practices (RQ2) in L2 research. My third question sought to measure the relationship between research practices and outcomes (i.e., effect sizes) found in L2 research (see Plonsky &amp; Gass, 2011). And research question four asked whether and to what extent research practices and outcomes in SLA have changed in recent years. The purpose underlying these questions and the study more generally was not only to better understand conventions in the field but to inform future research practices as well. In order to answer these questions and meet the study's larger purpose, a representative sample of L2 research published in two L2 journals from 1990 to 2010 was collected. Using research synthetic techniques, I surveyed the sample of studies, 606 in total, using a modified version of the instrument used by Plonsky and Gass (2011) in their investigation of study quality in the interactionist tradition of SLA. The coding scheme was designed to extract information related to study identification, design features, analyses, reporting practices, and effect sizes. Descriptive statistics were then calculated for study features to answer the research questions. The overall results of this study point to a number of systematic strengths as well as many flaws across the corpus of L2 research. Of particular concern are incomplete and inconsistent reporting practices (e.g., means without standard deviations) and low statistical power, among other issues. Somewhat surprisingly and in contrast to previous findings (e.g., Plonsky, in press), there was very little evidence of a relationship between study quality and effect sizes, a finding that may reflect the broad substantive scope of the study and field. Finally, comparing research practices over the 1990s and 2000s, I found substantial improvements in almost all categories. The discussion situates the results in terms of reviews from SLA and other fields (e.g., education; Skidmore &amp; Thompson, 2010), shedding light on the methodological and analytical trends and trajectories observed. Based on the findings of the study, I make pointed suggestions for methodological reforms to be enacted by institutions such as the American Association for Applied Linguistics and individuals (e.g., independent researchers, journal editors).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/study-quality-sla-cumulative-developmental/docview/888043507/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Takami, Naoko",2011,Acquisition of semantic and pragmatic meaning of the quantifier <i> nanko-k</i> by adult learners of Japanese,"This study investigated how the Japanese quantifier nanko-ka , which is one of the counterparts of English nanko-ka , is interpreted by adult learners of Japanese. English nanko-ka has two distinguished meanings: a semantic meaning 'a certain number of' and a pragmatic meaning 'not all.' And according to Slabakova (2010), learners of English tend to interpret nanko-ka more pragmatically than native speakers of English. However, it has not investigated yet whether the Japanese nanko-ka has two different interpretations as well. Additionally, Japanese nanko-ka , nanko-ka , is morphologically more complicated than English nanko-ka , and it is not likely to be directly explained in a Japanese foreign language classroom teaching. Considering these facts, this study examined i) whether learners of Japanese can associate nanko-ka as a counterpart of English nanko-ka , and ii) if so, whether learners of Japanese can interpret nanko-ka in a native-like way. 20 advanced Japanese learners and 19 Japanese native speakers participated in this study. The main task, providing the pragmatically enriched storyboards was conducted in order to see how nanko-ka is interpreted. Besides, one additional task for the learners investigated how well learners could associate nanko-ka with nanko-ka , and another additional task for the natives examined whether Japanese nanko-ka , nanko-ka has two different interpretations like English nanko-ka . The results showed that the learners tend not to have intuitiveness to associate nanko-ka with nanko-ka without direct input of the explanation of nanko-ka as a quantifier; however, once they could associate, even learners perform the interpretation of nanko-ka in a native-like way. Another finding is that Japanese nanko-ka , nanko-ka seems not to be interpreted in a same way as the English nanko-ka in terms of its semantic interpretation in a certain context. Additionally, the nanko-ka which semantically true but pragmatically infelicitous is interpreted more ambiguous compared to the nanko-ka by not only learners of Japanese but also native speakers of Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-semantic-pragmatic-meaning-quantifier/docview/888508684/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Wakefield, John C.",2011,The English Equivalents of Cantonese Sentence-final Particles: A Contrastive Analysis,"Cantonese has a lexical tone system that severely restricts its ability to manipulate pitch. As a result, many of the speaker-oriented discourse meanings that are expressed through intonation in languages such as English are expressed in the form of sentence-final particles (SFPs) in Cantonese. Although this is widely known and accepted by linguists, apparently no study to date has made a systematic attempt to discover whether any of the more than 30 Cantonese SFPs have English intonational equivalents, and if so, what those equivalents are. To work towards filling this research gap, this study examines the English intonational equivalents of four Cantonese SFPs that divide into the following two pairs: particles of obviousness: lo1 and aa1maa3 ; question particles: me1 and aa4. The English equivalent form of each of the four SFPs of this study is identified by examining the pitch contours of Cantonese-to-English audio translations, provided by Cantonese/English native-bilingual participants. A definition using Wierzbicka's (1996) natural semantic metalanguage (NSM) is proposed for each SFP, which is hypothesized to apply equally to its English intonational counterpart. Following proposals of Hirst's (1983a) regarding ""emphatic intonation,"" these pitch contours are proposed to be floating tones that exist as lexical entries in the minds of native-English speakers. Syntactic positions are proposed for the SFPs and their English equivalents adopting Rizzi's (1997) split-CP hypothesis. The findings of this study have far reaching implications regarding the descriptions and classifications of intonation, as well as regarding the classifications of the various forms of suprasegmentals. This study used segmental discourse markers to discover their suprasegmental counterparts in English, exploiting a unique window through which to examine the forms and meanings of English discourse intonation, which is one of the least understood and most difficult to study aspects of English. This research has arguably provided the strongest and clearest evidence to date regarding the forms and meanings of the particular forms of English intonation with which it deals.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/english-equivalents-cantonese-sentence-final/docview/890234515/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Miyata, Munehiko",2011,"The effects of frequency, distribution, mode of presentation, and first language on learning an artificial language","This dissertation presents results from a series of experiments investigating adult learning of an artificial language and the effects that input frequency (high vs. low token frequency), frequency distribution (skewed vs. balanced), presentation mode (structured vs. scrambled), and first language (English vs. Japanese) have on such learning. Motivated by cognitive and usage-based accounts of language and learning, the research aims to contribute to theoretical debates concerning the influence of input properties and existing knowledge in language learning. The artificial language used in the experiments is focused on the learning of noun classes modeled on Nilo-Saharan languages. Two artificial noun classes, each with distinct morphological features, were devised based on a semantic contrast between entities that are typically encountered as individuals and those typically encountered as groups, sets, pairs or masses. A total of 150 subjects, college students and young adult native speakers of English and Japanese with no more than limited knowledge of the other language, participated in these experiments. In each experiment, subjects were exposed to words and pictures representing the two noun classes. The learning phase was followed by a testing phase to assess their learning with respect to both trained and previously unseen exemplars of each class. A two-factor factorial analysis of variance design was used to analyze the results. The results show that presentation mode had the largest effect on learning, followed by token frequency and frequency distribution. The results also show a constant effect of L1 knowledge: participants were better at learning morphological features similar to their L1 than dissimilar ones. These findings contribute new knowledge to our understanding of the learning of functional morphology—which has been viewed as a major theoretical challenge by researchers working within such diverse perspectives as the processing-instructional paradigm and generative SLA—and leads to pedagogical implications that may benefit learners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-frequency-distribution-mode-presentation/docview/892026308/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Izumi, Yurika",2011,Creating cohesion in the process of second language writing,"Cohesive ties in Japanese texts written by five intermediate Japanese language learners were explored in order to observe how they create cohesion. The analysis of written data, their process of creating cohesion, and the interview results indicated that the way the Japanese learners create cohesion was different from their first language and that of Japanese native speakers. The cohesive ties which have equivalent ties in English were used more frequently and with less variety in the students' Japanese texts compared to their texts written in their first language and Japanese texts written by Japanese native speakers; whereas, the use of the cohesive ties which do not have their equivalent linguistic form in English were restricted. The qualitative analysis revealed that the incohesion in students' Japanese texts were affected by cognitive overload and lack of awareness of cohesive ties. Learning Experience Approach was proposed to remedy these problems.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/creating-cohesion-process-second-language-writing/docview/902873314/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Gonzalez, Carolina",2011,Perception of prosody in American Sign Language,"The main goal of this dissertation is to examine the ability to use prosodic cues when parsing Intonational Phrases (IPs) in American Sign Language (ASL) by four different populations, i.e. ASL signers, Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL) signers, Non-Signers and second language (L2) signers of ASL. ASL signers, Non-Signers and L2 signers showed similar performance in terms of accuracy when identifying prosodic boundaries. Although hearing participants (i.e. Non-Signers and L2 signers) do not have a phonology for gestures, they are able to use superficial visual cues to mark prosodic boundaries based on their “gestural competence”; that is, their experience using co-speech gesture. Native HKSL signers’ performance was better overall demonstrating a greater ability to be accurate and fast when parsing ASL clauses than even native ASL signers. I argue that the ASL signers’ ability may be affected by lexical or semantic interference. Long reaction times and low accuracy levels revealed the complexity of the mental process involved in this task. When data were analyzed within group, Non-Signers as well as L2 signers showed a better performance when stimuli contained more cues. Contrary to hearing participants, the native signers groups did not show changes on accuracy depending on the number of cues. Data shows that 3-4 cues are sufficient for HKSL and ASL signers to be accurate, whereas Non-Signers and L2 signers needed more cues. HKSL signers as well as Non-Signers and L2 signers parse ASL clauses based on a broader range of cues whereas ASL signers focus just on a couple of cues when parsing ASL clauses, that is, ASL signers are sensitive to fewer cues.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/perception-prosody-american-sign-language/docview/904416342/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Wu, Shu-Ling",2011,Learning to express motion events in L2 Chinese: A cognitive linguistic perspective,"Research has shown that speakers of different languages conceptualize motion events in a language-specific manner. First-language (L1) predispositions for spatial organization or event construal have the potential to exert influence on second-language (L2) acquisition of motion expressions. Chinese, like English, is traditionally considered to be a satellite-framed language (Talmy, 1985, 1991, 2000). However, as a serial-verb language, Chinese exhibits different lexicalization patterns from English with respect to path encoding. Adopting the framework of Talmy (1985, 1991, 2000) for typological classification of motion events as well as Slobin's thinking-for-speaking (TFS) hypothesis (Slobin, 1987, 1996a), this dissertation offers an intra-typological comparison of Chinese and English and examines the various contributing factors that influence the use and acquisition of L2 Chinese motion expressions by adult L1 English speakers. This study employed a multi-task approach, including a picture-cued written task, an oral narrative task, and an online judgment task, to measure learners' L2 TFS performance across different modalities. It discusses the behavior of 80 L2 Chinese learners at two proficiency levels, including participants with heritage background as well as those of foreign language background, as compared to two baseline groups of 40 Chinese native speakers (NSs) and 40 English NSs. The learners' performance was inspected according to their proficiency level and language background and was compared with that of the NS groups. The results of this study show that L2 speakers' development in learning to describe motion events in Chinese is influenced by factors including their L2 proficiency level, the degree of syntactic and semantic complexity of the L2 subsystems, construal of L2 motion constructions, and language background. These factors go beyond a simple dichotomy of L1 or L2 thinking, and together they suggest that the influence of L1 TFS, like other kinds of L1 transfer phenomena, are sensitive to probabilistic tendencies. Conceptual changes in the course of L2 acquisition of motion expressions are dynamic and ongoing processes, in which multiple factors can come into play to determine whether or how L1 TFS affects L2 learning outcomes. Notably, among these factors, learners' embodied experiences for communicative use of motion expressions play a vital role in their internalization of L2 TFS.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/learning-express-motion-events-l2-chinese/docview/907104264/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zaremba, Kathryn Davidson",2011,The Nature of the Semantic Scale: Evidence from Sign Language Research,"A difficult learning problem for both children and artificial language learning systems is knowing what is intended to be conveyed based on what is literally said. For example, adults usually take ""Some teas contain caffeine"" to also convey that ""Not all teas contain caffeine"", an inference known as a scalar implicature. The present work investigates the role of language-specific knowledge in such inferences through three studies on scalar implicatures in American Sign Language (ASL). The first study illustrates a new experimental paradigm and compares prototypical scalar implicatures in ASL and English. The second study includes the first investigation of general use coordinators in ASL that can be interpreted as either conjunction (""and"") or disjunction (""or""). This provides a test case for the role of language-specific lexical contrast in scalar implicatures, with results showing that lexically non-contrastive scales (i.e., lexical scales whose items differ in meaning but not in form) trigger less scalar implicatures than prototypical lexically contrastive scales, which are based on contrasting lexical items. In the third study, both lexically contrastive and non-contrastive scales are interpreted by deaf native signers and also deaf signers who learned ASL at later ages. Result show that later ASL learners calculated less implicatures than early learning signers, but only on the lexically contrastive scale. Together, these studies support a view that despite their context dependence, scalar implicatures are most likely to be triggered by lexical items which contrast with each other in form to create a context-independent ""scale"", and that there may even be advantages to learning scales early in life. The dissertation concludes with suggestions for incorporating lexical contrast into theories of implicature and for further study of the semantic/pragmatic interface in sign languages.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/nature-semantic-scale-evidence-sign-language/docview/913399804/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Cho, Yongjoon",2011,Multiple nominative construction in Korean and its second language acquisition by adult English speakers,"The thesis deals with the problem of ultimate attainment in second language acquisition research. In other words, it is about whether second language learners can achieve native-like linguistic competence of their target language. Particularly, it investigates to what extent second language learners reach a steady state in their acquisition, and whether the steady state of native speakers qualitatively differs. The research presented in the thesis supports the idea that the ultimate attainment of a second language is partially achievable, which has been dubbed as ‘Interface Hypothesis.’ The hypothesis insists that interfaces between linguistic modules, such as syntax-morphology interface and syntax-pragmatics interface, present difficulty in second language acquisition up to and including ultimate attainment, while pure syntax can be acquired successfully according to the increased general proficiency of adult second language speakers. For this purpose, the multiple nominative construction in Korean was taken as a testing ground in the thesis. The construction refers to the situation where, unlike English, more than one nominative phrase is permitted in a single clause. This construction is ideal to test if ultimate attainment is partially attainable and what area is vulnerable, since the two different types of construction, Nominative Object Construction (NOC) and Multiple Subject Construction (MSC), manifest different grammatical modules they implicate. NOC is not related to any interface and is simply licensed by a pure syntactic operation. On the other hand, MSC requires correct functioning of the syntax-pragmatics interface. Because of this difference in grammatical modules required, it is predicted that the acquisition of the latter (MSC) is more constrained than the former (NOC). The results of the experiments conducted in the thesis confirm this prediction. For NOC, beginning and intermediate learners evidence their incompleteness in its acquisition. However, once complete restructuring of interlanguage grammars is achieved with respect to proper Korean syntactic case mechanisms, the results of the experiments show that these errors are overcome. In contrast, such improvement is not evident with respect to MSC, which requires syntax-pragmatic licensing, indicating greater difficulty with acquisition of the syntax-pragmatics interface. The research in the thesis concomitantly provides quantitative L2 acquisition data for the still-controversial issue concerning the distinction between NOCs and MSCs in Korean.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/multiple-nominative-construction-korean-second/docview/916590459/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Natale Rukholm, Vanessa",2011,Facilitating Lexical Acquisition in Beginner Learners of Italian Through Popular Song,"This study examines the effects of Song and Involvement Load on the acquisition and retention of lexical items by beginner learners of Italian. Lexical acquisition is investigated via an incidental learning experiment that is based on the premise that growth in L2 vocabulary results from rehearsal and repeated exposure to lexical items in a variety of contexts. More specifically, the study hypothesizes that Song contributes to subvocal rehearsal, a mechanism that facilitates the retention of phonological information. In addition, the study hypothesizes that Involvement Load, as posited by Laufer and Hulstijn (2001), contributes to retention through ""elaborate processing"" (Craik &amp; Tulving, 1975) of lexical items. In order to evaluate participants' lexical acquisition, an experiment with pretest/posttest design was carried out. Participants were divided into one of five groups consisting of a Control Group and four treatment groups. Treatment groups were exposed to a Song either in a sung condition or read as a poem (i.e. without music) while the Control Group completed only the pretest and posttests. Treatment groups also completed lexical tasks designed with either low or high levels of Involvement Load. The pretest and posttests (administered at four and eight weeks respectively after the pretest) were based on Paribakht and Wesche's (1996) Vocabulary Knowledge Scale. It was hypothesized that in the case of both short-term acquisition (four weeks after the pretest) and retention (eight weeks thereafter) (i) participants exposed to Song would obtain higher scores than participants only exposed to the lyrics; (ii) participants completing High Involvement tasks would score higher than participants completing Low Involvement tasks; and (iii) the effects of Song would be greater than the effects of Involvement Load on test scores. Results indicated that at both posttests, participants exposed to Song obtained higher scores than participants only exposed to lyrics ( p =0.004). Additionally, participants carrying out High Involvement tasks scored higher than participants carrying out Low Involvement tasks ( p =0.017). However, a comparison of the strength of the effects of Song and Involvement Load on acquisition and retention of target items yielded inconclusive results ( p =.383). The validation of many of the hypotheses suggests that song and involvement load are effective in the acquisition and retention of L2 lexical items and should be implemented in the L2 curriculum.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/facilitating-lexical-acquisition-beginner/docview/917798354/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kozuma, Jo A.",2011,The role of social networks in the linguistic and cultural integration and reintegration of Japanese return migrants,"Return migration is a population movement where people return to their country of origin after a period of time living in another country. This study explores the linguistic and cultural roles that social networks play in return migration. Six Japanese women who stayed in the United States for less than five years and who have since returned to Japan within the last 12-18 months filled out questionnaires and participated in ethnographic interviews. An analysis of their stories suggests that due to their cyclical migration pattern, the structures and functions of the social networks for return migrants were different from those studied previously for immigrant groups. The return migrants established temporary interactive networks that were short-term, highly valued with strong ties and were accessed only for the duration of the return migrants‘ stay in the host culture. The study also indicated that due to the limited time spent in the host culture, the findings from the Japanese return migrants revealed that a) linguistic and cultural maintenance is not always the motivating factor for adults to establish an L1 social network; b) membership into an L1 social network is not always automatic; c) the need to have an L1 social network in the host culture is related to the values and norms of the home culture because it helps to enforce the return migrants‘ self-identity as Japanese; and d) L2 social networks in the host culture that are comprised of international members do not facilitate the development of a bilingual/bicultural identity. In terms of language proficiency, this study discovered that for the Japanese return migrants, self-perception of low L2 proficiency led the return migrants to establish alternative L2 temporary social networks of international speakers of English. The international bilingual social network was not strengthened by cultural, racial, or ethnical factors but by the common trait that English was their second language. The findings confirm the importance of distinguishing social networks of return migrants and offer a challenge to reevaluate and redefine social networks in order to broaden the social network framework to include the linguistic and cultural complexity of return migrants.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-social-networks-linguistic-cultural/docview/922400304/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Bushnell, Cade C.",2011,"Interactionally constructing practice, community, shared resources, and identity: An ethnomethodological analysis of interactions at conversation analytic data sessions in Japan","The present study uses conversation analysis and membership categorization analysis to examine a series of conversation analytic data sessions taking place at a Japanese university. The data sessions were self-organized research meetings at which a group of master's and doctoral students at the university came together to perform joint analysis of segments of interactional data being used in their respective research. The objective of the present study is to investigate the ways in which several of the core notions of the communities of practice (CoP) framework, that is, practice, community, shared repertoire, identity, and learning as a transformation of identity within a community of practice, interface with empirical descriptions of the interactional and discursive practices of the participants as they work to accomplish their activities in a mutually recognizable manner. In order to accomplish this objective, this study first provides a comprehensive description of the various activity phases accomplished and organized by the participants at their meetings, and the ways in which they treat the final activity of doing group data analysis as being their culminating and main practice. Second, the analyses show how the participants use certain terminology during their participation in doing data analysis, and how such terminology use is implicated in their co-constitution of their group as a community, and in working up and managing identities within that community. The participants' interactional management of identity across several series of interactional moments is also examined, and the ways in which shifts or changes in identity are made publicly visible and mutually recognizable in and through displays of changes in participatory behavior in using terminology during participation in doing data analysis are described. Through providing a detailed description of the actual interactional practices deployed by the participants during their participation in doing data analysis, the present study works to respecify, in interactional terms, the notions of practice, community, shared repertoire, identity, and learning as identity transformation. It is hoped that the present study can provide a model of engagement through respecification for subsequent conversation analytic research seeking to engage exogenous theoretical frameworks such as CoP.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interactionally-constructing-practice-community/docview/955181424/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"White, Angie B.",2012,A communication approach to confronting poverty: Creating interactional capital and building cross-class community through collective communicative practices in the Boulder County Circles campaign,"This qualitative, ethnographic research study documented the use and effects of collective communicative practices (CCPs) employed by an organization, called Circles, that aims to create community among a group of diverse people from different socioeconomic classes, including those who currently live in poverty, for the purpose of aiding the efforts of those who are impoverished to move out of poverty. Using data collected from participant interviews, questionnaires, participant-observation, and Circles documents, the research findings suggest a new conception of the communication being promoted through Circles, called interactional capital, which describes the types of communication and other communicative resources that facilitate the creation and maintenance of social capital through interactions with others. The discussion chapter examines the nature and impact of interactional capital on participants at the individual, collective, and societal levels; and it explicates implications of the study, both theoretically—with respect to relationships among poverty, communication, and community—and practically, with regard to what lessons learned from this analysis suggest might be best practices for antipoverty programs, including Circles.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/communication-approach-confronting-poverty/docview/1017702931/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hsu, Jui Fang",2012,Learning Chinese characters: A comparative study of the learning strategies of Western students and Eastern Asian students in Taiwan,"Vocabulary acquisition is central to learning Chinese as second or foreign language. Little research has been conducted on vocabulary learning strategies in this area. Even less study has been conducted whether students from different native language background would apply vocabulary learning strategies differently. The present study was designed to address this gap. The major concern of this study was to explore whether students from Western alphabetic countries and students from Eastern Asian countries would apply different vocabulary learning strategies in Chinese vocabulary acquisition. All the participants are international students who currently reside in Taiwan and attending the same American School located in Taipei, Taiwan. Learning Chinese is mandatory in the school. An on line survey instrument was used to collect data from the students. Descriptive statistics were used. An independent samples t-test was used to assess whether students of different native language background showed significant differences in the application of vocabulary learning strategies.

"Volynsky, Maria",2012,Encoding of motion events in the two languages of Russian-English bilinguals,"The purpose of the present study was to examine the encoding of motion in the two languages of Russian-English bilinguals who differed in their ages of arrival in the United States. Three groups of participants took part in the study: 38 L1 Russian speakers, 31 L1 English speakers and 30 Russian-English bilinguals who differed in the ages of arrival in the US (10 early, 10 childhood, and 10 late bilinguals). The participants produced oral narratives elicited with two books, Frog, Where Are You? (Mayer, 1969) and One Frog Too Many (Mayer &amp; Mayer, 1975), with bilingual participants producing narratives in both of their languages. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the data revealed several differences between L1 Russian and English speakers, including the obligatory encoding of manner of motion in Russian but not in English, where narrators also used generic motion verbs, such as to come or to go . In the context of these differences bilinguals in all three groups were shown to perform in accordance with specific language constraints in both of their languages. At the same time, Russian-English bilinguals used fewer motion verbs in L1 Russian and displayed lower levels of lexical diversity than L1 Russian speakers. The analyses revealed no effects of the age of arrival on the maintenance of L1 Russian, nor of the L1 Russian on the motion talk in L2 English. The findings of the study deepen our understanding of motion encoding in bilingual speakers. They also have important theoretical implications, suggesting that Talmy's dichotomy may be too broad in grouping together languages, such as Russian and English, which display dramatic differences in encoding of motion.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/encoding-motion-events-two-languages-russian/docview/1022180048/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Aguilera Rodriguez, Ma. de Jesus Laura",2012,Spelling: Processes and strategies in print and computer formats,"Research addressing the role of format on spellers' abilities to recognize and correct errors has neglected to incorporate the variables of error type and strategic engagement in their studies. Thus, the three experiments in this dissertation examined the abilities of various types of spellers (above average, average, below average, and second language) across print and computer formats. The experiments introduced the role of attention as a factor in error blindness (i.e., inability to detect mistakes) for spelling recognition tasks, and the role of working memory in the graded quality of mental representations for spelling production tasks (i.e., correction of misspellings). In each experiment, spellers were randomly assigned to one of four counterbalanced groups. Spellers were asked to detect and correct misspelling for two essays in print and computer formats, identifying the spelling strategies applied. The studies compared word knowledge levels to error detection and correction abilities; attentional and working memory processes accounted for the influence of the type of error and format on spelling performance. Findings demonstrated inherent processing differences between spelling recognition and production processes and the masking effects of the application of strategies on spelling accuracy. Effects of error type in terms of saliency and clarity were found as phonological errors were easier to detect and correct, but morphological errors were more prone to error blindness regardless of the format. Spellers' quality of mental representations remained equally accessible due to their grounding in orthography. Format alone did not have an effect on accuracy, but did have an effect on strategic engagement. Format evidenced higher cognitive demands in the computer format and when spellers switched work from computer to print. These changes were explained by the operations of a modulatory mechanism that inhibits the kind of information to be processed in the graphemic buffer. It is concluded that language processing models (e.g., Owen &amp; Borowsky, 2003) can account for these findings by including the function of lexical strategies in reading and spelling tasks.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/spelling-processes-strategies-print-computer/docview/1027139745/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Yin, Bin",2012,Investigating Chinese speakers' acquisition of telicity in English,"This dissertation is concerned with Chinese speakers' acquisition of telicity in L2 English. Telicity is a semantic notion having to do with whether an event has an inherent endpoint or not. Most existing work on L2 telicity is conceptualized within an L1-transfer framework and examines learning situations where L1 and L2 differ on whether and how the Direct Object plays a role in telicity computation (e.g., Slabakova 2000, 2001, 2005; Gabriele, 2010; Kaku-MacDonald, 2009). This dissertation is inspired by such prior work but explores additional issues by examining not only the role of the Direct Object, but also constructions where other elements in the sentence contribute to telicity, including the Goal PPs, Adjectival Resultatives, and the Locatum construction. A series of three sentence-rating experiments examined these constructions, and the results yield insights into the different factors affecting telicity acquisition: learnability (Chapter 2), transparency in form-meaning mapping (Chapter 3), and the role of underlying syntactic operations (Chapter 4). It was found that for native Mandarin speakers learning English, un-learning an L1-based but L2-incompatible telicity interpretation proved to be comparatively challenging, which can be attributed to the absence of negative evidence. Furthermore, even in situations where L1 and L2 do not differ in their telicity, participants were more likely to arrive at the correct telicity interpretation of a sentence in the L2 in situations where the construction encoding telicity was more transparent—in terms of its form-meaning mapping—than in situations where the construction was less so. Moreover, telicity was easier to learn when it was marked on the verb than when it was marked on the noun. Lastly, unlike what has been found for child learners (Hodgson, 2006, 2009, 2010), the L2 learners in this research did not show sensitivity to the differences between covert versus overt syntactic operations that are responsible for telicity computation. In sum, by investigating a wider range of constructions than has hitherto been examined, this dissertation shows that a multiplicity of factors (and not just the Direct Object) contribute to the acquisition of telicity.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigating-chinese-speakers-acquisition/docview/1027591923/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Mroz, Aurore Patricia",2012,Nature of L2 negotiation and co-construction of meaning in a problem-based virtual learning environment: A mixed methods study,"Adopting a Socio-Constructivist theoretical framework, this study investigated the French language discourse produced by a focal group of five intermediate learners of French while immersed in a virtual learning environment (VLE) and engaged in a problem-based activity. Adopting a mixed methods approach, this study analyzed both quantitative and qualitative data to examine the second language (L2) negotiation and co-construction of meaning process in this group's discourse; as well, it investigated these learners' emerging L2 critical thinking, problem solving, and technology literacy skills. Results indicated that the discourse produced by these students was significantly impacted by the problem-based activity itself, and characterized by a progressive trend towards higher levels of L2 critical thinking, with sustained episodes of negotiation and co-construction of meaning. Most notably, the discourse analysis indicated that it was during the consensus-building phase of the problem-based activity that most instances of higher level critical thinking occurred. Moreover, the 3-D representation of learners (as avatars) and space, as well as the immediacy of synchronous chat-based interactions in the VLE had a positive social, motivational, and linguistic impact on this process. These results lend support to the claim that VLEs, with an underlying problem-based and consensus-building component, provide optimal learning opportunities for learners to develop L2 critical thinking and problem solving abilities. Discussion is offered about the benefits of a mixed methods approach to research, as well as about the reliability and validity of Hull &amp; Saxon's (2009) Interaction Analysis model for L2 discourse analysis. Implications for the L2 classroom as well as for future research on L2 negotiation of meaning are also provided.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/nature-l2-negotiation-co-construction-meaning/docview/1030437960/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lyddon, Paul A.",2007,The efficacy of corrective feedback and target form enhancement in promoting acquisition of the <i>à/au/en/aux</i> distinction in L2 French,"Despite popular theoretical arguments against the usefulness of explicit knowledge in the development of linguistic competence (cf. Krashen, 1982; Schwartz, 1993), empirical studies have suggested that comprehensible input alone may be insufficient in fostering target-like L2 production skills (Swain, 1985; Hammerly, 1987; Klein &amp; Perdue, 1997). As such, many SLA researchers (e.g., Long, 1991; 1996; 2007; Spada, 1997; Lyster, 1998; 2001; 2004) now advocate teacher use of negative feedback during communicative activities to promote learner noticing of errors and internalization of correct forms; yet the efficacy of this practice remains questionable as it not only entails the provision of additional input but generally enhances otherwise non-salient linguistic features as well (Leeman, 2003). Moreover, these potentially confounding variables may be particularly problematic with regard to the acquisition of grammatical structures bearing little informational content such as the à/au/en/aux distinction before French toponyms. In a controlled experiment with a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest design, all French 102 students at the University of Arizona in Fall 2006 were randomly assigned to an interactive, computer-based reading lesson featuring either typographically enhanced or unenhanced target forms and one of four types of corrective feedback: meaning-focused, implicit form-focused, simple explicit form-focused, or explicit form-focused with rule explanation. Statistical analyses of the results on both the short-term and long-term linguistic outcome measures showed continuous improvement in target structure accuracy for learners in all treatment conditions. However, there was no significant advantage for any of the investigated feedback types, nor for target form enhancement, and no interaction between these two variables. This study assessed learners' pre-treatment performance on the target structures but not their explicit prior knowledge of them. Thus, it is possible that a fine-tuning of the latter through exposure to comprehensible input reduced the magnitude of the learning effects, especially given the proximity of the target prepositions to their objects. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that neither highlighting nor repeated correction and explanation of these particular grammatical items yields any additional benefit and that instructional efforts may better be focused on maximizing beginning learners' opportunities to process authentic language through meaningful activities.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/efficacy-corrective-feedback-target-form/docview/304893667/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hsieh, Hui-Chen",2007,"Input -based practice, feedback, awareness and L2 development through a computerized task","The importance of practice in learning has been accounted for in cognitive psychology by automatic processing (e.g., Schneider, Dumais &amp; Shiffrin, 1984) or by the skill acquisition theory (e.g., Anderson, 1996). In SLA, although focusing learner attention to form is still a debate (Krashen, 1994; Long &amp; Robinson, 1998), there is currently a movement to define input-based practice as a task feature in which learner attention to form is important for successful performance (e.g., Leow, 2007; Sanz &amp; Morgan-Short, 2005). Empirical support for the input-based practice in L2 development comes from the attentional framework (e.g., Rosa &amp; Leow, 2004) and processing instruction (e.g., Sanz &amp; Morgan-Short, 2004) studies. However, a careful review revealed that feedback had not been teased out from input-based practice, leading to the question of whether it was input-based practice or feedback independently, or a combination of the two that contributed to subsequent L2 performance. Additionally, the construct of attention and awareness has only been operationalized in some research designs (e.g., Rosa &amp; Leow, 2004; Rosa &amp; O'Neill, 1999). This study investigated (1)&#xa0;the effects of input-based practice and type of feedback on college-level L2 beginning learners' development of the Spanish gustar , and (2)&#xa0;the relationship between levels of reported awareness and treatment conditions. Both a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest and a split-block design including oral, written and recognition tests were employed. Online think-aloud protocols were coded and analyzed. The results indicated that input-based practice did not appear to have an overall significant role in learners' L2 development. However, when collapsed with the feedback, input-based practice appears to have promoted a higher level of reported awareness on some linguistic subcomponents. It was the feedback rather than the input-based practice that appeared to facilitate the gustar development by influencing learners' awareness of the relevant linguistic structure although caution is advised given the lack of statistical power due to small sample sizes. Finally, the results also demonstrated that, irrespective of the levels of reported awareness, the participants performed similarly in the oral, written and recognition tests on almost all the linguistic subcomponents of gustar (except for les in recognition).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/input-based-practice-feedback-awareness-l2/docview/304875881/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Takahashi, Nobuaki",2007,"The differential effects of perceptual saliency on recasts in L2 Japanese: Learners' noticing, interpretation, detection, and subsequent oral production","The purpose of the present study is to investigate the differential effects of perceptual saliency added to recasts on learners' attentional allocation and their subsequent utterances. Classroom-based research on recasts, generally understood as implicit negative evidence, finds them to be teachers' most frequently used corrective feedback technique. However, the effectiveness of recasts in triggering immediate uptake or even attention has been questioned whereas a positive effect has been reported in many experimental studies. One source of divergent findings may be the assumption that recasts are a form of implicit feedback, leading researchers to interpret their results as learners not noticing recasts' corrective intent. Equipping recasts with perceptual saliency via input enhancement adds power to recasts, making them explicit enough to trigger noticing and to stimulate reformulation, but not too explicit to impede communication. Given that one possible explanation for the ambiguous results is perceptual saliency of recasts, a new typology of recasts is warranted. This study proposes that recasts can be provided in an explicit manner, suggesting that the notion of explicitness should be considered in a continuum, rather than dichotomous distinction. While engaging in picture description tasks with a native speaker, high-beginner to low-intermediate Japanese-as-a-foreign-language learners received different types of corrective feedback (salient corrective recasts, nonsalient corrective recasts, and negotiation moves) on their erroneous uses of Japanese numeral classifiers. The NS/NNS interactions and learners' comments from stimulated recall protocol were analyzed in terms of learners' attentional allocation and subsequent oral production following the provision of each corrective feedback. The study findings indicated that adding the element of perceptual saliency to the construct of recasts increased the chance of eliciting learners' successful repair and attentional allocation, while perceptually nonsalient recast was least effective. The corrective force of perceptually salient recasts, however, was so robust that it may not effectively trigger learners' metalinguistic awareness. While negotiation moves were beneficial to prompt learners' metalinguistic awareness, learners needed positive evidence (i.e., recasts) when their linguistic knowledge was insufficient for self-correction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/differential-effects-perceptual-saliency-on/docview/304858344/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hayashi, Asako",2000,"Japanese -English bilingual children: A comparative study of attitudes toward bilingualism, language proficiency, and language use of Japanese students in three different bilingual education programs in the United States and in Japan","This study sought to examine the educational supports that foster the bilingual/bicultural development of Japanese-English bilingual students in three different bilingual education programs. It also investigated the students' attitudes toward bilingualism and toward the Japanese language, their actual language use, and their language proficiency in both Japanese and English. Data concerning the students' attitudes, language proficiencies in both Japanese and English, and language use were obtained from observations, interviews, and questionnaires. The participants of this study were 63 Japanese students total in the 4th/5th grade in an English Immersion Program (EIP) in Japan (N = 30), a Japanese Bilingual Program (JBP) in California (N = 25), and in a Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) in Massachusetts (N = 8). The results of the questionnaire asking about the students' attitudes toward bilingualism indicate that the students in all three programs had positive attitudes toward bilingualism. The students' language use in English and Japanese differed significantly among the three programs. The students in the two programs in the US used English much more frequently than did the students in Japan. The students in Japan had very limited opportunities to use English. Consequently the English proficiency of the students in Japan was much lower than that of the students in the US. In contrast, the students in the US had various opportunities to use Japanese in and outside the school. As a result, the Japanese language proficiency of the students in the US progressed even though their Japanese proficiency was lower than that of the students in the EIP in Japan. The results of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients indicate that language use and language proficiency in each language were highly correlated, while attitudes toward bilingualism and toward the Japanese language were not correlated with language use or language proficiency. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the importance of a balanced use of the two languages for bilingual development. Family, school, and community supports are crucial in order to maintain that balanced use of the two languages. In addition, it is important to clarify that family, school, and community should cooperate with each other to create environments in which bilingual children can develop their bilingual proficiency.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/japanese-english-bilingual-children-comparative/docview/304583656/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shibata, Miki",2000,Comparing lexical aspect and narrative discourse in second language learners’ tense -aspect morphology: A cross sectional study of Japanese as a second language,"The current study has attempted to answer the question whether there is an interaction between the Aspect Hypothesis and the Discourse Hypothesis by investigating the use of Japanese tense-aspect morphology by native speakers of English learning Japanese as L2. These two hypotheses were argued for independently in previous studies, but never consolidated to account for the distributional pattern of L2 tense-aspect morphology. The Aspect Hypothesis claims that the L1 and L2 learners initially mark lexical aspect of the verbs with tense-aspect morphology; they tend to associate past with achievement verbs and progressive with activity verbs. On the other hand, according to the Discourse Hypothesis, the learners use the tense-aspect morphology to distinguish grounding; they tend to mark foreground with past more frequently than background. The current research used two methods: a multiple-choice task and a storytelling task. The former task was referred to as Study 1. The use of tense-aspect morphology in the story-telling task was analyzed in terms of lexical aspect, referred to as Study 2 and grounding, referred to as Study 3. Study 1 and Study 2 examined whether the use of tense-aspect morphology is different in obligatory contexts and in narrative discourse. The results of Study 1 supported the Aspect Hypothesis; L2 learners initially associated past inflection with achievement verbs and tended to mark the process encoded in activity and accomplishment verbs with present durative. The results of Study 2 supported the Aspect Hypothesis as regards the association of activity verbs and present durative. However, the frequent marking of past on achievement verbs across the proficiency levels suggest that the textual function of tense-aspect morphology plays a role in narrative discourse. Study 3 argued that the Japanese tense-aspect morphology weakly mark grounding. Finally, I claimed that the Aspect Hypothesis and the Discourse Hypothesis account for the different acquisition stages of the L2 tense-aspect system. There is a time lag among the tense-aspect morphemes in the process of acquisition; past marking functions as the temporal and textual device in narrative discourse at the relatively early stage while present durative remains as the marker of lexical aspect.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comparing-lexical-aspect-narrative-discourse/docview/304584522/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Leeman, Jennifer",2000,"Towards a new classification of input: An empirical study of the effect of recasts, negative evidence, and enhanced salience on L2 development","Two interrelated problems which are of crucial importance in second language acquisition theory and research are: (a)&#xa0;determining which types of linguistic input are utilized in the language acquisition process, and (b)&#xa0;investigating the ways in which participation in communicative interaction can promote language development. Recasts (i.e., targetlike reformulations of nontargetlike utterances) have figured prominently in both lines of research, with recent studies documenting significant advantages for learners exposed to this feedback type. While some researchers have maintained that such findings suggest a role for negative evidence (i.e., information regarding the impossibility of certain utterances in the language being learned), this important issue has not been explored directly, as multiple variables are conflated in recasts. Specifically, recasts not only offer implicit negative evidence, but they also provide positive evidence. Moreover, recasts constitute a discourse structure which may enhance the salience of this positive evidence. To date, there is no empirical evidence regarding how recasts promote language development, nor regarding the isolated effects of negative evidence and enhanced salience of positive evidence in oral input. In order to promote the design of studies which isolate independent features of feedback and input types, this dissertation argues for a new input classification scheme, one in which positive and negative evidence are considered as independent, rather than mutually exclusive, categories. The proposed classification, which includes multiple theoretically-motivated features used to further describe input, is then used in the design of an empirical study in which negative evidence and enhanced salience of positive evidence are isolated. Seventy-three learners of L2 Spanish engaged in individual communicative interaction with the researcher in one of the following conditions: (a)&#xa0;recasts (i.e., negative evidence and enhanced salience of positive evidence), (b)&#xa0;negative evidence, (c)&#xa0;enhanced salience of positive evidence, (d)&#xa0;unenhanced positive evidence (control). The fact that only the recast and enhanced salience groups performed significantly better than the control group on the posttest and delayed posttest suggests that the utility of recasts derives at least in part from enhanced salience of positive evidence, and that the implicit negative evidence they provide is not a crucial factor.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/towards-new-classification-input-empirical-study/docview/304590084/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Adachi, Takanori",2000,Memory of socially obtained information in second language acquisition,"This study investigates whether “socialness,” defined as the existence of a human interactant, increases the memory of newly acquired information about a second language from a microscopic cognitive perspective.

Group one did the session with a human interactant and learned the novel words from him. Group two did the session alone with a tape-recorded voice and learned the words from the voice on tape. Group three did the session alone with a booklet and a dictionary. Posttests were conducted forty-five minutes after the session to assess each subject's memory for: (a)&#xa0;the learning event (i.e., the semantic content of the questions asked), (b)&#xa0;the phonological form of the novel words, and (c)&#xa0;the form-meaning association.

"Davy, Belinda Lee",2000,A cognitive -semantic approach to the acquisition of English prepositions,"This dissertation investigates conceptual transfer as a constraint on the acquisition of English locative prepositions. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lexical-semantic transfer and prototypicality effects adequately account for the specific problems which native Japanese speakers encounter in the acquisition of three English prepositions. The question under investigation is whether interaction of native language spatial schemata, and language-specific semantic and pragmatic strategies associated with two Japanese locatives: de and ni , inhibits the attainment of native-like usage of in, on and at . A preliminary study was conducted which suggested that English and Japanese speakers do not conceive of spatial relationships in the same way. Motivated by the results of the preliminary study, the main study was conducted to test the hypothesis that errors in prepositional usage are symptomatic of two fundamental problems: (1)&#xa0;transfer of an L1 lexical underspecification strategy, which results in overgeneralization of the preposition at, and (2)&#xa0;a failure to construct and implement language-appropriate mental representations of spatial concepts and spatial relations. The study was conducted in two parts. First, a sentence priming task and a grammaticality judgment ranking task were administered to a group of adult Japanese students studying English in the United States. Next, a non-verbal spatial categorization task was administered to both native English-speaking and native-Japanese speaking college students. The validity of a general theory of lexical-semantic transfer and a theory of prototype transfer was confirmed, especially among low-level learners. However, the results suggest that Japanese do not merely transfer lexicon; they also transfer native language semantic and pragmatic strategies. The data also confirmed that English and Japanese speakers often construct very different schematizations of the same real world spatial event. It appears that these culturally-specific viewpoints are also subject to transfer, resulting in similar prepositional usage errors regardless of the level of the learner.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/cognitive-semantic-approach-acquisition-english/docview/304611763/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Saito, Hidetoshi",2000,Persistence and dropout in foreign language learning: Meta-analytic review and prediction and case study of American learners of Japanese,"Objective . The purposes of the current study were fourfold: to summarize a body of literature on foreign/second language (F/SL) persistence and dropout research, to develop a predictive model of student persistence/dropout for Japanese as a foreign language classrooms in American colleges, to apply the model to a class in order to understand the relationship between voluntary classroom participation and persistence/dropout, and finally, to probe student and teacher perspectives on FL persistence and dropout among college students. Method . (1)&#xa0;The F/SL research on persistence and dropout was reviewed narratively and meta-analyzed to identify other strong predictors based on previous findings. (2)&#xa0;An instrument containing affective factor items and background information was developed and presented to 233 college students studying Japanese as a foreign language. The data were analyzed using the Rasch measurement and logistic regression to construct a predictive model. (3)&#xa0;A classroom with 10 students was observed for 3 months and voluntary participation was coded, and the relationship between voluntary participation and persistence/dropout was examined. (4)&#xa0;Students and teachers were interviewed to gain further insight into the phenomenon of persistence and dropout in FL study. Results . The results of the literature review showed consistent evidence that reported the predictive power of motivation/attitude and achievement. A model for predicting student persistence/dropout was constructed based on motivation and several other variables. The model achieved 78% correct prediction of student persistence/dropout, with motivation and schedule conflicts being significant predictors. The predictive probabilities for 9 students generated from this model, however, were found to have no association with voluntary FL classroom participation. A one-quarter observation (10 weeks) and interviews with students suggested that a simple dichotomy in the concept of persistence/dropout may be inappropriate. Conclusions . Student persistence/dropout in FL study is predictable with a certain degree of accuracy. Classroom participation may not have a strong relationship with persistence/dropout, however.

"Schau, Kaori Deguchi",2000,The effects of first language orthographic variation on second language Japanese word recognition,"The present study investigated whether learners of Japanese with different L1 orthographic backgrounds differ from each other in processing Japanese words. Based on previous findings that visual information processing in L1 varies to some extent depending on the type of orthography, it was presumed that L1 orthographic variation might have effects on L2 word processing. In the present study, English-, Chinese-, and Korean-speaking learners of Japanese performed a lexical decision task and a sentence judgment task. The target words were basic verbs written either in sound-based Hiragana letters only or in a combination of a meaning-based Kanji character and Hiragana letters. A statistical analysis indicated that Chinese-speaking learners were faster than English- and Korean-speaking learners in both orthographic conditions. There was no significant difference between English- and Korean-speaking learners. Subjects' comments in a questionnaire about how they processed Hiragana and Kanji revealed considerable individual differences in terms of preference for either orthography. These results are discussed in terms of reliance on either phonological information or visual/orthographic information in the process of L2 Japanese word recognition.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-first-language-orthographic-variation-on/docview/304616237/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Dykman, Elizabeth",2000,Exploring second language acquisition and acculturation through autobiographical texts: A qualitative study of second language learners/authors,"This qualitative study examined early stages of second language (L2) learning and acculturation experiences through autobiographical texts (as well as interviews conducted with its authors), such as Eva Hoffman's Lost in Translation , Richard Rodriguez' Hunger of Memory , and Natasha Lvovich's The Multilingual Self , and juxtaposed them against relevant second language acquisition theories and constructs. The research has shown that despite the authors/learners' initial culture shock they became successful language learners, and their published books attest to that. The study also revealed that the participants' share in common their negative reactions to the sounds of English, an interesting affective factor, which has not been previously identified in L2 literature. Moreover, the participants share a remarkable bond with their respective families, and their concern for their family's well being appears to be one of the dominating themes in their lives. Although the authors/learners' experiences appear to coincide in a number of ways, I have also found instances, which clearly set them apart. Using Rodriguez, Hoffman and Lvovich's membership in a number of linguistic and cultural affiliations as an example, we have ample evidence to suggest that language learners are able to maintain more than one language and culture, without necessarily giving up one to acquire the other. This outcome clearly contradicts the position advocated by uni-linear socio-cultural models, which emphasize the inability of minority learners to partake simultaneously in multiple sociolinguistic units.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-second-language-acquisition/docview/304617631/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Collins, Laura",2000,Marking time: The acquisition of tense and grammatical aspect by French -speaking learners of English,"The two cross-sectional studies reported on here ( N = 70; N = 91) were designed to explore the relative influences of lexical asp aspect and first language (L1) knowledge on the second language (L2) acquisition of verb morphology. The participants were adult French-speaking learners of English who represented a wide range of proficiency in their knowledge of simple past. The analyses examined the degree to which the learners' appropriate and inappropriate use of tense/aspect markers in past contexts supported the predictions of the aspect hypothesis (Andersen and Shirai, 1994; Bardovi-Harlig, 1994), and the degree to which it showed influence from French, their (L1). The findings showed that both factors played a role. French-speaking learners were significantly more successful in using past morphology with telics (accomplishments and achievements) and had the most difficulty with statives. Lexical aspect also appeared to influence the forms that competed for simple past: there was greater use of progressive with activities, and simple present with statives. These findings are consistent with the predictions of the aspect hypothesis, and partially consistent with previous research with L2 learners of English from other L1 backgrounds. Francophones also showed evidence of L1 influence in their inappropriate use of perfect (a French-influenced form) with telics, a finding that has not been reported in previous research. The interpretation of the findings takes into account individual variation and developmental constraints. The thesis concludes with some discussion of the potential implications of the findings for second language pedagogy.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/marking-time-acquisition-tense-grammatical-aspect/docview/304633441/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hertel, Tammy Jandrey",2000,The second language acquisition of Spanish word order: Lexical and discourse factors,"The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the acquisition of Spanish word order by native English speakers. Specifically, I investigate the development and attainment of sensitivity to the distinct interpretations of subject-verb (SV) versus verb-subject (VS) order, as determined by lexical class and discourse structure. There are two classes of intransitive verbs, unaccusatives and unergatives, whose distinct lexical representations are reflected in different word order preferences in Spanish. While the discourse neutral order for unaccusatives is VS, that of unergatives is SV. When the subject is the focus of a sentence, VS order is elicited for both verb classes. Spanish uses syntactic means to enable focused elements to receive the main sentential stress at the end of a sentence, while English maintains SV order and uses prosody to mark focus. Given this difference between English and Spanish, the lexical projection problem it presents, and the subtle and complex nature of the input, this study investigates the extent to which learners of varying levels of second language proficiency are able to acquire Spanish word order. A native speaker control group and learners of four proficiency levels participated in this study. Participants completed two tasks: a written production task and an aural judgement task. Results from both tasks indicate that beginning learners transferred English SV order for all structures. For the aural task they preferred sentence-internal stress with SV order over the target VS order with sentence-final stress. Intermediate learners showed a gradual increase in the production of and preference for inversion with unaccusatives and focused subjects, although their data was also characterized by indeterminacy and variability. Advanced learners demonstrated a native-like sensitivity to the word order effects of unaccusativity and discourse factors, but they tended to overgeneralize inversion with unergatives in neutral discourse contexts. The difficulties that learners experience with these aspects of Spanish word order can be attributed to the ambiguous and subtle nature of the L2 input. Both the developmental path of acquisition and the residual indeterminacy found in advanced learners' grammars are consistent with the lexical view of parametric change that follows from the Minimalist Program.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-spanish-word-order/docview/304634379/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Matsui, Shiro",2000,The relevance of the native language in foreign language acquisition: The critical period hypothesis for foreign language pronunciation,"This study assessed how learners' first language (L1) and their learning experience interact in acquiring second language (L2) phonology if exposure to the target language (TL) starts post-pubertally. According to the Critical Period Hypothesis, it is impossible to acquire native fluency in a language after puberty. The Speech Learning Model posits that, unlike the Contrastive Analysis notion (“the more different L1 and L2 are, the more difficult”), a partial similarity of L2 to L1 can be detrimental. Lengthy exposure to L2 enables learners to establish categories for “new” sounds, whereas equivalent classification, or replacement of L2 features with neighboring L1 sounds, blocks the learners' access to “similar but not identical” sounds. It was hypothesized that “similar” sounds would be difficult, regardless of learners' developmental stages, but that the experienced subjects, having established categories, would produce and perceive “new” sounds authentically. Eighty-two nonnative speakers whose L1 was English, Chinese, or Korean, and eight native speakers of Japanese, participated in the experiments. In Experiment 1, global foreign accent was evaluated by a sentence reading task. In Experiments 2 and 3, subjects demonstrated their ability to produce and perceive “new” and “similar but not identical” sounds. There was not a single non-native subject whose global foreign accent was judged as native-like; however, several subjects produced and perceived isolated words within the native range. For all of the experiments, the L1 effect was found to exist. These findings challenge the view that the critical period for L2 is an all-or-nothing phenomenon biologically constrained in any language learning situation. Adult learners' degree of performance in producing and perceiving L2 sounds is highly affected by the relative distance between L1 and L2.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/relevance-native-language-foreign-acquisition/docview/304636465/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Thomson, Gregory Edward",2000,Second language acquisition and comprehension mechanisms: The problem of Russian inflectional morphology,"Acquiring grammatical form is typically considered central to second language acquisition (SLA), and assumed to involve the development of an internal grammar, i.e., a mental apparatus that characterizes the form of sentences in the second language (L2). An alternative assumed here is to view linguistic forms as processing triggers and SLA as learning to detect and react to such triggers (and then to produce comparable ones). Inflectional cue systems are inherently complex, combining lexical cues and grammatical cues in phonological words. They are complex in their formal nature, in the sets of processes that they trigger, and in the relationships between the two. Thus, it should not be surprising that L2 inflection is often not readily acquired. This dissertation first sketches a broad picture of language processing, next explores the nature of inflectional morphology, and then proceeds to an experimental investigation into whether various categories of inflectional morphology are active or inert in the comprehension systems of ninety-one adult learners of Russian as a second language, representing two developmental levels (along with twenty-five native Russian control participants). Sensitivity to inflectional errors (and by implication, to particular features of inflectional form) was investigated under three conditions: (1)&#xa0;meaning-oriented listening; (2)&#xa0;form-oriented listening; (3)&#xa0;free examination of printed sentence. Evidence emerges that systematic acquisition of inflectional morphology does take place in learners of L2 Russian. However, the developmental process would appear to be so protracted that complete acquisition may be a rarity. Explicit metalinguistic knowledge of L2 grammar may allow some learners to simulate many features of nativelike production when the relevant strictly linguistic developments may still be years away. Implications are discussed in relation to various SLA models and research approaches.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-comprehension/docview/304646102/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hirakawa, Makiko",2000,Unaccusativity in second language Japanese and English,"This thesis investigates L2 acquisition of intransitive verb constructions in Japanese and English. Within the Generative framework, the Unaccusative Hypothesis has been proposed, which divides intransitive verbs into two syntactically distinct classes: unergatives and unaccusatives (Burzio 1986). The sole argument of unergative verbs is an Agent generated in subject position, whereas that of unaccusative verbs is a Theme or Patient base-generated in object position. While the unaccusative/unergative distinction at the level of Deep (D)-Structure holds universally, as derived by a universal principle called the Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (UTAH, Baker 1988), languages differ as to where the underlying object of unaccusatives may be positioned at the level of Surface (S)-structure. In the case of English, it surfaces in the subject position where it receives Nominative Case. In the case of Japanese, on the other hand, it has been argued that the argument of unaccusative verbs remains in its base-generated object position and that Nominative Case is assigned within the Verb Phrase. Experimental studies are conducted to examine learners' knowledge of unaccusativity at the two levels, i.e. D-Structure and S-Structure. It is hypothesized that learners will show sensitivity to unaccusativity at D-Structure, but that they may not acquire the correct representation of unaccusativity in the L2 at S-Structure, at least in an earlier stage. The first two studies present the L2 acquisition of English by Japanese speakers. The next two studies are concerned with the L2 acquisition of Japanese by English speakers. Overall, results of the four studies confirm the hypotheses, and L2 learners appear to have problems where the L1 manifests a different representation from the L2. Nevertheless, it is observed that L2 learners behavior is not random even when difficulty arises, in that the L2 learners are often consistent with one class of verbs, but not with the other. Thus, it is suggested that the L2 acquisition of intransitive verb constructions is constrained by universal principles, such as the Unaccusative Hypothesis and the UTAH.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/unaccusativity-second-language-japanese-english/docview/304663562/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Haneda, Mari",2000,Negotiating meaning in writing conferences: An investigation of a university Japanese-as-a-foreign language class,"Conceived within the frameworks of cultural-historical activity theory, systemic functional linguistics, and situated literacy, this study investigates the form and function of writing conferences in a university foreign-language class, focusing on the relationship among the teacher-student discourse in conferences, students' subsequent text revisions, and other factors affecting their modes of engagement with the writing activity. The study involved 9 students who, over the course of 1 semester, composed texts on 3 different topics as part of classroom activities. Then in conferences with the teacher, they discussed their first drafts, produced second drafts, and, in interviews, reflected on the processes involved. The main sources of data consisted of audio-recordings of the conferences, the students' written products, both first and final drafts, audio-recordings of 3 retrospective interviews, and a questionnaire concerning their ethnolinguistic background. The triangulated sources of data were analyzed through the combined use of quantitative and qualitative methods. Overall, the analyses pointed to the positive effects of the tripartite writing activity. The students as a whole utilized the majority of specific pointers offered during the conferences to revise their first drafts. They also reported the metalinguistic and metacognitive value to them of engaging in the process. Quantitative analyses of the conference discourse and of the relationship between the discourse and the students' revisions showed that the manner in which the students engaged in the writing-related activities was strongly influenced by the revision goals they set themselves, the topics selected for discussion in the conferences, and their target language proficiency. Additionally, qualitative analyses of 5 mini-case studies revealed that, in accounting for the students' differential performance, other factors, which appeared to cut across the proficiency differences, interacted with their target language proficiency in an intricate yet dynamic way. The study suggests the importance of: (a)&#xa0;exploring teacher-student interaction in terms of discourse theory; (b)&#xa0;examining overall patterns of intertextual relationships between students' text revisions and talk around their texts; and (c)&#xa0;taking account of the multiple contexts that shape and are shaped by the writing activity. Methodological and pedagogical implications are also discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/negotiating-meaning-writing-conferences/docview/304665158/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Fender, Michael John",2001,English (ESL) word recognition and word integration skills of Arab and Japanese ESL students,"This study examined the word recognition and word integration skills of Japanese and Arab ESL speakers who were enrolled in intermediate and advanced level courses in two pre-academic ESL program. The purpose for this study was to identify and examine the different types of reading problems that Japanese and Arab ESL students have with on-line, ESL reading skills at the word and sentence level. A lexical decision task was used to examine the word recognition skills of the Japanese and Arab ESL participants. A group of Japanese ESL participants (n = 20) exhibited significantly faster word recognition skills than a proficiency matched group of Arab ESL participants (n = 19). The Japanese ESL group was also more accurate in judging whether stimulus items were English words or non-words, though both groups were comparable in recognizing and judging English words when timed out responses were considered. In contrast, the Japanese and Arab ESL groups read words in a word-by-word, subject-controlled sentence reading task at the same speed. However, the Arab ESL group was significantly more accurate than the Japanese ESL group in integrating words into phrase and clause units and comprehending them. These results indicate that Japanese and Arab ESL students have distinctly different word-level problems, which implicate different ESL learning needs for each group in developing lower-level reading skills necessary for ESL reading proficiency.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/english-esl-word-recognition-integration-skills/docview/250025978/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kono, Nariyo",2001,Language orientations: Case study of a Japanese -as -a -foreign -language classroom,"The purpose of this study is to examine the theories of orientations in the context of a Japanese-as-a-foreign-language (JFL) classroom in the Northwest of the United States. Using a Grounded Theory methodology, this study includes data from card-sorting activities, teacher and student interviews, classroom observations, and scenario studies. The perspectives of language planning—theories of orientations—bring socio-political aspects to the foreign language classroom context, and help to describe the participants’ voices, hopes and determinations toward learning Japanese in a foreign language classroom setting. The existing theories of orientations and the abstraction of the data results are merged into a new taxonomy. The notion of Grounded Theory—an interplay of data and theories—is a central perspective throughout the study. The JFL program in the Northwest reflects many aspects of the language-as-resource orientation. Most of the participants’ voices and hopes are explicitly included in the program and in some standards on foreign language education. However, heritage language and identity issues are not explicitly discussed in this program. The research suggests that this program consider this aspect and develop an appropriate methodology for this population. In addition, a new descriptive orientation taxonomy is suggested in the coding process: Language as means of communication, Language as linguistic means, and Language as a mediator of culture (with two different emphases: First language and culture; and Any language and culture). The research findings and interpretations were negotiated with the participants in order to assure their appropriateness, and the study includes two-year data from various interviews, ranging from a pilot study to final interviews. Final interviews were conducted in addition to the main study in order to assure the results and my interpretations of interview quotations. This study contributes to research methodology itself by incorporating various research tools including descriptive statistics and traditional qualitative methods. As an exploration of this topic, this study presents important implications to foreign language education and pedagogy, and to theory development in language planning and policy.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/language-orientations-case-study-japanese-as/docview/304684263/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kim, Duk-Young",2001,A descriptive analysis of Korean and English apologies with implications for interlanguage pragmatics,"The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate Korean baseline data on apologies as well as interlanguage apologies of Koreans in the EFL (English as a Foreign Language) environment. In particular, Korean and EFL speakers' apology behaviors are analyzed in terms of different social variables with particular attention to pragmatic transfer of first language norms. In general, many Korean EFL speakers mistakenly transfer their apology strategies to English, believing that these strategies are the same for both languages. Therefore, this study compares the findings of both Korean and interlanguage apologies in light of transfer phenomena. A variety of data collection methods were used: role-playing, ethnographic observation and the scripts of Korean TV dramas. The Korean EFL participants are comprised of 60 undergraduate students who are majoring in English at a university in Korea. The research questions of this dissertation are as follows: (1)&#xa0;How, and to what extent, do Korean students of English transfer their first language norms of apologizing when using English as a foreign language? (2)&#xa0;How, and to what extent, do the social factors (gender, age, social status and social distance) affect the choices of Koreans when speaking English? (3)&#xa0;How do apology strategies differ between what is appropriate in Korean L1 and English as a foreign language? (4)&#xa0;How do Korean speakers perform and react to the speech act of apology according to the influence of social factors in spontaneous situations? The findings of this study showed the influence of social factors: social distance, social status, age, gender and severity of offense. In regards to the “social status” factor, EFL speakers transferred their L1 pragmatic norms into English when using the “alerter” strategy. With respect to the “age” factor, EFL speakers in the Equal-age group showed the transfer phenomenon from their native pragmatic norms to English. Finally, concerning the “gender” factor, EFL speakers in the male-female group also transferred L1 pragmatic norms by using a higher proportion of the “repetition” strategy than with the remaining groups. This study has important pedagogical implications for non-native speakers receiving overt instruction on speech acts in English as a foreign language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/descriptive-analysis-korean-english-apologies/docview/304693080/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tokuda, Miho",2001,L2 learners' perceptions of politeness in Japanese: The evaluations on non-native speaker in L2 Japanese,"The present study assesses pragmalinguistic knowledge of learners of Japanese as a second/foreign language in terms of linguistic politeness in non-native speaker requests in Japanese. Some dimensions of the participants' evaluations were taken into consideration and the learners' evaluations were compared with native speakers'. Significant differences were found in the evaluations between the learners and the native speakers. Most of those differences depended on speech style; speech style was a significant factor in the evaluations as well. The intermediate learners perceived little difference in the degree of politeness in the stimuli, whereas the advanced learners' evaluations showed trends similar to those of the native speakers'. Appropriate use of honorifics, formal forms, donative auxiliary verbs, and formulaic expressions positively influenced the evaluations. However, the inappropriate use of honorifics and informal style, and disfluency caused mainly by hesitation markers had mixed effects on the evaluations. In some cases, the learners were negatively influenced, but the native speakers were positively influenced. In other cases, reversed results were obtained. To further the understanding of the learners' pragmatic knowledge, a sociopragmatic assessment was conducted as well. Significant differences were found among participant groups in their evaluations of a speaker's right to make requests and a hearer's obligation to comply with the requests. However, those differences depended on the request type. In addition, significant correlations were found between the participants' pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic assessments, which indicates a relationship between the evaluations of linguistic politeness and degree of imposition of the requests.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-learners-perceptions-politeness-japanese/docview/304698496/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Abe, Megumi",2001,L2 writers' perspectives on writing in the L2 context: Six case studies of Japanese students,"Most of the existing research on L2 writing to date makes comparisons between L1 and L2 or between NSs and NNSs. There is relatively little research to date, that views L2 learners as L2 users (writers) who have multi-competent knowledge and explores L2 writers' perspectives on good writing in the L2 context. The overall purpose of this study is twofold. The first purpose is to explore the international Japanese undergraduate and graduate students' perspectives on good writing and examine the factors that affect L2 writers' perspectives on good writing in the L2 context from three different contexts: the L1 context; the L2 context; and the future context. This study also explores whether these L2 writers' perspectives on writing change during their first academic year in the U.S. The second purpose is to examine what is useful for L2 writers from their own perspective and meet the needs of L2 writers with regard to their own goals and experiences as L2 writers. This research was a longitudinal case study of six Japanese students during their first academic year in the U.S. Data consist of interviews, observations, examination of participants' writing, and discussions about model writing the participants considered “good writing.” The data revealed individual differences among the L2 writers regarding how much they struggled with adjusting to L2 and how much their L1 perspectives transferred to their L2 writing and changed. Furthermore, L2 writers' confidence in L1 writing transferred directly to their confidence in L2 writing at the beginning: the participants with more writing experiences in L1 perceived themselves as better writers and had more confidence in L1 writing than those with less L1 writing experience. However, their confidence level seemed to have changed later in the year. The findings suggest educators need to increase their awareness that L2 writers bring their perspectives on writing from the L1 context and that these perspectives are tentative because L2 writers acquire mixed perspectives from the L1, L2, and future contexts, thus becoming multi-competent.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-writers-perspectives-on-writing-context-six/docview/304717875/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

This research examines such key issues as how literacy is affected by the use of CMC, how computers can be used to teach collaboratively and the role of CMC in developing written argument. A shift from print-based literacy to interactive electronic-based literacy has the potential to transform the nature of both literacy and pedagogy. This project employs a Socio-cultural and Discourse Analysis perspective and investigates the use of CMC in post-graduate education and its effect on academic literacy.

"Lopez Ortega, Nuria Rocio",2002,The development of discourse competence in study abroad learners: A study of subject expression in Spanish as a second language,"The study examines the Spanish subjects in discourse and across time for intermediate to advanced learners of Spanish during four and a half months of a study abroad experience. The study focuses on occurrence of NP subjects, pronominal subjects and null subjects in discourse across time (interviews) in four intermediate to advanced L2 Spanish learners. Syntactic, semantic and discursive variables are examined in the quantitative analysis of the oral data. Quantitative analysis of the data according to subject condition and time reveals a strong effect for individual variation, but not a significant effect of time; some of the mentioned variables affect presence or absence of subjects in discourse and some have an over-time effect on one or all of the subject conditions. While the quantitative results of the data do not present conclusive effects on the development of acquisition of subjects, a qualitative analysis of the conversations shows how discourse conditions beyond the traditional aspects of contrast, emphasis and disambiguation affect the presence or absence of subjects. Some of these discursive aspects are speaker's identity and topic involvement, semantic features of the referents, interlinguistic narrative structures, type of verb, conjunctions and adverbials. Detailed analysis of the discourse shows that each learner develops in their use of subjects over time, and allow us to conclude that, (1)&#xa0;there are some common tendencies according to proficiency stages; (2)&#xa0;L2 discourse patterns successfully mark contrast, emphasis or disambiguation, thus creating cohesion in the text; and (3)&#xa0;despite individual variation and the difficulty to establish a common tendency towards the native norm, the four learners become more proficient on their expression of Spanish subjects after a their study-abroad experience.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-discourse-competence-study-abroad/docview/251797058/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kawate-Mierzejewska, Megumi",2002,Refusal sequences in conversational discourse,"This study investigated sequences of refusal realization strategies between Japanese speakers speaking Japanese (JJs) and North American English speaker speaking Japanese (AJs) in conversational discourse focusing on the differences and similarities between native speakers (NSs) and nonnative speakers (NNSs) as well as those between males and females. I also investigated to what extent and in what way different initiation types affected the differences and similarities of refusal sequences in conversational discourse between the JJs and AJs. Ten male JJs, ten female JJs, ten male AJs, and ten female AJs participated in this study in addition to coders and a requester. Forty separate telephone conversations with two different groups of participants were taped, one with JJ-JJ interactions, and the other with JJ-AJ interactions. In analyzing the recorded data, each interaction was first transcribed, and then each transcribed conversation was divided into stages on the basis of the requester's initiation. Then request-refusal interactions were carefully examined and the requester's initiations were coded. This was followed by the coding of refusal realization strategies used at each stage. Finally, semantic formulas used for first and final responses in refusal sequences, patterns of relationship between the first and final responses, patterns of request-refusal interactions, and patterns of refusal sequences were identified and examined. The results indicate that (a)&#xa0;the AJs used a wider variety of refusal realization strategies in their first responses to a request than did the JJs; (b)&#xa0;the JJs and AJs all used different varieties of refusal realization strategies in their final responses which made the requester stop negotiating; (c)&#xa0;the AJs employed twice as many patterns as did the JJs in the relationship between the first and final responses of refusal sequential organizations; (d)&#xa0;refusal sequential organizations were independent of different types of re-initiations; (e)&#xa0;the AJs employed a wider variety of refusal sequential organizations than did the JJs in conversational discourse; and (f)&#xa0;responses by males were often different from those of females regardless of first language in their entire sequences of refusal realization strategies. To conclude, the study has raised many important issues in investigating refusal interactions.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/refusal-sequences-conversational-discourse/docview/275872042/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Felix-Brasdefer, Julio Cesar",2002,"Refusals in Spanish and English: A cross -cultural study of politeness strategies among speakers of Mexican Spanish, American English, and American learners of Spanish as a foreign language","This study investigates the speech act performance of native speakers of Mexican Spanish (SPN-SPN), native speakers of American English (ENG-ENG), and advanced American learners of Spanish as a Foreign Language (ENG-SPN) in refusals in six different situations (two invitations, two requests, and two suggestions) of equal and higher status (N = 60 [20 male subjects per group]) using enhanced role plays and retrospective verbal reports (Cohen 1998; Ericsson &amp; Simon 1993). Variables controlled were: gender, age, L2 Spanish dialect, experience abroad, and proficiency level. Transcripts from the 360 role plays were classified according to refusal strategies including direct and indirect refusals, and adjuncts to refusals. As refusals are complex speech acts which often entail negotiation, the data were examined as refusal sequences throughout the refusal interaction encompassing pre-refusals, head acts, and post-refusals. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. Results showed that learners differed from the SPN-SPN group in the frequency, content, and perceptions of refusal strategies. Significant differences occurred in the use of flat ‘ no ,’ mitigated refusal, alternative, gratitude/appreciation , and agreement . Six strategies not observed in previous studies were identified. Contextual factors, such as the level of social status, social distance, and situation, influenced the number and selection of strategies. Among the learners, negative pragmatic transfer was found in the frequency, content, and social perceptions of refusal strategies. In addition, a lack of sufficient grammatical knowledge prevented learners from refusing appropriately. Lexical and syntactic devices to mitigate the refusal were infrequent in the ENG-SPN group. The difficulty of performing the speech act increased in situations of higher status. Rather than proficiency level, length of stay in the target culture appeared to be a better predictor of pragmatic ability. Retrospective verbal reports were instrumental in providing insights into learners' perceptions of refusals, their linguistic and sociocultural knowledge, and the language of thought preferred to perform the speech act. The concept of ‘face’ is re-examined and it is suggested that group face (Nwoye 1992) applies to the Mexican culture, while individual face better describes the American society. Issues in research methodology and pedagogical implications for the L2 classroom are discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/refusals-spanish-english-cross-cultural-study/docview/276533280/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Currah, Satomi",2002,Processing Japanese adnominal structures: An empirical study of native and non-native speakers' strategies,"In Japanese, noun phrases (NP) can be modified by preceding clauses (CL). In this study, four types of noun modifying constructions (NMC) are recognized. In the Regular Relative (RR), the NP is a part of the proposition that the CL expresses. In the Gapless Relative (GR), the NP is a part of the proposition of which an unexpressed verb is also a part. In the Complement (COMP), the NP is the name of what the CL denotes. In the Clause and Noun Host Type (CN), the NP is a name of a participant in the proposition expressed by the CL. Compared to English, the Japanese RR is equivalent to a relative clause and the COMP to a complement with a nominal head. A markedness relation, in terms of the resources required for processing, is proposed to characterize the distinction among the four types. In the absence of prior empirical studies investigating how speakers of Japanese comprehend NMCs, a series of experiments was designed to determine what kinds of cues are used by Japanese native speakers and English speaking learners of Japanese to comprehend NMCs. The experiments involved 23 Japanese native speakers and 11 English Japanese as a second language learners (English JSLs) who were given sets of sentences containing the four types of NMC and were asked to rate them in terms of naturalness and ease of understanding. In addition, English JSLs did a translation task under a time constraint, and finally, both groups carried out a task in which reading speed and probe recognition times were measured. Native speakers use different processing resource domains as a cue, making distinction among the four types as follows: GR involves the largest resource domain and COMP the least, while CN and RR make intermediate demands on processing resources. The same cue is used by English JSLs; additional cues used by English JSLs are the elements involved in forming cohesion between the CL and the NP, such as a gap, semantics of the NP, the NP's status in the proposition, and the number of roles the NP plays. Transfer also plays a role.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-japanese-adnominal-structures/docview/305506179/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Morita, Kyoko",2002,Negotiating identity politics: Exploring Brazilian children's experiences at a Japanese school,"Since the early 1990s, more and more Brazilians of Japanese descent have migrated back to Japan and settled in Japanese local communities. As they send their children to Japanese public schools, these children sometimes have difficulty adjusting both academically and socially. This dissertation presents case studies of three Japanese-Brazilian students enrolled in a Japanese elementary school. I describe various dimensions of their experiences in school, and I follow their crosscultural adjustment over time. Data come from ethnographic research conducted during three four-month cycles, in the school and surrounding community. Analysis of these data indicates that two key factors influenced these students' acculturation in the Japanese school: (1)&#xa0; interpersonal identity , in which the students constructed positive senses of themselves as they participated in social groups and built relationships with other co-members; and (2)&#xa0; intra-minority politics , in which the students constructed positive senses of themselves by either associating themselves with or differentiating themselves from students who were also different from the mainstream. The analysis shows how the three students actively took control of their identities and struggled to create positive senses of themselves. Because of the agency displayed by the students, these data show the need for theories that do not rely solely on mismatches between minority and majority students' ways of behaving. These students managed to integrate socially and advance academically, by creatively using the skills and identity-resources available to them, thus showing how the supposedly homogenous and homogenizing Japanese educational system can in fact serve ethnic-minority children.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/negotiating-identity-politics-exploring-brazilian/docview/305508061/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ueyama, Motoko",2000,Prosodic transfer: An acoustic study of L2 English vs. L2 Japanese,"The effect of L1 characteristics on L2 speech has been investigated extensively at the segmental level. This dissertation investigates how L1 prosodic features affect L2 prosodic patterns in the production of the adult L2 speaker (i.e., prosodic transfer ). Four speech types were analyzed: (1)&#xa0;L2 English produced by L1 Japanese speakers; (2)&#xa0;L2 Japanese produced by L1 English speakers; (3)&#xa0;L1 English; (4)&#xa0;L1 Japanese. This comparison is interesting, since Japanese and English are typologically very different in terms of their prosodic properties: e.g., English has stress accents, while Japanese has pitch accents; Japanese has a phonemic length contrast, while English does not; English is a stress-timed language, while Japanese is a mora-timed language. Seven phonetic experiments were conducted to investigate three prosodic phenomena: (1)&#xa0;the contrast between lexically accented and unaccented vowels (Experiments 1–3); (2)&#xa0;the contrast between English tense vs. lax vowels and between Japanese short vs. long vowels (Experiments 4 and 5); (3)&#xa0;the temporal organization across syllables (Experiments 6 and 7). Prosody is phonetically realized by multiple acoustic correlates, which differ from language to language. In the analysis of the collected data, various correlates relevant to each of the three prosodic phenomena were analyzed, taking both phonological and phonetic aspects into account. Additionally, a survey testing phonological awareness of L2 syllable structure was conducted. The results of the survey were analyzed together with the results of the phonetic experiments. The results supported the following generalizations: first, the transfer patterns of L1 prosodic features in L2 prosody can vary greatly from correlate to correlate. Second, different transfer patterns in the learner's production can be explained by a difference between L1 and L2 in terms of the phonological status of a relevant prosodic feature. Third, there is a systematic interaction between the prosodic and segmental levels in the transfer of L1 features in L2 speech development. Finally, an L2 speaker's prosodic system does not necessarily develop in a parallel manner for different dimensions of prosody.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/prosodic-transfer-acoustic-study-l2-english-vs/docview/304582382/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Biggers, Robert Glen",2002,Second language grammatical competency through the L(1) cultural prescription: A descriptive approach to the DCB model,"The study examines the phenomenology of native culture in second language acquisition through a study specific model. The DCB model theorizes that a beginning, nonnative language learner will be more motivated and more apt to learn a second language when matched with a culturally synonymous, more linguistically proficient, second language peer. The study examined L2 instruction in two different groupings—dyadic, instructor and student cultural congruent and whole group, instructor and student non-culturally congruent. Intent was to determine the feasibility of native cultural matching in facilitating grammatical understanding by examining the affective and pragmatic components. The study contrived artificially congruent and non-congruent cultural settings for observation. Data was collected via triangularity using discourse analysis, written assessment, and Thurstone-type survey instrumentation. Each of the two instructional motifs was presented once for each of the three lessons for a total of six treatments. Subjects were all Hispanic attendees at a Baptist mission in Batesville, Mississippi. The study considered that pragmatic judgment of the conceptual-cultural connection comes through the dynamics of speech and written discourse depicted through univariate statistics. The findings and implications generated by the study's five questions would assume to support a qualitative basis for the DCB model.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-grammatical-competency-through-l/docview/305517114/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Iwasaki, Noriko",2000,Speaking Japanese: L1 and L2 grammatical encoding of case particles and adjectives/adjectival nouns,"The ultimate objective of this project was to link psycholinguistic theories of sentence production to the study of L2 acquisition. To achieve this goal, two steps were taken: first, some of the specifics of the grammatical encoding processes that occur during L1 Japanese sentence production were investigated; second, L2 Japanese learners’ sentence production processes were examined. Because any L2 data that we can observe is necessarily the product of both speakers’ underlying knowledge and their capacity to process a language, it is important to investigate language processes in order to fully understand L2 development. I studied two processes of both L1 and L2 speakers: (1)&#xa0;lexical retrieval processes for adjectives and adjectival nouns (both of which roughly correspond to English adjectives, but differ from each other in their morphosyntax), by using tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) experiments; and (2)&#xa0;case particle selection, by examining speech errors (e.g., L1 and L2 errors that occurred during picture description experiments, in addition to naturally occurring L1 errors). L2 Japanese speakers also participated in several other tasks, including tasks that assessed their knowledge of adjectives/adjectival nouns and case particles. It was found that both L1 and L2 speakers of Japanese had access to the word category information of a target adjective or adjectival noun during TOT states. Also, L2 learners’ error patterns in a picture description task roughly matched their knowledge of the morphosyntax of adjectives and adjectival nouns. Thus, most of the morphosyntactic errors of adjectives and adjectival nouns were attributed to L2 learners’ knowledge, rather than their lexical retrieval processes or processing strategies. However, L2 speakers’ self-repairs and verbal reports indicated that some morphosyntactic errors occurred due to processing factors. The examination of L1 case particle errors indicated that L1 speakers may use certain sentence processing strategies, two of which involve use of the nominative marker ga (as default), and the selection of a prototypical case particle for a semantic role of an NP. L2 speech errors revealed that L2 Japanese speakers employ word order based processing strategies during sentence production, and that they may also use prototypical particles for NPs having given semantic roles.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/speaking-japanese-l1-l2-grammatical-encoding-case/docview/304579572/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nassajizavareh, Hossein",1998,A component skills approach to adult ESL reading: Evidence from native speakers of Farsi,"The role of basic language processing components, in general, and that of lower-level phonological and orthographic processing skills, in particular, is not well understood in second language reading. Most research in second and foreign language (L2) reading has followed top-down models, focusing almost exclusively on the role of higher-level processes such as background knowledge and the knowledge of syntactic and semantic structures in processing text. Therefore, the lower-level dimensions of text, particularly phonological and orthographic processes, have not received attention relative to more top-down processes. The present study addressed this gap in current knowledge by investigating basic language processing skills in adult English as a second language (ESL) readers who were native speakers of Farsi. Measures of lower-level phonological and orthographic processing skills in conjunction with higher-level syntactic and semantic processing skills were used while controlling for aspects of cognitive ability relevant to reading such as working memory and speed of lexical access. Participants were 60 advanced ESL readers (all adult native speakers of Farsi residing in Canada). Three measures of reading were criterion variables: reading comprehension, silent reading rate, and the ability to recognize individual words out of context. Data were analyzed using correlations and hierarchical multiple regressions. Correlational analyses revealed that both speed and accuracy on second language phonological, orthographic, syntactic, and semantic measures correlated significantly with each other and with various indices of ESL reading proficiency. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that efficiency in phonological and orthographic processing contributed to the prediction of individual differences on the reading measures. In particular, efficiency in orthographic processing contributed unique variance to the reading measures over and above the variance contributed by higher level syntactic and semantic skills. The results challenge the common assumption in L2 that the availability of higher-level processes in L2 reading comprehension reduces significantly the contribution of lower-level processes. They also challenge the idea that proficient L2 readers, that is, those with a basic command of L2 vocabulary, syntax, and discourse markers, move away from using lower-level skills and rely instead on higher-level semantic and syntactic skins. Rather, the results indicate that in addition to more general language proficiency indices such as semantic and syntactic knowledge, individual differences In ESL reading need to be understood in respect to individual differences in lower-level processes, particularly, the efficiency with which readers process phonological and orthographic information.

"HIRAMATSU, MICHIKO",1982,AN INDIVIDUALIZED LEARNING PACKAGE PROGRAM IN BEGINNING COLLEGE JAPANESE: A MULTI-MEDIA APPROACH,"Statement of the Problem. Traditional instruction at Foothill Community College seems to have failed to meet the different needs and variations of students, which may have resulted in student dropouts. Therefore, this study was conducted in order to: (1) investigate the nature of the existing problem, i.e., the student dropouts, (2) develop and implement an effective program in an attempt to remove or treat the problem, and (3) assess in a tentative way if the specific program is producing the desired results. Procedure. This study, designed as an action research, investigated the student dropouts in the beginning Japanese classes. As a result, an individualized learning package program was conceptualized and developed. The individualized learning package program involved students' use of the textbook, video and audio cassette tapes, and magnetic-taped flashcards; small group conversation practice sessions with a tutor; and whole class sessions conducted by the instructor. Assessments were made in a tentative way to see if the program was producing the desired results: its effectiveness (1) as an instructional method was tested by content-by-objective-grid criterion-referenced tests; (2) as a remedy for the student dropout problem was examined by analyzing data from tutors' observations of the students and from students' evaluations in questionnaires and course completed forms. Results. The assessments revealed that the students learned satisfactorily. The student expressed favorable feelings towards this program. Although there were two students, out of twenty, who chose to complete two and three units, respectively, instead of the usual four, there were no dropouts. Conclusion. This program, since it was readily available at the students' convenience, was effective for busy students who held jobs; and since the students could learn in private it seemed to help release the students' tension and anxiety. The small group set-up seemed not only effective in conversation practice but also in forming mutual support relationships among the group members which contributed toward preventing dropouts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/individualized-learning-package-program-beginning/docview/303108069/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"SHULDBERG, HOWARD KELLY",1987,SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC ISSUES IN SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNING,"This dissertation examines second language acquisition in adults in terms of formal syntactic and semantic systems. A number of studies which stress the importance of semantic content from first language are reviewed, and the possibility that first language semantics might play an important role in interpretation of second language structures is considered. It is argued that while second language syntactic rules are learned independently from first language rules, the second language semantic system is highly dependent on first language semantics. The argument is made that not only does first language semantics play an important role in second languages with regard to lexical items, but that it also is largely responsible for the interpretation of complex strings which consist of several lexical items strung together. Two studies are reported which support the argument that first language semantics play a crucial role in second language processing. The first shows that learning difficulty for certain target language structures can be predicted in terms of the number of cognitive processes necessary to derive those structures from first language argument structures. The second shows that predicate-argument structure is more important in determining difficulty of second language structures than syntactic structure, even when syntactic structure mirrors that found in the first language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/syntactic-semantic-issues-second-language/docview/303490427/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Chan, Paul Huen",1988,"From colony to neighbor: Relations between Japan and South Korea, 1945-1985","This study is divided into two parts: a historical and an analytical section. In the historical section, the postwar relations between Japan and South Korea is divided into three periods: a Confrontation Period (1948-1960), a Cooperative Period (1961-1979) and finally a Competitive Period (1980-1985). The division into three periods coincided with the political tenure of three South Korean presidents: Syngman Rhee, Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo Hwan. Rhee was an independence fighter and he hates Japan. Park was a Japanese collaborator and he admires Japan. Lastly, Chun was raised in an anti-Japanese environment and he emphasizes national pride. In turn, Rhee's hatred of Japan led to confrontational diplomacy, Park's admiration of Japan led to cooperative diplomacy and Chun's national pride led to competitive diplomacy. In the analytical section, one positive and three negative factors are identified. The role of the United States as a referee is the only positive factor. Through behind-the-scene intervention, the United States helps to promote friendship and stability in Japan-South Korean relations. The three negative factors are: the remembrance of the colonial period, the presence of Korean minority in Japan and finally Japan's two-Korea policy. The first two factors are fading in importance. As South Korea grows richer and stronger, Koreans will find less psychological need to dwell on Japanese atrocities during the colonial period (1910-1945). In turn, the Japanese will respect the Koreans more. As second and third generation Koreans in Japan are being integrated into Japanese society, they have gradually turned their energy from traditional South-North competition to struggle for their own civil and political rights in Japan. The last negative factor, namely, Japan's two Korea policy, will continue to irritate South Korea. In the 1950s, Japan and South Korea exchanged mutual contempt and practised confrontational diplomacy. In 1965, normalization of relations was achieved after 14 years of tortuous negotiations. By 1985, a strong working relations and a feeling of mutual respect have been firmly established. This successful transformation is summarized in the title ""From Colony to Neighbors"".", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/colony-neighbor-relations-between-japan-south/docview/303576537/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hansell, Mark Donald",1989,Lexical borrowing in Taiwan,"The economic, political, and cultural history of 20th century Taiwan has led to a complex interplay of four major languages: Taiwanese, Japanese, Mandarin, and English. This study of the Taiwan loan lexicon examines the processes by which speakers of Taiwanese and Mandarin have replicated foreign vocabulary items in their own languages. The different types of substitution and adaptation (such as phonetic borrowing, calquing, and graphic borrowing) are viewed not as mechanical processes determined by structural differences between donor and recipient languages, but as a menu of options available to recipient-language speakers who employ different borrowing strategies depending on the sociolinguistic setting. Comparison of different borrowing paths (Japanese into Taiwanese, English into Mandarin, Japanese into Mandarin) points up the fact that language-contact conditions and channels of borrowing are the determinant factor in choice of borrowing strategy. The analysis of borrowing presented in this work is based on Weinreich and Haugen, but harks back ultimately to Saussure. Lexical borrowing is defined as the borrowing of a sign (in the Saussurean sense), with the recipient language constructing replicas of both the signifiant and the signifiee out of native materials. This picture is complicated in borrowing between two written languages, since the recipient language can replicate either the written signifiant (as in graphic borrowing) or the spoken signifiant (as in phonetic borrowing). In Mandarin, graphic borrowing between dialects has had a significant effect on the phonetic adaptation of foreign loans. In graphic loans of native Japanese (non-Sino-Japanese) forms, phonetic resemblance between model and replica may be entirely lost. In loans from other languages as well, written Chinese exercises a powerful effect on borrowing through transliteration, indirect dialectal borrowing, folk etymology, and alphabetic borrowing.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/lexical-borrowing-taiwan/docview/303678589/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Some words of exploration are necessary here for selecting grammatical features for inVestigation, rather than other properties of language use, such as pragmatics. This selection does not imply that such other features are of secondary value in curriculum design or syllabus construction, Obviously, various properties of target language and language use, sociolinguistic and pragmatic among others, deserve serious consideration in designing a curriculum, However, a psycho linguistically motivated acquisition model with implications for syllabus construction has great potential value to effectively fill the vacuum that exists between theories and the actual classroom.

"Thomas, Margaret Ann",1991,Universal Grammar and knowledge of reflexives in a second language,"This thesis addresses the debate about whether adult language learners have access to the principles and parameters of universal grammar (UG) in constructing the grammar of a foreign or second language (L2). A comprehension task investigates the interpretation of English reflexive pronouns by native speakers of Japanese and of Spanish (n = 132), and the interpretation of the Japanese reflexive zibun by native speakers of English and of Chinese (n = 42). The experimental stimuli include single- and bi-clausal sentences, sentences in which the anaphor appears inside an NP with a lexical subject, and sentences which test whether learners require c-commanding antecedents for reflexives. I evaluate the predictions of three hypotheses about the role of universal grammar in L2 acquisition: (A) that UG is unavailable, and that processing strategies or other non-linguistic principles guide L2 acquisition; (B) that UG is available only in the form in which it is instantiated in the learner's native language; (C) that UG is fully available, including the ability to re-set parameters in L2 to UG-sanctioned values not instantiated in the learner's native language. The results show that learners observe constraints defined by Manzini and Wexler's (1987) parameterized version of Principle A of the binding theory, constraints which learners could not have derived solely from inspection of the input data, nor from the treatment of anaphors in their native languages. Thus these results support the proposal that adult learners have access to universal grammar in their interpretations of anaphors in L2.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/universal-grammar-knowledge-reflexives-second/docview/303928716/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Miller, Mark Campbell",1992,Two experimental studies of the effectiveness of interactive game-playing in the acquisition of Japanese by Americans. (Volumes I and II),"The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that ""optimal L2 acquisition occurs through the playing of games."" Three Japanese language classes were taught for American university students over a two-year, four-semester period. Two classes used games as the primary instructional technique. A third control class was taught using traditional procedures. One game class provided native speaking Japanese mediators, explicit grammar explanations, sample demonstrations, detailed directions, strict control by the instructor, and transfer aids. The other game class had no mediators and avoided the explicit provision of the instructional variables listed above. At the end of each semester the students in all three classes were given a Cloze, an oral interview, and a written essay test. The mean scores were measured and analyzed by the univariate procedure and one-way and two-way ANOVAs. Extensive surveys, interviews, and ethnographic observations were conducted to complement the experiment. The results are as follows: (1) There were no significant differences between any two or among all three classes on any of the three tests after each of the four semesters. (2) The game classes outperformed the control class on all three tests by the fourth semester. (3) The score ranges in the game classes were smaller, suggesting that the transfer of L1 cognitive/academic language proficiency (CALP) to L2 acquisition is greater in traditional language classes than in game classes. Conversely, students with less L1 CALP can be more successful in game classes by relying on their basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS). (4) Significant differences were obtained when combined mean scores for all three classes were compared by semester. It is suggested that the introduction of imperative verb forms and relative/dependent clauses in the second and third semesters, respectively, lowered the scores of all three classes, regardless of the instructional method employed. This finding suggests the acquisition of Japanese as a L2 is constrained by processing constraints, not input constraints. The surveys, interviews, and ethnographic data indicate that while games are popular, they need to be carefully designed and employed to enable an entire L2 curriculum to be successfully developed around them.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/two-experimental-studies-effectiveness/docview/303984123/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nagata, Noriko",1992,A study of the effectiveness of intelligent CALI as an application of natural language processing,"Computers have long been regarded as a potential tool for accelerating the learning of a foreign language. Unfortunately, many attempts to incorporate computers into foreign language instruction have met with failure. One obstacle has been the relative 'primitiveness' of the existing Computer-Assisted Language Instruction (CALI) systems. Such systems typically provide mechanical drills involving fill-in-the-blank or multiple-choice questions, and utilize a ""wrong-try-again"" approach to interaction that offers little corrective feedback. In this study, I developed a new CALI system, called ""Nihongo-CALI"". This system employs one type of artificial intelligence approach, Natural Language Processing, to facilitate more sophisticated error analysis and feedback. The Nihongo-CALI system uses Natural Language Processing to analyze the learners responses in light of the morphological and syntactic rules of the Japanese language, and provides feedback explaining the errors in terms of grammatical functions and thematic roles of the sentence. The present study investigates the effect of the type of CALI exercises (traditional CALI exercises involving conventional feedback or intelligent CALI exercises providing sophisticated feedback) on students' language achievement and attitudes toward CALI exercises. The Nihongo-CALI system was implemented for both traditional CALI and intelligent CALI exercises, to process and to analyze the learner's input, but provided only limited feedback in simulating the traditional CALI approach. An experiment was performed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of these two types of Nihongo-CALI exercises. Thirty-four subjects in the second-year Japanese language course at the University of Pittsburgh participated in the experiment. The study found a statistically significant difference between the intelligent CALI and traditional CALI groups in the learners' achievement on the target structures, favoring the intelligent CALI group. The study suggests that the traditional feedback is as good as the intelligent feedback in helping learners to correct word-level errors (e.g., vocabulary and conjugation errors), while the intelligent feedback is more helpful for understanding and correcting sentence-level errors (e.g., particle errors).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/study-effectiveness-intelligent-cali-as/docview/304002080/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Takeuchi-Furuya, Reiko",1993,A study of the naturalistic acquisition of Japanese by two native speakers of English in Japan,"This dissertation is a longitudinal case study of the natural second language acquisition of Japanese by two speakers of English in Japan. The two female adult learners, instructors in English at junior high school in Japan, knew no Japanese on their arrival in Japan and received no formal instruction thereafter. The researcher (a native speaker of Japanese) met with each of the subjects once every two weeks for approximately a year. During these sessions, the learners performed a number of tasks in Japanese (making origami, describing pictures, teaching cooking and so on). In addition to transcribed data from those sessions, other sources of data included their scores on three tests (GEFT, MLAT and PLAB), questionnaires that they answered on affective variables and diaries that they kept throughout the study. The development of linguistic output by the two learners was very similar to the composite picture of the interlanguage continuum described by Ellis in 1984 (Classroom Second Language Development). At the end of the study, both learners were in the third stage of the continuum, just short of Ellis' last stage. The two learners' initial test scores were the same, and the questionnaire administered at the beginning of the study showed them to be very similar in attitude and other cognitive variables. The diaries kept throughout the study, however, showed differences in their reactions to their naturalistic language learning experiences in Japan. One learner reported feeling more confident and hopeful, less frustrated and angry, than the other. The two learners' developmental patterns in the acquisition of (a) negative inflection in Japanese and (b) Japanese particles were compared to the developmental patterns of Japanese children learning their first language. Both similarities and differences were found. The nature of the input received by the learners (i.e., the ""foreigner talk"" used by the researcher) was also analyzed. Not all features of typical foreigner talk were present at the beginning; some features increased in frequency as the study progressed, some features decreased, and some features remained constant.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/study-naturalistic-acquisition-japanese-two/docview/304077214/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Bennett, Susan",1994,Second language acquisition of reflexive binding by native speakers of Serbo-Croatian,"This thesis examines the role of transfer of first (L1) language properties and access to knowledge of Universal Grammar in second language (L2) acquisition. Two empirical components are included: a study of the syntax of anaphora in Serbo-Croatian and an experimental study of second language acquisition of reflexive binding. Data from field work on the coreference properties of anaphors in Serbo-Croatian are discussed in terms of standard, parameterized, LF movement, and Relativized SUBJECT approaches to Binding Theory. Recent versions of the theory identify a categorial distinction between morphologically simple ($\rm X\sp\circ$) and complex (XP) anaphor types as a crucial factor in determining coreference relations between reflexive pronouns and their syntactic antecedents. The predictions of a morphological approach to the Binding Theory were tested in a study of the acquisition of the binding properties of English XP reflexives by native speakers of Serbo-Croatian, a language with $\rm X\sp\circ$ reflexives. Acquisition of the English binding pattern by this group of L2 learners requires recognition of the morphological complexity of English reflexives. Prior to reanalysis, learners are predicted to produce an incorrect L1 coreference pattern in the L2 environment. Two sentence comprehension tasks were administered to adolescent and adult Serbo-Croatian speaking L2 learners of English and similar groups of English native speaker controls. Picture identification and multiple choice comprehension tasks produced convergent results with significant differences between control (n = 47) and L2 learner (n = 73) interpretations of reflexives in complex noun phrases and object control infinitival sentences. Their pattern of interpretation shows evidence of transfer of the $\rm X\sp\circ$ anaphor type found in Serbo-Croatian to the target grammar and suggests L2 learners are able to apply a deductive system constrained by Universal Grammar to compute binding domains in second language acquisition.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-reflexive-binding/docview/250766919/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Futaba, Terufumi",1994,Second language acquisition through negotiation: A case of non-native speakers who share the same first language,"This dissertation explores whether adult second language learners with the same first language (L1), can assist each others' second language acquisition (SLA) by providing three theoretically important conditions (input modified toward comprehensibility, negative input and the production of comprehensible output) when they are assigned communicative tasks (CTs). Recent SLA research suggests that opportunities for learners to be provided with these conditions can be maximized when both speakers try to negotiate message meaning. The study generated three important questions: (1) Do NNSs negotiate with each other to the extent that NNSs negotiate with native speaker (NS) on CTs? (2) To what extent does this negotiation provide them with each of the three conditions? and (3) What effects do task types, shared L1 and gender pairing have on their negotiation? The data were collected from 15 paired Japanese L1 NNSs as they interacted independently of their teacher in separate dyads during two different CTs. Each task required the spoken interaction of both members of the dyad. Analysis of the data revealed that: (1) NNSs negotiated significantly more in NNSs dyads than in NS-NNS dyads; (2) NNSs provided more negative input in NNS dyads than in NS-NNS dyads; (3) There was no significant difference in input modification between NNSs in NNS dyads and NS-NNS dyads; and (4) There was no significant difference in target like second language production between NNS in NNS dyads and in NS-NNS dyads. Taken together, the results revealed that the NNSs were able to provide each other with all three input and output conditions theorized as necessary for SLA. The study thus suggested that sharing a first language in the foreign language classroom can make a positive contribution to students' SLA.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-through-negotiation/docview/304132104/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Mori, Masako",1995,Reading bilingually: Cross-linguistic study of reading comprehension in English and Japanese by intermediate and advanced level Japanese speakers of English as a Second Language (ESL) and English speakers of Japanese as a Foreign Language (JFL),"L2 reading is paradoxical and ambiguous because it aims at ""reading for meaning"" and ""reading for language learning"" at the same time. The present study investigated how people read English and Japanese expository texts as either L1 or L2. Using think-aloud protocols while reading texts, comprehension processes were compared between L1 and L2 readers, as well as low- and high-L2 proficiency readers, quantitatively and qualitatively. The comprehension product data (comprehension question scores, summary scores) complemented the results. The multivariate design was 2 (L1 background: Native Reader of English (NRE), Native Reader of Japanese (NRJ)) by 2 (L2 proficiency level: high, low) by 2 (reading condition: silent, think-aloud) by 4 (texts: E1, E2, J1, J2), with the first two as between-subject and the second two as within-subject variables. The results of qualitative analysis indicated: (1) There were very clear differences between L1 and L2 reading in all measures. L1 reading comprehension was almost always better than L2 reading comprehension regardless of language in all measures. (2) Detailed analysis of think-aloud protocols showed that L1 reading proceeded by using ""reacting/responding,"" ""evaluative comment,"" and ""self-questioning"" strategies-all top-down strategies. L2 reading, on the other hand, was characterized by a combination of three basic bottom-up strategies: ""questioning of vocabulary,"" ""translating,"" and ""word-solving."" (3) The effect of proficiency was found only partially in NRE in comprehension question scores and as an interaction between proficiency and strategy types of think-aloud data. Strategically, high L2 proficiency readers used more metacognitive strategies (comment on own strategy; monitor comprehension) than low L2 readers. (4) No effect was found with reading conditions (silent, think-aloud) in all measures. Qualitative analysis of think-aloud protocols and four case studies revealed insightful processes happening during reading in the course of time. The most important finding was that L1 reading operated in a social-dialogic dimension, while L2 reading tended to lack this dimension and be confined within a text linguistic domain. A new model of reading to expand the cognitive reading model and to incorporate a social dimension was proposed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/reading-bilingually-cross-linguistic-study/docview/304200499/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Chikamatsu, Nobuko",1995,The effects of L1 orthography on L2 word recognition: A study of American and Chinese learners of Japanese,"Lexical judgment tests using Japanese kana (a syllabic script: hiragana and katakana) were performed on 45 English and 17 Chinese speaking learners of Japanese. Visual familiarity and word length in words were controlled to examine phonological/visual dependence in word recognition. Visual familiarity was tested using three types of word stimuli: visually familiar, visually unfamiliar and nonword. Visually familiar words were kana words written in a conventional script (katakana words which are conventionally written in katakana and hiragana words which are conventionally written in hiragana). Visually unfamiliar words were written in an unconventional script (katakana words which are conventionally written in hiragana and hiragana words which are conventionally written in katakana). Nonwords were pronounceable, but not actual Japanese words. The stimuli word length varied from 2 to 5 kana letters. English and Chinese subject responses were compared in terms of reaction time and error rate. According to the hypothesis, it was predicted that (1) subject dependence on visual information in words would cause increased response times for unfamiliar word stimuli, and (2) subject dependence on the phonological information in words would cause increased reaction times as word length increased. The results demonstrate several differences between the subject groups tested. First, Chinese subject reaction times increased more than those of English subjects in unfamiliar word conditions versus familiar word conditions. Second, no greater increase in the reaction times of Chinese subjects was observed between unfamiliar word and nonword conditions. Third, differences between the subject groups were more apparent under hiragana conditions than katakana conditions. Fourth, the effects of word length variations on reaction times were stronger among English subjects than among Chinese subjects. These results indicate that (1) Chinese L1 speakers rely more on the visual information in L2 Japanese kana words than do English L1 speakers, and (2) English L1 speakers utilize the phonologic information in words more than Chinese L1 speakers. Accordingly, these findings demonstrate that English and Chinese speaking subjects utilize different word recognition strategies due to the L1 orthographic characteristics and the L1 word recognition strategies are transferred into L2 Japanese kana word recognition.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-l1-orthography-on-l2-word-recognition/docview/304214241/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tomita, Hideo",1995,Identifying and explaining L2 learners' difficulties: A case of the Japanese particles WA and GA,"The usage of the Japanese particles WA or GA are notoriously difficult for teachers to teach and for learners to master. Linguistic classification of these particles is helpful only in a limited way. Tomita (1994) suggests that the usage is difficult to generalize because there are many cases that either particle is possible. He observes that there are at least three types of linguistic contexts for WA and GA: (1) GA only, (2) WA only, and (3) cases where the selection is left with the writer/speaker. Tomita and Hiki (1994) empirically confirmed this observation with 100 native speakers of Japanese who showed various degrees of variability in selecting the particles, including two cases of complete split judgement. This dissertation is a continuation of the above studies with L2 Japanese learners. It investigated the effect of linguistic ""cues"" that were hypothesized to affect the selection of the Japanese particles WA and GA in a cloze test. Following Kail (1989), two major types of cues were assumed: local cues and global (Kail's topological) cues. It was hypothesized that the selection of WA or GA involving global cues would be more difficult and acquired later than those involving local cues because the former would require a larger amount of cross-referencing for interpretation to occur than do the latter. A cloze test was administered with 35 adult L2 Japanese learners at a university in the U.S. There were three independent variables: cue type (local vs. global), particle type (WA vs. GA) and proficiency level (2nd, 3rd regular, 3rd intensive, and 4th year level). The dependent variable was incorrect response score. The results indicated with statistically significant differences that subjects made more mistakes with global cues than local cues, and with GA than WA. The difference in proficiency level was not statistically significant and no interaction among the variables was observed. The overall result was interpreted to indicate that the global environment manifested itself as a major source of difficulty, providing a new focus for research and teaching of WA and GA.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/identifying-explaining-l2-learners-difficulties/docview/304230049/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Baba, Junko",1996,A study of interlanguage pragmatics: Compliment responses by learners of Japanese and English as a second language,"The purpose of this study is to identify the sociolinguistic variables that may affect the types of Compliment Responses (CRs) given by learners of Japanese and English as a second language. To investigate interlanguage CRs, this study compares learner data with baseline data taken from native Japanese and American English speakers. The sociolinguistic variables examined were the targets (Family versus Self) and topics (External versus Internal) of compliments. The variables were combined into four target-topic categories: Family External, Family Internal, Self External, and Self Internal. A total of 60 informants participated in the study, of which 12 were American native speakers of English (AAs), 17 were native speakers of Japanese (JJ), 14 were Japanese learners of English (ESL); and 17 were American learners of Japanese (JSLs). Each informant had a 30 to 60 minute conversation session with a female friend, or conversation leader, who was a native speaker of the language in which the conversation was conducted. The data were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. All data were tape-recorded, narrowly transcribed, and coded accordingly to Brown and Levinson's (1987) politeness types: Positive Politeness, Negative Politeness, Off-Record, and Do-not-Do-FTA (Face Threatening Act). For overall politeness types, CRs of the learners were found to approximate those of the native speakers of the target languages. A detailed examination of the sociolinguistic variables of CRs and the ""dispreferredness"" structure in discourse, however, revealed problems among learners. It was noted in the baseline data that the most significant difference was between the JJs and the AAs in Negative Politeness for the Family External CRs. Both JSLs and ESLs used pragmatic transfer from their respective L1s in the Family variable. In the Self variable, the JSLs overgeneralized the Japanese formal CRs of Refusal. The study also investigated the correlation between politeness types of CRs and the intensity of the compliments, as well as aspects of complimenting sequences. Only among AAs did Positive Politeness CRs correlate with the increased intensity of the compliments, while ESLs seemed embarrassed by exaggerated compliments. The Japanese tend to prefer longer sequences than Americans.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/study-interlanguage-pragmatics-compliment/docview/304274152/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Mori, Junko",1996,Negotiating agreement and disagreement: The use of connective expressions in Japanese conversations,"The present study investigates ways in which Japanese speakers negotiate agreement and disagreement in sequences involving opinion or evaluation. Using the sociological methodology of ""conversation analysis"" (CA) (cf. Sacks, Schegloff, Jefferson) as a central framework for analysis, the present thesis explicates the sequential development of negotiation towards agreement as well as the structure of each turn within the sequence. Further, this study, as a part of the growing body of research on ""interaction and grammar,"" explores the relationship between the structures of social interaction and the structures of the language, focusing on the recurrent use of two structurally different types of connective expressions: the clause-initial connectives, dakara, datte, and demo, and the clause-final connective particles, -kara, and -kedo. The use of these different types of ""causal"" or ""contrastive"" markers exhibits the speaker's engagement in different types of activities involved in the negotiation of their opinions and evaluations. The goal of this study is to examine the occurrences of these markers with reference to the sequential environment of their use and the interactional activities accomplished by their use. As an initial step in the application of the CA methodology to Japanese conversations, the present thesis suggests the existence of some generic organizations of conversational interaction common across languages and cultures. The data, which consist of six audio-recorded causal conversations among Japanese adult peers, demonstrate that the Japanese speakers shape agreeing or disagreeing turns, or respond to actual or anticipated problems in interaction, in remarkably similar ways to those reported in the CA studies of American English conversations. On the other hand, the structural differences between the languages, namely English and Japanese, appear to alter the kinds of resources available for accomplishing a particular action; they also seem to partially change the temporal realization of actions in progress. Through the close analysis of ""opinion-negotation"" sequences and the use of connective expressions within those sequences, the present study explores the interplay of the structural differences between the languages and the realization of the potentially universal features of human interaction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/negotiating-agreement-disagreement-use-connective/docview/304284707/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Wannaruk, Anchalee",1997,Back-channel behavior in Thai and American casual telephone conversations,"Although back channel behavior is universal, its usage and use vary from one culture to another. The purpose of the study is to investigate the similarities and differences in back channel behavior by Thais and Americans in terms of frequency, types, locations and functions. Gender was also studied to see if it was related to back channel behavior. The data consisted of 10 hours of telephone discourse collected from 60 same-sex dyads, 30 American and 30 Thai pairs. The results suggest that there were both similarities and differences in the two language groups. The data revealed that Thais employed back channels more frequently than Americans did but the difference existed only between the male groups. The overwhelming majority of back channels in both groups fell within the short utterance category. The second and third most used categories were laughter and short questions. Brief restatements and sentence completions were the fourth and fifth last choices respectively. In terms of the location of back channels, the only thing Thais and Americans had in common was the location where back channels occurred the most, clausal units. The discourse environment which was used significantly more by Thais than Americans was after clausal units, whereas the environments which were used significantly more by Americans than Thais included during speech lap and after conjunctions. The study also showed that in both groups the most frequently displayed function of back channel was understanding. Showing emotional response was the second most frequent reason for use. The third and fourth most displayed functions for Thais were asking for clarification and display of agreement whereas for Americans they were display of agreement and asking for clarification. The least common function in both groups was that of continuer. In both languages short utterances tended to show understanding, short questions to request clarification, and laughter to display emotional response. In Thai brief restatements were likely to show agreement whereas in American English sentence completions were related to the function of understanding.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/back-channel-behavior-thai-american-casual/docview/304345276/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Song, Grace U.",1997,Cross-linguistic differences in the expression of motion events and their implications for second language acquisition,"This work examines lexical knowledge in second language acquisition through a case study of motion expressions and their acquisition by second language learners. Systematic cross-linguistic differences have been attested in the expression of motion events: two distinct patterns for expressing motion can be found across languages. The expression of motion thus provides a well-defined domain for studying the transfer and acquisition of lexical knowledge in a second language. My research indicates that second language learners have underlying knowledge of certain universal aspects of verb meaning, and that this knowledge guides them in their acquisition of motion expressions in their second language even when their first and second languages differ in this respect. I first propose an analysis of motion events and their expression from an event-structure perspective. On this account, motion events can be classified into one of several types according to elements of meaning that have been identified as being relevant to syntax across languages. Languages differ, however, in how these meaning components can be combined within lexical items and phrases. In particular, languages differ whether type-shifting is possible, or, the ability of verbs and other lexical items associated with simple event types to combine and express a complex event type. I propose that the cross-linguistic differences in the expression of motion events are due to the difference in the availability of type-shifting. Besides more accurately accounting for cross-linguistic differences in the expression of motion, my analysis makes predictions about how motion expressions can be acquired when the first and second language differ with respect to type-shifting. Talking about a motion event involves knowledge of semantically based event types, relevant in all languages, and knowledge of language-specific compositional possibilities. If learners construe motion events in terms of the relevant event types, certain properties of the input should alert them to the type-shifting possibilities in their second language. I test these predictions in three experiments and find that learners make the relevant distinctions among event types in their second language, which in turn, should help them learn to express motion events appropriately in their second language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/cross-linguistic-differences-expression-motion/docview/304359991/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hamilton, Robert Lee",1997,Underdetermined binding: An HPSG binding theory and experimental study of adult Japanese learners of English as a Second Language,"In this dissertation I accomplish two main objectives. First, I develop a theory of anaphoric and personal-pronominal binding within the framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) that is empirically more satisfying and internally more coherent than previous accounts, including among others the standard HPSG binding theory of Pollard &amp; Sag (1992, 1994) and the reflexive-marking account of Reinhart &amp; Reuland (1991, 1993). Second, with this theory of binding in view I report on a series of experiments with adult Japanese-speaking learners of English (and native English-speaking controls) designed to investigate whether adult second language (L2) learners are sensitive to the domain of Binding Condition A in English. In the main experiment, 85 L2 subjects and 85 native controls were administered two tasks, a written sentence-completion task for screening purposes and a written truth-value judgment task for measuring subjects' acceptance of nonlocal binding in English. The L2 learners, like the native controls, accepted significantly more nonlocal binding of English reflexive anaphors when the anaphor was in a structural position exempt from Condition A (e.g. the object of certain picture-NPs) than when in a position subject to Condition A (e.g. a direct object), as determined by a logistic regression analysis of the data (z = 3.96, p $&lt;$ 0.0001 for L2 Group; z = 6.70, p $&lt;$ 0.0001 for Control Group). I argue that this outcome constitutes an underdetermined binding pattern for the L2 learners given certain features of the L2 English input and of the learners' native Japanese. This in turn suggests that these adult L2 learners had direct access to Binding Condition A, hence to Universal Grammar.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/underdetermined-binding-hpsg-theory-experimental/docview/304366143/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Philips, Mieko Kimura",1998,"Discourse markers in Japanese: Connectives, fillers, and interactional particles","This dissertation analyzes the functions of Japanese connectives, fillers, and interactional particles as discourse markers used by native and normative speakers of Japanese, using Schiffrin's (1987) framework. Quantitative analysis of these markers in relation to sociolinguistic factors is also presented. Schiffrin analyzes 11 English discourse markers using the discourse model she proposes, consisting of five planes of talk: the ideational, exchange and action structures, the participation framework, and the information state. She argues that with their indexical functions, English discourse markers provide textual and participant coordinates for an utterance, elucidating its relationship to prior and/or upcoming utterances, or to the interlocutors. Based upon the naturally occurring speech data, I argue that Japanese connectives, fillers, and interactional particles operate in much the same way as English discourse markers. Discourse markers are indispensable part of Japanese conversation with their functions as utterance-initial, utterance-medial and utterance-final brackets of units of talk. The connective de 'and', for example, functions as a textual coordinate, connecting utterances which are in a sequential or cause-effect relationship. It also functions as a marker of speaker continuation. Fillers not only function as pause-filling devices but also display the speaker's thoughts and feelings, such as uncertainty and hesitation. Interactional particles also reveal the speaker's feelings or attitude towards a proposition and/or the hearer. My data suggest that the speaker's gender and speech genre are the most significant factor in the use of connectives. In the use of fillers, formality is the most significant factor. Formality and speech genre are most significantly related to the use of interactional particles. As regards the use of Japanese discourse markers by non-native speakers, it was found that: (1) their proficiency level and the length of formal study are the two most significant factors in their discourse marker usage, and (2) when a marker has both referential and interactional functions, the former are learned before the latter. Finally, I propose that, given their importance in natural conversation, the roles and use of discourse markers be consciously taught in Japanese language classrooms.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/discourse-markers-japanese-connectives-fillers/docview/304433430/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Morise, Yumiko",1998,A discourse analysis of negotiated interactions in oral proficiency interviews: Japanese learners of English as a Second Language,"The increased demand for the development of communicative language use in second language (L2) education has led to language-assessment practices designed to demonstrate L2 learners' ability to use language in 'real-life' situations. While there has been a widely accepted view that the most adequate method is the oral proficiency interview (OPI), one critical issue is to what degree OPI methods can replicate 'real-life' language use. This study addresses this issue by identifying the types and frequency of repair strategies used by both interviewers and Japanese learners of English as a second language to overcome communication problems, and sequence patterns and functions in twelve tape-recorded OPIs at four proficiency levels (1+, 2, 2+, and 3). It also examines the nature of OPI negotiated interactions in comparison with that of native speaker (NS)-nonnative speaker (NNS) interactions in previous second language acquisition (SLA) research. The results suggest that negotiated interactions that take place in resolving communication problems during an OPI, in a broad sense, resemble those that have been demonstrated in SLA research. However, since one important requirement of the OPI is to demonstrate candidates' limitations in communicating, interviewers attempt to push at the boundaries of the candidates' proficiency rather than striving to stay within them. Unlike NSs in SLA-research settings, interviewers manipulate repair discourse and the amount and quality of repair strategies in an attempt to elicit ratable speech samples. For this reason, OPI negotiations typically persist much longer than those seen in SLA research. Candidates, regardless of proficiency levels, more frequently initiate overt indications of communication difficulties. They also produce a larger amount of elaborated speech, exhibiting their efforts to demonstrate their communication skills. Results suggest that this form of negotiation is an important aspect of the OPI assessment. Further examination of the OPI negotiated interactions suggests that the following variability factors merit closer attention in future research and in improving current OPI practices: various situational and individual characteristics, interviewers' diagnostic skills and the nature of their support, and interviewers' judgments about the quality of changes produced in candidates' performance during negotiation processes.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/discourse-analysis-negotiated-interactions-oral/docview/304436159/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zuck, Gregory V.",1998,Elements of a child's second language maintenance in her first language environment: A case study of Aika,"The purpose of this study was to assess the degree of improvement, maintenance or loss of particular L2 features by a child L2 speaker who was reimmersed in her first language environment. The study focused on the participant's accuracy, during spontaneous conversational interaction, in the use of (a) verb inflections for tense, aspect and number; (b) genitive (possessive) lexical items and (-s) form; (c) number (singular and plural) marking; (d) copula verb ('is/are'); (e) negation patterns; and (f) interrogative patterns. Additionally, the participant's semantic use of the verb 'do' was assessed as a potential indicator of specific L2 lexical item loss, and the participant's overall use of discourse compensation strategies were assessed as potential indicators of overall L2 loss. The participant was a Japanese first language (L1) speaker who lived in the United States with her family for almost two years, until she was six and a half years of age. One year after the family's return to Japan the girl became my student at an English conversation school in Japan. She attended weekly lessons with me for almost three years, during which time this study's data was collected over a period of one and a half years.

"Tanaka, Junko",1999,Implicit /explicit learning of focus marking in Japanese as a foreign language: A case of learning through output and negative feedback,"This dissertation investigates effects of output and negative feedback (NF) on the learning of a conceptually complex target language domain: the morphosyntactic marking of focus using the particle ga in argument-focus identificational sentences. Research in cognitive psychology and linguistics suggests that output and NF that makes use of metalinguistic explanation help second language (L2) learners to attend to relevant form-meaning relations in the target domain. This hypothesis was tested experimentally. Participants were 52 adult learners of Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) whose first languages (Lls), mostly English and Chinese, do not mark focus morphologically. A computer-assisted L2 learning and testing environment was set up. The experiment was carried out individually in three sessions and lasted for about 20 days. Interventions happened only once, at the beginning of the experiment. Learners' accuracy was tracked during the training and the five tests, and the relationship between their accuracy and certainty was tracked at the beginning and the end of each session. The results of the study demonstrated a clear effect of NF that includes metalinguistic information. NF affected the accuracy of participants' L2 construction, and accuracy in turn affected certainty in their estimate of their answers' correctness. NF appears to increase the salience of the critical features of complex concepts. Explicit learning through such NF is thus argued to have educational benefits for adult L2 learners, and may be necessary for those whose Ll lacks a surface form functionally similar to that of the L2. Output production was also demonstrated to facilitate adult L2 learning of complex concepts, although its effects were slow to emerge. The semantic content of noun phrases (NPs) differentially affected the difficulty of acquiring a syntactic structure that included them: the more typical such NPs are as topic, the more difficult it was for learners to use them as focus elements and to mark them with ga in argument focus sentences. Taken together, these results support the overall pedagogical benefits of explicit learning of complex concepts, especially for learners whose L Is are more likely to cause negative transfer to the L2 and who are in FL learning contexts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/implicit-explicit-learning-focus-marking-japanese/docview/304570334/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Karacaer, Zehra",2003,The Role of Processing Instruction : a Study on English Causatives,"This study attempts to examine possible effects of two types of instruction: processing (PI) and traditional (TI) in learning of English causatives by Turkish learners and to see whether possible positive effects are retained well over time by PI and Tl groups. For this study, seven classes of 120 Turkish students at the School of Foreign Languages at Anadolu University, Eskişehir, Turkey were randomly assigned to three groups: (a) processing instruction, (b) traditional instruction, and (c) no instruction. Two different instructional packets and a pretest and a post / follow-up test were administered. The tests consisted of two taskg: interpretation and production. The pretest was given two weeks before the treatment. The procedure regarding the treatment and the posttest spanned two 50-minute class periods. Five weeks later, the posttest was given as the follow-up test. Raw scores from the pretest, posttest, and follow-up test were submitted to a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results were shown in tables and figures. The results of the analysis of the interpretation data indicated that both the PI and TI groups resulted in some kind of knowledge gain due to the treatments. Both the PI and TI groups had a positive effect on how learners interpreted the English causatives. The effects both the PI and TI groups were retamed over time. The results of the analysis of the production data indicated that both the PI and TI groups resulted in some kind of knowledge gain due to the treatments. Both the PI and TI groups had a positive effect on how learners produced the English causatives.

"Jimenez Jimenez, Antonio Francisco",2003,Linguistic and psychological dimensions of second language attrition during and after a study abroad experience,"After more than two decades of investigation, studies on language attrition have failed to generate findings that enable us to develop a coherent understanding of attrition. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore an innovative way of approaching attrition that links social participation to linguistic production and psychological functioning. To achieve this goal, the study was carried out within a Sociocultural Theoretic framework. In addition, unlike the cross-sectional perspective adopted in most language attrition research, the current study followed a longitudinal design. Ten L2 adult learners of Spanish taking part in a five-month study abroad program participated in the study. The participants were interviewed during their experience in Spain and then again during a seven-month period following their return to the U.S. in order to observe potential development/attrition in the same group of individuals over time. Information was collected on the types and on the amount of time the learners spent engaging in Spanish-mediated activities during and after their experience abroad. Based on this, participants were divided into two groups—participation and non participation—for the purpose of carrying out the relevant linguistic and psychological analyses. Data for the study was elicited in the form of written and oral story narrations which were collected five times throughout the twelve-month period. The texts were analyzed at two levels: linguistic, which focused on specific formal features of the learners' performance; psychological, which analyzed communicative and avoidance strategies as manifestations of students' attempts to maintain and regain self-regulation (i.e., control) over the tasks. The results suggest that degree of participation has an impact on students' level of control over a seemingly invariable linguistic system. That is, students did not experience difficulties with the formal features but they did have significant problems at the psychological level. Given sufficient time to plan, monitor, and focus on the linguistic problems, students were able to resolve linguistic difficulties but, as the analysis shows, over time those who did not maintain contact with Spanish upon returning to the US had considerable problems on the psychological plain with regard to their ability to maintain self-regulation during linguistic performance.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/linguistic-psychological-dimensions-second/docview/304251099/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Dhanesschaiyakupta, Ubon",2003,L1 orthography: The effects on L2 word recognition of Thai and Chinese ESL learners,"This study investigated the effects of L1 (first language) orthography on L2 (second language) word recognition. The issue investigated was whether word recognition mechanism developed and used in reading in one orthography is transferred to reading in another orthography, regardless of the degree of similarity in the structural and representational properties of the two orthographies. Previous cross-linguistics research has suggested that readers with different L1 orthographies develop different L1 mechanisms, which differentially affect their L2 word recognition mechanisms. This study tested this issue. Two experimental tasks—naming and homophone judgment—were conducted with 70 adult L2 learners of English with contrasting L1 orthographic backgrounds (Thai and Chinese) and 20 native speakers of English (for a native baseline). The lexicality in stimuli in the naming task and the relationships between the cohort and core words in the homophone judgment task were controlled to explore the participants' dependence on phonological information in word recognition. The performances of the two ESL groups were compared on the basis of reaction time and accuracy. The results for the naming task indicate (a)&#xa0;faster and more accurate recognition via the phonological mechanism used by the Thai group relative to the orthographic mechanism used by the Chinese group; (b)&#xa0;the influence of the frequency effect on the performances of the two groups; and (c)&#xa0;the influence of the expected regularity effects on the performance of the Thai group and of the unexpected regularity effects on the performance of the Chinese group. The results for the homophone judgment task reveal (a)&#xa0;faster recognition of the Thai group compared with the Chinese group, indicating more facilitation imposed by the mechanism used by the Thai group than by the mechanism used by the Chinese group; and (b)&#xa0;stronger effects of the inconsistency between spelling and sound on the Chinese than on the Thai groups. These findings show that Thai readers rely more on phonological information, while the Chinese readers depend more on visual information. Findings indicate that the native Thai and Chinese readers utilize different word recognition mechanisms developed as a consequence of the characteristics of their L1 orthographies, and those word recognition mechanisms are transferred into L2 English word recognition.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l1-orthography-effects-on-l2-word-recognition/docview/305315943/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Acartürk, Cengiz",2005,Gradient Characteristics of the Unaccusative/Unergative Distinction in Turkish : An Experimental Investigation,"This thesis investigates the gradient behaviour of monadic intransitive verb classes in Turkish, under an aspectual classification of the unaccusative/unergative verb types, namely The Split Intransitivity Hierarchy. This Hierarchy claims that intransitive verb types are subject to gradient acceptability in certain syntactic constructions. The methods used in judgment elicitation studies in psychophysics, such as the magnitude estimation technique have recently been adapted to be used in capturing gradient linguistic data. Also, the practical benefits of the Internet directed researchers to design and conduct web-based experiments for linguistic data elicitation. Research on Human Computer Interaction offers suggestions for the design of more usable user interfaces. Considering these developments, in this thesis, a web based experiment interface has been designed as an extension to the magnitude estimation technique to elicit acceptability judgments on two syntactic constructions, i.e. the - mIş participle (the unaccusative diagnostic) and impersonal passivization (the unergative diagnostic) for different verb types on the Split Intransitivity Hierarchy. The experiment was conducted on the Internet. The results show that in the two diagnostics, the verb types receive categorical or indeterminate acceptability judgments, which allows us to specify the core or peripheral status of the verbs. Within the classes we have examined, change of state verbs constitute the core unaccusative verbs, and controlled (motional and non-motional) process verbs constitute the core unergative verbs. Stative verbs and uncontrolled process verbs are peripheral unaccusatives and unergatives, respectively. Change of location verbs (with an animate subject) are close to the unergative end.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/gradient-characteristics-unaccusative-unergative/docview/3122725342/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

English LI speakers and advanced Japanese learners of English performed a written version and an auditory version of sentence interpretation tasks containing two types of ambiguities: prepositional phrase (PP) attachment and wh-clause attachment ambiguities. The results from the written task observed Japanese learners’ preference for verb attachment in both types of constructions when compared with the English L1 speakers. However, the auditory task indicated that for both LI and L2 groups, no significant effects of high pitch accent on determining the attachment site of the phrases in either type of ambiguity, indicating that pitch accent plays little role in PP attachment and wh-clause attachment disambiguation for both LI speakers and L2 learners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-pitch-accent-on-ambiguous-sentence/docview/2581595228/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kayama, Yuhko",2006,Second language acquisition of Japanese relative clauses,"This thesis investigates the second language acquisition of Japanese relative clauses (RCs) by native speakers of English or Korean. Researchers have argued that Universal Grammar (UG) can be accessed in adult second language (L2) acquisition. The Full Transfer Full Access (FTFA) Hypothesis (Schwartz and Sprouse 1994, 1996) claims that after initial transfer from L1, learners reset their parameter values and are able to acquire L2 properties that are different from their L1. Japanese and English relativization: while Japanese relativization does not involve movement in the syntax (Kuno 1973, Saito 1985, etc.), English relativization involves obligatory operator movement and is subject to movement constraints like Subjacency. Because of Subjacency, certain RC structures are prohibited in English. In Japanese, on the other hand, a zero pronominal, pro , is base-generated in the gap position of an RC and coindexed with the relative head noun, and thus long distance relativization is possible. I argue that the presence or absence of pro is also a parametric difference between Japanese and English; pro is present in Japanese, but not in English. In order for English speakers to acquire Japanese RCs, they need to reset the values of these two parameters. Experimental studies were conducted with high-intermediate and advanced learners of Japanese (15 English speakers and 18 Korean speakers). Tests examined the learners' knowledge of the two grammatical properties in Japanese---namely, the lack of wh-movement and the presence of pro . Korean is different from English but similar to Japanese with respect to the parameters in question. Following FTFA, it is hypothesized that English-speaking learners initially transfer their L1 values, and that eventually they are able to switch parameters to the L2 values by accessing UG. The results of several tasks (including interpretation tasks and judgment tasks) confirm this hypothesis; while Korean speakers generally performed well irrespective of proficiency levels, English-speaking intermediate learners transferred their L1 values, failing to accept grammatical Japanese sentences that are not possible in English. English-speaking advanced learners, on the other hand, performed better than intermediate learners, and exhibited evidence that they had acquired the two properties of Japanese, supporting FTFA.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-japanese-relative/docview/304931766/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Husseinali, Ghassan T. A.",2006,Processability and development of syntax and agreement in the interlanguage of learners of Arabic as a foreign language,"This study investigated the development of the interlanguage of learners of Arabic as a foreign language from a processability perspective as presented in Pienemann (1998). Pienemann's Processability Theory (PT) procedures were applied to seven syntactic structures of Arabic and accordingly three stages of development in the interlanguage (IL) of learners of Arabic as a foreign language (AFL) were predicted. Attributive adjectives were predicted to be acquired at stage 3, followed by predicative adjectives, SV and VS at stage 4. Vcomp (to+Vclause), embedded clauses (that+clause) and adjectival clauses were predicted to be acquired at stage 5. According to PT, second language development should proceed in an implicational hierarchy i.e. no stage skipping. In addition to syntactic development, acquisition of four gender-number agreement combinations on verbs and adjectives was investigated. Data for this study were elicited at two points of time from six AFL learners evenly distributed over three levels on instruction yielding 679 minutes of recording. Data elicitation depended largely on free production. However, in the first two levels picture description was part of the elicitation procedure. The results of this study indicate that although there was no stage skipping, there was variability between structures within the same stage. For example, both VS and SV were predicted to develop at stage 4; however, SV was acquired before VS. In fact, VS word order was acquired only after two other structures in stage 5 were acquired. Among the seven syntactic structures we found an implicational order, independent of stages, represented in five developmental sequences. In terms of gender-number agreement combinations, the findings indicate that, in general, combination in which the number is singular were acquired before combinations in which the number is plural regardless of gender and that combinations in which the gender is masculine were acquired before combinations in which the gender is famine regardless of number. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed in light of input, L1 transfer, markedness and restructuring. In conclusion, this study suggests modifying input to include form-meaning activities following Van Patten's (2002, 2004) Processing Instruction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processability-development-syntax-agreement/docview/304982153/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Cook, Thomas",2006,An investigation of shame and anxiety in learning English as a second language,"The influence of shame and anxiety on learning English as a second-language was investigated. The English language experiences of thirty foreign college students in the United States were recorded in fifty hours of clinical interviews and then coded for their emotional and behavioral content. Anxiety as a factor in second-language learning was compared to a discrete emotions approach that explained the same material. These emotions included shame, fear, guilt, distress, and surprise. As part of the analysis, the explanatory power of the anxiety paradigm versus a discrete emotions approach was compared. The discrete emotions approach using shame was found to be superior to the traditional anxiety paradigm. It gave a clearer picture and a better, more fundamental, explanation of the kinds of maladaptive behaviors that interfere with learning a second-language. Shame over one's English language abilities was a prominent factor in the experience of a majority of the interviewees. Avoiding English language situations where shame might be experienced was common. In addition, shame often inhibited full participation in ongoing situations where English was being spoken. Other emotions, especially fear and anger, worked in conjunction with shame to inhibit learning English. A shame-fear cycle was identified where fear of shame turned out to be a major factor in English language avoidance behavior. A shame-anger relationship was also identified. In many cases, a shame reaction produced an ensuing anger reaction as a defense. In some cases, the shame was unacknowledged and hidden beneath the anger. The difference between guilt and shame reactions to perceived language failure was also explored. Either one could be set off by equivalent events. Guilt reactions were due to specific localized self-attributions concerning failure, whereas shame was a result of global attributions about the entire self as being deficient. Guilt often resulted in reparative behavior, such as additional second-language engagement or studying harder. Shame commonly fostered avoidance and withdrawal behavior. This study found that anxiety is an umbrella term for at least five discrete emotions and suggests that a discrete emotions approach can be used to re-evaluate existing work concerning the role of anxiety in learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigation-shame-anxiety-learning-english-as/docview/305275211/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Centering second language (SL) speakers' experience: A study of SL speakers' resistance to pragmatic norms of the SL community. Study III. Web -based curriculum for pragmatics instruction in Japanese as a foreign language: An explicit awareness -raising approach","This dissertation attempts to respond to current gaps in L2 pragmatics education and research in its alternative format with three independent studies. Studies I and II challenge the conventional assumption that acquiring nativelike pragmatic competence is the goal of all learners, and explore L2 speakers' pragmatic L2 use in relation to their subjectivity. Study I investigates the stated reasons that seven advanced Japanese learners provided for their pragmatic choices. Interviews and follow-up e-mail correspondence examined learners' deliberate pragmatic decisions made while performing elicitation tasks. The interviews identified instances where learners intentionally accommodated to or resisted perceived L2 pragmatic norms. The learners largely converged towards L2 norms to emulate the culture, while they sometimes intentionally diverged from L2 norms to resist certain L2 pragmatic uses (e.g., higher-level honorifics). Their agency can be explained by speech accommodation theory (Beebe &amp; Giles, 1984) which views learners' pragmatic decisions as the enactment of their social, psychological, and affective dispositions. L2 speakers' resistance to L2 norms is further investigated in Study II through a phenomenological inquiry into their lived experiences. The meaning of resistance was explored based on six interviews with fluent SL speakers of English and Japanese. These speakers were found to sometimes deliberately diverge from SL norms that conflicted with their own standards to express their subjectivity or to deliberately maintain distance from the SL community. In their acts of resistance, SL speakers negotiated their subjectivity and contested pre-existing SL norms in the community. Study III attempts to respond to the current paucity of L2 pragmatics curriculum/instruction by describing a web-based curriculum and reporting its preliminary effects on learners' pragmatic awareness. In this curriculum designed for intermediate/advanced foreign language learners of Japanese, explicit awareness-raising (Kasper &amp; Schmidt, 1996) tasks guided learners to self-discover a range of L2 pragmatic norms. The curriculum features naturalistic audio samples, empirically-established pragmatic information, explanatory information on L2 norms, and self-evaluation of pragmatic uses. Deductive analysis of 18 learners' reflective journaling demonstrated the range of pragmatic awareness gained through the use of these materials, and revealed that the instruction enhanced pragmatic awareness of different pragmatic aspects by varying degrees.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/subjectivity-second-foreign-language-pragmatic/docview/305311592/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Miyao, Mari",2007,"Traces, Incrementality, and Predictive Mechanisms in L2 Japanese Sentence Processing","This thesis tests Clahsen and Felser’s (2006) Shallow Structure Hypothesis that second language (L2) learners’ linguistic representations computed during on-line comprehension lack structural details and are thus shallower than native speakers’ representations. Off-line and on-line experiments were conducted to examine the computation of detailed representations in the processing of scrambled wA-phrases in Japanese. The off-line results from high-intermediate to advanced English-speaking learners of Japanese showed native-like patterns in question-particle production and in the interpretation of the wA-phrases. By contrast, their on-line results showed no evidence that they computed detailed representations to process the wA-phrases.

"Kim, Jong-Won",2007,A comparative study of the effects of explicit-inductive/cooperative instruction versus explicit-deductive/individualistic instruction on the second language acquisition of English relative clauses in Korean university-level EFL learners,"The problem . The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there would be a significant difference between an explicit-inductive/cooperative instruction and an explicit-deductive/individualistic instruction for the acquisition of English relative clauses in Korean university-level EFL learners. Method . This study used a mixed method design of data collection and analysis. The subject pool consisted of 90 undergraduate EFL students at Cheongju University, Korea. Two intact classes of 45 students each were randomly assigned to one of the treatments. Both groups received instruction about English relative clauses using the explicit-inductive/cooperative approach (experimental group), or the explicit-deductive/individualistic approach (control group). Students were administered a pretest, a posttest, and a delayed posttest with two sections: a Sentence Combining Test (SCT) and a Grammaticality Judgment Test (GJT). T-tests of dependent and independent samples were carried out to test for significant within groups and across group differences. To provide more reliability and validity for the results of quantitative data analysis, the results of the qualitative data analysis were triangulated with the quantitative results. Results . Both groups significantly increased their overall learning outcomes from the pretest to the posttest, but the experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group. Therefore, the explicit-inductive/cooperative instruction was more effective than the explicit-deductive/individualistic instruction. Also, both groups consistently scored higher on the SCT than on the GJT, but the experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group on both the SCT and the GJT. The rank order of mastery over four types of English relative clauses was OS &gt; OO &gt; SS &gt; SO, and the rank order of mastery over four types of common errors of English relative clauses was pronoun retention &gt; incorrect relative-marker morphology &gt; inappropriate relative-marker omission &gt; nonadjacency. EFL learners reported that they preferred cooperative learning over the explicit-inductive, discovery grammar activities. However, both the explicit-inductive, discovery grammar activities and cooperative learning were positively rated. Six key themes were found regarding EFL learners' perceptions of explicit-inductive, discovery grammar activities: (1)&#xa0;learner-centeredness; (2)&#xa0;complete understanding of the concepts; (3)&#xa0;positive attitudes towards L2 grammar learning; (4)&#xa0;creative thinking; (5)&#xa0;neutrality toward the explicit-inductive, discovery grammar activities; and (6)&#xa0;preference for the traditional explicit-deductive grammar activities. Seven key themes were found regarding their perceptions of cooperative learning: (1)&#xa0;Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) through more communication and interaction; (2)&#xa0;interdependence through more opportunities to answer questions; (3)&#xa0;more comfortable, safer, and less competitive learning environment; (4)&#xa0;active and independent learners; (5)&#xa0;learner-centeredness, (6)&#xa0;neutrality toward cooperative learning; and (7)&#xa0;preference for individualistic learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comparative-study-effects-explicit-inductive/docview/304701905/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Akai, Sawako",2007,Enhancing teaching and learning speech acts: Action research of Japanese as a foreign language,"This action research observes a second year Japanese class at a university where foreign language courses are elective for undergraduate students. In this study, using the six strategies to teach Japanese speech acts that Ishihara and Cohen (2006) suggested, I conducted three classes and analyzed my teaching practice with a critical friend. These strategies assist learners toward the development of their understanding of the following Japanese speech acts and also keep the learners to use them in a manner appropriate to the context: (1)&#xa0;invitation and refusal; (2)&#xa0;compliments; and (3)&#xa0;asking for a permission. The aim of this research is not only to improve my instruction in relation to second language (L2) pragmatic development, but also to raise further questions and to develop future research. The findings are analyzed and the data derived from my journals, artifacts, students' work, observation sheets, interviews with my critical friend, and pretests and posttests are coded and presented. The analysis shows that (1)&#xa0;after my critical friend encouraged my study and my students gave me some positive comments after each lesson, I gained confidence in teaching the suggested speech acts; (2)&#xa0;teaching involved explaining concepts and strategies, creating the visual material (a video) showing the strategies, and explaining the relationship between the strategy and grammatical forms and samples of misusing the forms; (3)&#xa0;students' background and learning styles influenced lessons; and (4)&#xa0;pretest and posttests showed that the students' level of their L2 appropriate pragmatics dramatically improved after each instruction. However, after careful observation, it was noted that some factors prevented students from producing the correct output even though they understood the speech act differences.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/enhancing-teaching-learning-speech-acts-action/docview/304705803/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kim, Hee Kyoung",2007,The role of the learner subjectivity and pragmatic transfer in the performance of requests by Korean ESL learners,"Based on a cross-cultural comparison of requesting behavior between Koreans and Americans, the study tried to determine the extent of pragmatic transfer and the impact of individual subjective motives that may influence pragmatic language choice. Two different groups of subjects participated in this study: 30 Korean participants for Korean (KK) and also for interlanguage (KE) data who were studying English as a Second Language (ESL) in a U.S. university, and 30 American college students (AE). Data were collected by using a questionnaire with a Discourse Completion Task (DCT). Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with 13 Korean ESL learners who showed the highest and the least amount of pragmatic transfer. Findings showed evidence of pragmatic transfer in the request responses given by Korean ESL learners in the level of directness, perspectives of head acts, and the frequency of supportive moves and internal modifiers. The requesting behaviors of KE group were realized through more direct strategies than those of AE group. KE speakers had a tendency to use hearer-oriented requests more frequently than AE speakers, but slightly less than KK speakers, indicating that L1 transfer is operative. Pragmatic transfer occurred in three supportive moves such as Promise of Reward, Appreciation, and Apology and in three internal modifiers such as play-down, consultative device, and downtoner. The interviewees in this study were conscious of differing rules for requesting. Learners’ judgment of L2 pragmatic norms, the learners’ perception of their own language and their attitudes of the learned language have a determining influence on language use. Furthermore, findings showed that purpose of learning the L2, learners’ different types of motivation, and the length of residence intention contribute to the extent of pragmatic transfer. Finally, impossibility to acquire native-like proficiency, fear of disloyalty to their own culture, and preference of L1 styles as a marker of cultural identity seemed to be factors that influence learners’ pragmatic choices. Findings of this study offer implications that language educators need to recognize and plan for the different target goals language learners may have and that second/foreign language speakers also possess a desire to express their own identity.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-learner-subjectivity-pragmatic-transfer/docview/304728982/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Yabuki-Soh, Noriko",2007,Investigating the role of form -focused instruction in Japanese as a foreign language classrooms: A study of relative clause acquisition,"This quasi-experimental study explored the role of form-focused instruction (FFI) on the acquisition of Japanese relative clauses. I investigated (a)&#xa0;the differential effects of three types of form-focused treatment (i.e., form-based, meaning-based, and form- plus meaning-based) on the learning of Japanese relativization, and (b)&#xa0;the participants' ability to generalize different types of relative clauses, examined in comparison with the predictions of the Noun Phrase Accessibility Hypothesis (NPAH) proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977). The study involved 60 young adult Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) learners in three classes at the introductory level in a university Japanese course, each class being provided with one of the three types of FFI. The target feature of the treatment sessions was the '""oblique"" relative clause that is considered to be a marked type in the NPAH, and I examined whether formal instruction that focused on a marked type could facilitate the learning of other relative clause types. Results of comprehension and sentence-combination pretests and posttests showed that although the scores of all three groups increased, the form-based treatment group outperformed the other two on both tests. While the comprehension pretest results did not reflect the predictions of the NPAH, participants were able to generalize rules for other relativization types. This study suggests that in this context, adult second language (L2) learners' attention to detailed analysis of form facilitates the comprehension and production of relative clauses, and that the teaching of marked items may inform effective syllabus development in relativization for adult JFL and, potentially, other L2 classes.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigating-role-form-focused-instruction/docview/304750582/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lu, Xuehong",2007,Motivational orientations in Chinese learning—Heritage and non-heritage college students in the United States,"This is a study of educational motivation for Chinese language acquisition in the higher learning context. To study the effect of motivation on language learning and learning outcomes of a Mandarin Chinese language learner, I measured integrative motivation, instrumental motivation, and a learner's attitudinal motivation, i.e. the orientation of attitude toward the language learning situations and examined how each influences Chinese language learning and a learner's learning outcomes. Given the heterogeneous nature of the Chinese language learners in the United States college classrooms, I divided the learners into two major classes: Chinese heritage language learners (HLLs), and Non-heritage learners (NHLLs). However, given the significant differences among NHLLs, in my analyses I further divided the NHLLs into two sub-groups: Eastern Asian non-heritage language learners, and Other non-heritage language learners. Students studied in this dissertation were registered in Chinese classes at the State University of New York at Buffalo. They were asked to complete a questionnaire that assesses (a)&#xa0;their integrative and instrumental orientations for learning Chinese, and (b)&#xa0;their attitudes toward the learning situations such as instructor/course specifics, group/peer specifics, and environment specifics—such as their attitudes toward a mixed classroom setting of heritage language learners (HLLs) and non-heritage language learners (NHLLs). Enrollments in Chinese language classes have been increasing across the United States. In most college Chinese language classes HLLs and NHLL are mixed. This study contributes to the literature on teaching and learning Chinese, and to the literature regarding internationalizing American higher education. It will help to improve Chinese language curriculums and programs at the higher education level in the United States, especially in the following aspects: (1)&#xa0;establishing connections between various motivations and academic learning outcomes for heritage language learners (HLLs) in comparison with non-heritage language learners (NHLLs), and (2)&#xa0;finding out the effects of learners' attitudes toward a mixed classroom learning environment in relation to their language learning and language learning outcomes for various heritage groups. In addition, the results gained from this comparative study should help to persuade higher education administrators and government policy makers that HLLs and NHLLs require separate classrooms, subsidiary materials, support organizations and specially trained language professionals that are capable of meeting their specific educational demands.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/motivational-orientations-chinese-learning/docview/304775303/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Navarro Ortega, Samuel A.",2007,The acquisition of motion event descriptions in L2 Spanish,"The present study is a cross-sectional investigation into the acquisition of the conceptual framework underlying the description of motion events in Spanish. Motion is a category of human cognition which is expressed differently in English and in Spanish, making motion an interesting area of investigation in a study of the acquisition of Spanish by English speakers. While English speakers tend to use manner verbs in sentences for specific descriptions of motion (e.g., run ), Spanish speakers tend to use path verbs in sentences for less specific descriptions of motion (e.g., go ). The participants for this study were sixty English speakers studying Spanish at three levels of proficiency (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and a group of twenty native speakers of Spanish. The English speakers were tested for their preferences in written motion descriptions in Spanish and English (the receptive task). They were also tested for their use of motion verbs in spontaneous connected speech (the production task), also in Spanish and English. Results showed that, in the receptive task, all English-speaking learners chose higher percentages of manner than path descriptions in English, but only the advanced learners showed a preference for higher percentages of path descriptions in Spanish compared with manner descriptions. In the production task, all learners talked about motion using higher percentages of path verbs. However, highest token frequencies revealed important differences in the way learners talked about motion in Spanish. For example, the advanced learners, like the Spanish native speakers, favoured an exiting-going-returning verb sequence. By contrast, the beginner and intermediate learners produced a more English-like verb sequence of going-coming , without any reference to motion in relation to a bounded area. The study demonstrated that the acquisition of motion event descriptions was a slow process in which the beginners as well as the intermediate learners relied on first-language knowledge in the receptive and production tasks in Spanish, their second language. It was only after extensive exposure to the second language, higher levels of proficiency, and numerous instances of thinking and speaking in Spanish that the advanced learners conceptualized and expressed motion in ways which resembled more the target-language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-motion-event-descriptions-l2-spanish/docview/304791027/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shin, Chang Won",2007,"Korean EFL learners' knowledge of semantic, morphological, and syntactic properties of English verbs: The relationships of lexical and grammatical knowledge","The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between lexical and grammatical knowledge in the L2 acquisition of English by Korean EFL learners by examining how the depth of lexical knowledge that Korean learners have about English verbs is related to their grammatical knowledge. For this study, L2 research into depth of lexical knowledge and generative syntactic theory have been reviewed to suggest the interdependent nature of vocabulary and grammar in L2 acquisition (Nation, 1990, 2001; Chomsky, 1981, 1986, 1995; Herschensohn, 2000). Data were collected from Korean EFL learners through a depth of vocabulary knowledge test which focused on semantic, morphological, and syntactic properties of English verbs and a grammar test. The results showed that there was a high positive correlation between vocabulary and grammar knowledge in L2 English acquisition by Korean learners, and that semantic, morphological, and syntactic properties of lexical knowledge all contributed to the prediction of L2 learners' grammatical knowledge. In particular, the syntactic property of lexical knowledge was found to be the most important predictor of grammatical knowledge. However, it was also found that the morphological property was not as important in the prediction of L2 grammatical knowledge as the syntactic property. Based on these findings, it was argued that the in-depth view of L2 lexical knowledge might be appropriate for explaining the interdependent nature of lexical and grammatical knowledge, since this in-depth perspective sees lexical knowledge as consisting of various properties such as semantic, morphological, and syntactic features. On the other hand, a generative view on syntax also seems to provide an account of how each property of lexical knowledge would be related to overall grammatical knowledge. Thus, the syntactic property of word knowledge such as argument structures and subcategorization frames might serve as a connector which links lexical and grammatical knowledge. Finally, some possible accounts of why the morphological property of vocabulary knowledge did not contribute as much to the prediction of L2 grammatical knowledge as the syntactic property were provided on the basis of the notion of argument structures, the characteristics of morphological knowledge assessed by the in-depth vocabulary test, and L2 lexical development model proposed by Jiang (2000).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/korean-efl-learners-knowledge-semantic/docview/304811073/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Czeczulin, Annalisa Olivia",2007,The Russian reflexive in second -language acquisition: Binding preferences and L1 transfer,"This dissertation investigates knowledge of reflexives by adult English-speaking learners of Russian as a second language. The study uses an experimental methodology to ascertain the extent to which a speaker’s native language (L1) influences his or her acquisition of the second language (L2). The thesis concerns L2 acquisition of the reflexive object pronoun sebja, the reflexive possessive pronoun svoj, and the post-verbal affix -sja and investigates the claim that unlike in English, in Russian some anaphors may be bound long-distance (LD) outside non-finite embedded clauses. Twenty non-native and ten native speakers of Russian were tested during the first experiment, and ten non-native and ten native speakers during the second experiment. The experiments were based on Bennett and Progovac (1993) and White et al. (1997). The first experiment found that the more proficient the L2 speakers become, the more their binding pattern reflects that of the L1 informants, suggesting that the L2 subjects depend on their L1 parameters and settings to bind in the L2, but that this dependence wanes as they become more proficient. L2 learners of Russian maintain their L1 AGR parameter in the L2, but transfer their L1 X max binding type at first. Following training, L2 subjects showed greater sensitivity to ambiguity of reference for sebja than native Russian speakers or overgeneralized the training. Although no resetting of parameters was observed during the research, the possibility of resetting parameters looks promising. This resetting will vary across reflexive and sentence types. The second experiment, which evaluated the effects of preferences and pragmatics on binding, suggests that two grammars exist in Russian speakers and that language change may be underway in Russian where LD anaphora are concerned. The L2 subjects were less successful in this experiment and violated the c-command requirement for reflexives. LD binding could be induced through introduction of a verb of power in combination with a LD antecedent deemed to have control over the local antecedent. The experiment’s results conclude that Bennett and Progovac’s (1993) X 0 /X max addition to Chomsky’s Binding Theory does not adequately explain the current binding situation in Russian.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/russian-reflexive-second-language-acquisition/docview/304821399/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Sawasaki, Koichi",2007,L2 reading by learners of Japanese: A comparison of different L1s,"This study investigates the processing strategies learners of Japanese employ while reading Japanese. Language researchers theorize that native speakers process sentences incrementally. However, little is known about processing in a second language when the first and second languages are typologically different. For example, English and Chinese take an SVO word order with little or no overt Case marking while Japanese and Korean take an SOV word order with overt Case marking. In SVO languages, verb information may provide upcoming postverbal information, and in SOV languages, preverbal information (Case information) may provide upcoming information for argument and verb. Based on these assumptions, this study examines how groups of Japanese language learners process sentences in reading when their first languages are English, Chinese, or Korean. Of special interest is whether learners process arguments and adjuncts differently before reaching a verb. Equally, of another piece of interest is how each learner group reads each phrase of a sentence. Experiments with self-paced reading tasks were conducted with two intermediate and one advanced Japanese level of English groups, an advanced Japanese level of Chinese group, an advanced Japanese level of Korean group, and a control group (native speakers of Japanese). Results of the experiments revealed that advanced learners as well as the control group showed some sensitivity to the arguments/adjuncts differentiation. English-speaking intermediate groups failed to demonstrate the distinction, but all learner groups provided some indication that they tried to employ incremental processing in a way that seemed most appropriate for their ability level. When reading times at each phrase are examined, advanced learner groups (English L1, Chinese L1, and Korean L1) showed similar reading patterns regardless of their L1s, but groups of a different proficiency level (native speakers, advanced learners, and intermediate learners) exhibited reading patterns distinctive to each group in terms of where the reading times were elevated. We argue that distinctive patterns occur because learners (especially those with lower proficiency) experience cognitive limitations due to lacking linguistic experiences and knowledge in the target language. From these results we argue that while learners and native speakers may differ in how they utilize specific processing strategies to compensate for their cognitive limitations, both learners and native speakers share some fundamental features of processing, i.e., incremental processing while reading.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-reading-learners-japanese-comparison-different/docview/304822076/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kim, Hana",2007,The interpretation of English pronouns by native speakers of Korean,"This thesis investigated how Korean L2 speakers of English, whose L1 is a null argument language, interpret English pronouns, and how (or if) their L1 plays a role in the interpretation of English pronouns. Specifically, it examined whether Korean speakers of English have knowledge of Binding Principle B in the interpretation of English pronouns, and also whether they transfer their preferences for a discourse antecedent versus a matrix subject (sentence internal) antecedent from their L1 to English. As a pretest, the participants' knowledge in relation to subject and object omission in English was examined. The results showed that the Korean speakers of English, regardless of whether or not they knew that English is not a null argument language, knew that an English pronoun cannot be locally bound in its governing category. That is, the results indicated that their interpretation of pronouns in their English L2 was constrained by Binding Principle B. Furthermore, the results showed that they preferred a matrix subject antecedent to a discourse antecedent, similar to the native speakers of English. However, at the same time, they were more inclined to accept a discourse antecedent than were the native speakers of English. The results suggested that the Korean speakers of English were influenced to a certain extent by their L1 in their interpretation of English pronouns, while their L1 Korean did not cause problems to figure out non-local constraints for an English pronoun.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interpretation-english-pronouns-native-speakers/docview/304828760/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ananth, Priya",2007,Acquisition of Tense and Aspect in <em>Toki </em>'When' Clauses in Japanese as a Second /Foreign Language,"This study examined the acquisition of tense-aspect in toki ‘when’ clauses in Japanese among adult learners of Japanese as a second or foreign language. The objective of the study was to investigate if native languages (Language Transfer Hypothesis) and/or inherent semantic characteristics of verbs (Aspect Hypothesis) play a role in the selection of the -ru/-ta endings in toki ‘when’ clauses. The experimental study was conducted with 37 participants in Experiment 1 (with Achievement verbs in the toki clause position) and 34 participants in Experiment 2 (with Accomplishment, Activity and Stative verbs in the toki clause position). The research instrument consisted of a written version of the Truth Value Judgment Task in which the participants were asked to judge whether a sentence written in Japanese matched the content of a story that preceded it. The experimental results suggest that the Language Transfer Hypothesis seems to be working independently for the Durative verbs (Experiment 2) category, while the Aspect Hypothesis seems to be independently working for the Achievement verbs (Experiment 1) category. That is, both these hypotheses seem to be working partially for the two categories of verbs (Achievements and Duratives). There were two sets of results obtained that were not predicted by the two hypotheses. The Language Transfer Hypothesis does not predict the good performances of the Chinese and English speakers for the S1 ru toki S2 ta pattern in the Durative category, while the Aspect Hypothesis does not predict the absence of over-use of - ta with Accomplishment verbs in the present study. The first unpredicted result can possibly be explained by offering another hypothesis, that learners are also sensitive to the durative semantic aspect (or lack thereof) of the verbs in question. That is, their choice of the -ru/-ta morpheme in toki clauses is also influenced by the issue of whether the verb in question represents an event that has a certain length of duration or if it occurs momentarily. For verbs that express a duration-like Accomplishment, Stativity or Activity, the learners associate the -ru with the duration of the verb and are able to select the morpheme correctly. As for the second result that deviated from the predictions, that Accomplishment verbs are not showing errors with over-use of -ta , it can be conjectured that learners are not focusing on the end-point of the Accomplishment verbs, and are treating them as Activity verbs with a finite duration. Thus, from this study it seems that besides telicity, another semantic feature, namely, the durative versus instantaneous character of the verb is also playing an important role in the choice of the -ru/-ta morphemes in toki clauses. These results have important pedagogical implications in that it may be useful to introduce the inherent semantic characteristics of the verbs such as durativity, telicity and punctuality in the Japanese language classroom and teaching materials. Since the learners seem to be naturally sensitive to these characteristics, introducing them in the classroom will assist them in their internal processing as well as production of the time expressions in Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-tense-aspect-em-toki-when-clauses/docview/304832688/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kang, Hyun-Sook",2007,"Negative evidence: Its positioning, explicitness and linguistic focus as factors in second language acquisition","This study investigated the role of negative evidence and its explicitness and positioning factors in second language acquisition. The explicitness factor was divided into explicit vs. implicit in light of the presence or absence of deductive, metalinguistic rule instruction during conversational interaction. The positioning factor was categorized into proactive vs. reactive. While the proactive condition provided negative evidence prior to the learner production of errors on the basis of the perceived gap in the interlanguage, the reactive condition presented negative evidence contingent on learners' erroneous utterances. Forty-five heritage learners of Korean at the post-secondary level participated in the study. The design of pretest - immediate posttest - delayed posttest composed of the grammaticality judgment test and oral picture description test was utilized, along with three experimental conditions and a control condition. One week after the administration of the pretest, the learners engaged in one of the following conditions: (1)&#xa0;explicit/proactive; (2)&#xa0;explicit/reactive; (3)&#xa0;implicit/reactive; and (4)&#xa0;provision of backchannels (control). During the instructional session, the learners were provided with the different types of negative evidence on the Korean past tense form. The posttest was conducted immediately following the instructional session and the delayed posttest took place four weeks after the instruction and posttest session. Analyses of the pretest and immediate posttest results showed that the three experimental groups outperformed the control group, which supports for the facilitative role of negative evidence in improving the knowledge of the Korean past tense form. It was revealed that the reactive provision of negative evidence was more effective than the proactive provision, which suggests that negative evidence immediately contingent on the learners' deviant form was successful in facilitating the learner knowledge of the target form. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the explicit vs. implicit negative evidence in facilitating the learners' knowledge of the target form, which supported for the potential of implicit provision of negative evidence without interrupting the flow of conversation. Theoretical and pedagogical implications of this empirical research, along with directions for future research, were addressed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/negative-evidence-positioning-explicitness/docview/304837800/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kawahara, Shigeto",2007,The emergence of phonetic naturalness,"This dissertation addresses whether synchronic phonology encodes phonetic naturalness. I argue that while phonological grammars allow phonetically unnatural patterns as a result of coincidental historical changes, they are nevertheless biased toward phonetic naturalness. The key observation revealed by experimentation is that phonetic naturalness emerges when speakers create novel phonological patterns. I refer to the observation as ""the emergence of phonetic naturalness"". To explain the emergence of phonetic naturalness, I propose within Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 2004) that the universal set of constraints is phonetically natural, and constraint rankings are also phonetically natural by default. To accommodate unnaturalness, individual languages can create unnatural constraints and reverse default constraint rankings. Chapter 1 lays out the issues and Chapter 2 develops a grammatical model. Chapter 3 discusses devoicing of voiced geminates in Japanese loanword phonology. Only voiced geminates, but not voiced singletons, can devoice to dissimilate from another voiced obstruent. I argue that the difference in neutralizability is grounded in a perceptibility scale related to the voicing contrast in singletons and geminates, but that the cause of devoicing, OCP(voice), is phonetically unnatural. Chapter 4 discusses a novel pattern of Japanese mimetic gemination. When speakers create emphatic forms, they prefer geminate stops the most, geminate fricatives next, and geminate nasals least. The preference hierarchy harmonically aligns with the perceptibility scale for singleton-geminate contrasts for different manners of consonants. Chapter 5 examines the distribution of vowels that are correspond with Ø in novel Japanese rap rhyming. The likelihood of vowels being treated as Ø directly correlates with their perceptual similarity to Ø. Chapter 6 shows that in rap rhyming the more perceptually similar two consonants are, the more likely they are to rhyme. The patterns studied in Chapter 5 and 6 show that phonetically natural patterns emergence in novel verbal art. The case studies suggest that when speakers create novel phonological patterns, they deploy phonetic knowledge, and hence phonetically natural patterns assert themselves.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/emergence-phonetic-naturalness/docview/304837884/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hwang, Hyekyung",2007,Prosodic phrasing in sentence comprehension: Evidence from native English speakers and native Korean -speaking second language learners of English,"This work investigates the perception and use of prosodic phrasing in the processing of spoken English sentences by English native speakers (L1ers) and Korean second language learners of English (L2ers). The prosodic structures of English and Korean differ in that English intermediate phrases (ips) have more variable tonal patterns and stronger durational cues than Korean accentual phrases, the Korean counterpart. However, the two languages show similar phonetic and phonological properties for intonation phrases (IPhs). Three on- and off-line sentence comprehension experiments test sentences containing a verb in an initial subordinate clause that could be intransitive or transitive, resulting in a temporary syntactic ambiguity between Early and Late Closure of the clause. The results provide new evidence for significant effects of both absolute and relative sizes of prosodic boundaries in establishing phrase structure, showing that both language groups make fine-grained prosodic distinctions during parsing. They support previous claims that parsing decisions are influenced by the overall prosodic representation and that there are separable effects of the two phonologically distinctive levels of prosodic phrasing. Despite a generally consistent role of prosodic structure in sentence processing, there are significant differences in the effects of ips between the two language groups. Intermediate prosodic boundaries provide markedly weaker evidence for syntactic boundaries for Korean L2ers than for English L1ers, but the L2ers performed similarly to the L1ers with IPh boundaries. A following discrimination experiment demonstrates that the differential effects of ips are not due to perceptual differences between L1ers and L2ers. I argue from these results that there exist universal underlying processing principles that govern the role of prosodic phrasing. The different prosodic effects seem likely to stem from categorizing a phonetic pattern as an ip or forming prosody-syntax mappings, which sheds light on the Korean L2ers' developmental stage in perceiving and processing English prosody. Taken together, this dissertation contributes to the L2 literature, in which little is known with respect to the acquisition of prosody and the role of prosody in processing. It also provides further insights for L1 processing by discriminating among hypotheses for the use of prosody in sentence comprehension.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/prosodic-phrasing-sentence-comprehension-evidence/docview/304846867/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hasegawa, Tomomi",2007,The Critical Period Hypothesis in very early child L2 acquisition of Japanese: The uninevitability of native -like attainment,"Nobody would doubt that young children have a better chance than adults to become native-like in second language (L2) acquisition. Such a claim is commonly found in work framed by the Critical Period Hypothesis (Lenneberg, 1967), and many age-related L2 empirical studies confirm the adage ""the younger the better."" Nevertheless, very little research has investigated whether truly native-like attainment is inevitable when a child is exposed to sustained target language input from very early childhood. This dissertation aims to demonstrate that some seemingly native-like child L2 learners (L2ers), schooled in the target language for years, are indeed not native-like when engaging in linguistically challenging tasks. In this study, such tasks were created with aural comprehension and oral production of various types of Japanese relative clauses (RCs). Since in Japanese, knowledge of case marking is a prerequisite of knowledge of RCs, two inclusion criteria were applied: (a)&#xa0;at least 80% accuracy on nominative and accusative case marking (in a comprehension task); (b)&#xa0;a native-like conversational proficiency rating (based on a picture-narration task). Of the more than 70 naturalistic child L2ers of Japanese who originally participated, 38 passed (age of onset: 0-7; age at testing: 10 or older). In the main analyses, the RC comprehension and production scores of these 38 child L2ers were compared with age-matched native speakers ( n = 17). Group mean comparisons indicated no significant differences between the two groups; however, the child L2 group exhibited substantial within-group variation. Occasionally, some child L2ers, despite ostensible knowledge of Japanese RCs (based on their overall RC comprehension scores), supplied ungrammatical responses in RC production and/or misapplied an RC comprehension strategy from their native language, both of which indicate that these child L2ers are qualitatively different from their native-speaking peers. The findings suggest that there are indeed some child L2ers who are not truly native-like despite their native-like conversational proficiency, and thus that native-like attainment is not inevitable even when L2ers receive sustained target language input from very early on in life. Other issues discussed include the nature of bilingual acquisition, the difference between knowledge and performance, and pedagogical implications.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/critical-period-hypothesis-very-early-child-l2/docview/304846911/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zimmerman, Erica Lea",2007,Identity constructions of users of Japanese: Interculturality in talk,"Utilizing an applied Conversation Analysis approach, this study examines how identity and interculturality are constructed in talk by participants who are Korean learners of Japanese at a university in Japan. The analysis of audio recordings of naturally occurring conversations reveals that the participants, on occasion, orient to intercultural statuses in talk in two contexts: (1)&#xa0;narrating experiences and (2)&#xa0;talk about language. The findings indicate that in these data, there were three possible combinations for indicating one's interculturality in talk. First, in some examples, participants indicated their intercultural and ethnic memberships and worked to arrive at some sort of understanding about each other's culture. Second, some interactions demonstrated that participants may orient to intercultural topics of talk and arrive at a shared understanding without making their own ethnic membership categorization relevant for that bit of talk. Finally, the participants may mention their ethnic and linguistic membership categorizations and affiliations as a part of the point-making process of their talk, but the talk is not about arriving at a greater intercultural understanding. This study reveals that interculturality is not found in special moments in the participants' lives, rather, these moments permeate everyday interactions. The participants make use of the interactional resources to construct interculturality when it is the most efficient and appropriate method to manage their world—they do not orient to interculturality simply because they are from a certain culture or ethnicity, as has been explained in research examining so called non-native speakers or learners of Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/identity-constructions-users-japanese/docview/304847068/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lin, Grace Huey-Yuh",2007,The impact of acculturation on the primary language maintenance of second generation Chinese American immigrants,"This study explores how the socialization experiences of second generation Chinese American immigrants support and encourage them to maintain their primary language, culture, and ethnic identity in their environment during the process of acculturation. This study examines why second generation Chinese American immigrants continue to strive for maintenance of their primary language. Particularly, the study investigates the factors that influence the primary language maintenance and bilingual development, how the immigrant parents contribute to the primary language maintenance in their living context, how second generation Chinese American immigrants adapt to the mainstream educational institutions and the larger society while maintaining their primary language, culture, and ethnic identity. A phenomenological research approach advocated by Polkinghorne (1989) and Moustakas (1994) was employed in this study to describe and interpret the meaning in the personal lived experiences of Chinese American participants who emigrated with their parents to the U.S. at young age. The phenomenological approach called for the words of the participants to provide a window into finding new meanings of bilingual and bicultural development and adjustment in the context of second generation Chinese American immigrants' lived experiences. The data were collected through one-one-one lengthy, in depth, semi-structured interviews with each selected participants to explore and describe the meaning for the individuals who had experienced the phenomenon. Among those participating were three second generation Chinese American immigrants and three immigrant parents. The findings from the interview revealed that when the participant immigrants started entering the mainstream educational systems, they did not realize that it was valuable to continue studying their primary language and retaining their cultural heritage because of the assimilative power from the mainstream educational institutions and the larger society. Since their childhood, their parents, particularly their mothers, took a responsibility to pass on and seek any means to maintain fluency in their primary language. Over time, they all now had great appreciation for their parents, the teachers from the mainstream schools, the teachers from the weekend Chinese schools, and the people from the community that taught, supported, and encouraged them to retain their bilingual and bicultural competences when they grew up in the host country. What emerged from the interviews were their positive attitudes toward the mainstream educational institutions and the larger society which provided them with opportunities (Ogbu, 1985, 1991). They strived to accommodate themselves to the demands from the mainstream educational systems and achieve the academic competences in the dominant society without assimilating and giving up their primary language, culture, and identification within the Chinese ethnic groups (Belden, 1997; Gibson, 1988). In addition, they consciously developed their own unique ethnic identities and considered they could function well in two cultures depending on the situation.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/impact-acculturation-on-primary-language/docview/304851880/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Goro, Takuya",2007,Language -specific constraints on scope interpretation in first language acquisition,"This dissertation investigates the acquisition of language-specific constraints on scope interpretation by Japanese preschool children. Several constructions in Japanese do not allow scope interpretations that the corresponding English sentences do allow. First, in Japanese transitive sentences with multiple quantificational arguments, an inverse scope interpretation is disallowed, due to the Rigid Scope Constraint. Second, Japanese logical connectives cannot be interpreted under the scope of local negation, due to their Positive Polarity. Thirdly, in Japanese infinitival complement constructions with implicative matrix verbs like wasureru (""forget"") the inverse scope interpretation is required, due to the Anti-Reconstruction Constraint. The main goal of this research is to determine how Japanese children learn these constraints on scope interpretations. To that end, three properties of the acquisition task that have an influence on the learnability of linguistic knowledge are examined: productivity, no negative evidence, and arbitrariness. The results of experimental investigations show that Japanese children productively generate scope interpretations that are never exemplified in the input. For example, with sentences that contain two quantificational arguments, Japanese children accessed inverse scope interpretations that Japanese adults do not allow. Also, Japanese children interpret the disjunction ka under the scope of local negation, which is not a possible interpretive option in the adult language. These findings clearly show that children do not acquire these scope constraints through conservative learning, and raise the question of how they learn to purge their non-adult interpretations. It is argued that input data do not provide learners with negative evidence (direct or indirect) against particular scope interpretations. Two inherent properties of input data about possible scope interpretations, data sparseness and indirectness, make negative evidence too unreliable as a basis for discovering what scope interpretation is impossible. In order to solve the learnability problems that children's scope productivity raise, I suggest that the impossibility of their non-adult interpretations are acquired by learning some independently observable properties of the language. In other words, the scope constraints are not arbitrary in the sense that their effects are consequences of other properties of the grammar of Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/language-specific-constraints-on-scope/docview/304852925/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tada, Masao",2005,Assessment of EFL pragmatic production and perception using video prompts,"This study describes an investigation of the development of EFL learners' pragmatic production and perception of the speech acts of requests, refusals, and apologies using video prompts, which were part of a computerized data collection instrument. These three face-threatening acts were chosen because of their importance and difficulty for non-native speakers of English. Forty-eight Japanese learners of English took part in this study. The results showed that pragmatic production develops hand in hand with overall English proficiency to some extent, whereas pragmatic perception is relatively independent of proficiency. This trend was consistent across the three speech acts, across two imposition levels, as well as in a variety of situations. A correlation analysis suggested that the learners' production and perception may be dependent upon different speech acts. Among possible explanations for the phenomena were the learners' linguistic constraints, the transfer of L1 pragmatic knowledge, and the learners' beliefs about L2 pragmatic rules. Neither production nor perception had developed fully from the perspective of the native speaker judges, probably because of the paucity of input containing these speech acts in the Japanese EFL context. These results suggest that EFL learners need opportunities to receive input containing English speech acts and to practice both perceiving and producing speech acts in order to be pragmatically competent in L2 English. The low level of pragmatic development also suggested that the inclusion of lower proficiency learners is important when investigating EFL learners' pragmatic abilities. In terms of the research methodology, the use of the video-prompted computerized procedure and the use of oral data proved to be useful. In a supplementary analysis of the construct validity of the instruments with 107 Japanese learners of English, a principal component analysis showed that while the context-internal parameters for apologies and requests showed a one component solution, which supported previous research findings, the context-internal parameters for refusals appeared to be made up of two different constructs: the speaker-related component and the recipient-related component. In sum, this study addresses several important issues in the investigation of learners' speech acts, and issues in the teaching of pragmatic competence in EFL contexts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/assessment-efl-pragmatic-production-perception/docview/305448399/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Park, Kyae-Sung",2005,L2 acquisition of English unaccusative verbs by native speakers of Korean,"This experimental study explores the learnability problems involved in the acquisition of English unaccusative verbs by Korean L2 learners using a production and two grammaticality judgment tasks. The results showed that learners tended to overpassivize unaccusatives. Due to the poor performance on resultatives and pseudopassives with unergatives, it was found that very few could make the unergative/unaccusative distinction. On the other hand, learners correctly performed on those with unaccusatives, which suggests that they had knowledge of syntactic properties of unaccusativity at D-Structure. Overpassivization errors indicate that L1 transfer occurred at the morphological level, and that learners had an innate knowledge in mapping semantic roles onto syntactic functions. That is, they relied on the canonical mapping, agent to subject and theme to object. In conclusion, although L1 plays a crucial role in the L2 acquisition of English unaccusative verbs by native speakers of Korean, a UG-related mechanism is also involved.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-acquisition-english-unaccusative-verbs-native/docview/305427591/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nguyen, Minh Thi Thuy",2005,Criticizing and responding to criticism in a foreign language: A study of Vietnamese learners of English,"Interlanguage pragmatics research has contributed a great deal to our understanding of L2 pragmatic use but less to our understanding of L2 pragmatic development, although developmental issues are also its primary research goal. Additionally, previous studies have been confined to a rather small set of speech acts, under-researching such face-damaging acts as criticizing and responding to criticism even though these may be more challenging for L2 learners. The present study examines pragmatic development in the use of criticizing and responding to criticism by a group of Vietnamese EFL learners with a view to shedding light on the pragmatic properties of these speech acts. IL data were collected from 12 high beginners, 12 intermediate learners, and 12 advanced learners, via a written questionnaire and role play, and analyzed with reference to L1 and L2 baseline data collected from 12 Vietnamese and 12 Australian NSs via the same methods. Metapragmatic data were collected via retrospective interview. Four main findings are discussed. Firstly, the learners criticized and responded to criticism very differently from the NSs. This difference might have adversely affected how the learners negotiated their intentions expressed via speech act realizations. Secondly, there was little evidence of any proficiency effect on the learners' use of these two speech acts. This was probably because pragmatic development was limited by the EFL context, as the learners had had insufficient exposure to the target norms. Thirdly, there was evidence of pragmatic transfer in the learners' production. This transfer was affected by the learners' perception of L1-L2 proximity and assumption of L2 reasonableness. Finally, the retrospective interviews with learners suggested four main sources of influence on their pragmatic decision-making: insufficient L2 pragmatic knowledge, transfer of communication and learning, processing difficulty, and learning experience. The present study lends support to a number of SLA theories, including Bialystoks' processing model and Meisel et al. 's complexification hypothesis. It found that the major challenge for learners in L2 pragmatic acquisition is to gain control over processing. It also found an acquisitional order of modality markers which was dependent upon their structural complexity and the processing demands involved in producing them.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/criticizing-responding-criticism-foreign-language/docview/305392196/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Alnofal, Abdulaziz I.

(b)&#xa0;What are the writing strategies they apply when writing in L2? (c)&#xa0;What are the similarities or differences between the writing processes they apply when writing in L1 and in L2? (d)&#xa0;What are the similarities or differences between the writing processes male and female participants apply when writing in L1 and in L2? The population of this study includes 161 male and 42 female Saudi undergraduate ESL students attending American universities. The data used in this study was obtained using two methodologies: quantitative and qualitative. First, the quantitative data were collected via an online survey. Second, and based on the participants' scores on Rose's Writer's Block test, stimulated recall interviews (SRls) were conducted with six participants, three of whom were characterized as blocked in L1 but not in L2, and three of whom were characterized as blocked in L2 but not in L1. The SRIs required each participant to write about a descriptive topic in L1 and another in L2, independently. The results of this study indicated several things: there were differences between L1 and L2 in the training received and in the pre-writing and post-writing processes applied; there were similarities in the while-writing processes in both languages; there were relationships between the L1 and L2 writing processes; there were no significant differences between the writing processes of males and females in L1 and L2.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/arabic-first-language-writing-english-second/docview/305317459/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Wade, Travis William",2003,Acoustic variability and perceptual learning of nonnative -accented speech sounds,"The present study seeks to answer the questions of whether and how listeners may come to recognize nonnative-accented speech sounds as a result of formal training, and what impact the acoustic variability of non-native productions has on their learnability, in order to address the larger issue of how humans deal with unpredictability in the instantiations of categories during perceptual learning. In a high-variability, identification-with-feedback training study, it was observed that subjects do not respond to this type of training on accented words in the same way that they have been previously shown to with native-produced words. Trainees demonstrated adaptation to individual Spanish-accented speakers they encountered during training but showed no recognition advantages that were transferable to productions of other Spanish-accented speakers. An acoustic study comparing the accented vowel sounds included in the training study with a parallel set of native-produced sounds revealed a robust increase in variability in nonnatives' use of the perceptual vowel space, involving larger, less regular distributions and greater category overlap. In an additional training study where types and degree of variability in the use of vowel space were controlled artificially, subjects exposed to words with vowel distributions defined by variability typical of that observed in non-native productions did not improve in recognition accuracy over the course of learning as subjects exposed to lower levels of variability did. Post-training recognition of highly-varied sounds was not effected overall by the level of variability of training, though differences were observed in subjects' sensitivity to certain individual vowels. Results are discussed with respect to an exemplar model of perceptual learning, which it is suggested does not entirely account for the perception of accented speech.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acoustic-variability-perceptual-learning/docview/305318348/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nakamura, Michiko",2003,Processing of multiple filler -gap dependencies in Japanese,"Numerous studies have shown that in head-initial languages such as English, French, and German, relative clauses with a gap in the subject position (subject-gap relative clauses) are easier to process than relative clauses with a gap in the object position (object-gap relative clauses). One memory-based explanation for this subject-object gap asymmetry has been linear distance: a subject gap is linearly closer to the filler than an object gap, and thus fewer words need to be processed between the gap and its filler. This dissertation investigates the subject-object gap asymmetry in the processing of relative clauses in Japanese, a head-final language in which a relative clause precedes its head noun. In Japanese, an object gap is linearly closer than a subject gap to the filler. Therefore, the linear distance model predicts that object-gap relative clauses should be easier to process than subject-gap relative clauses. The results of two self-paced reading experiments showed that native speakers of Japanese found subject-gap relative clauses easier to process than object-gap relative clauses. At the head noun, this effect was modulated by the grammatical relation of the head noun. In following regions, however, the interaction disappeared and a consistent subject gap advantage emerged. A gap asymmetry was also found in relative clauses with two filler-gap dependencies. This construction involves global structural ambiguity in the dependencies between gaps and fillers. When semantic/pragmatic information strongly constrained the plausible thematic roles of fillers, the results of an offline survey and two self-paced reading experiments revealed a clear subject-object asymmetry: the distant filler was preferably associated with a subject gap over an object gap. When semantic/pragmatic information was weaker, processing became extremely difficult and showed no gap asymmetry. These findings are inconsistent with a linear distance account. It is proposed that the asymmetry is better accounted for by the structural distance between gap and filler: a subject gap is structurally closer to the filler, and thus it is computationally easier to form a dependency with. Structural distance as an alternative to account for both Japanese findings and the role of pragmatic information during processing is discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-multiple-filler-gap-dependencies/docview/305326389/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nakahama, Yuko",2003,Cross -linguistic influence on the development of referential topic management in L2 Japanese oral narratives,"Within the framework of a functional approach to an understanding of language development (e.g. Givón, 1995; Klein, 1990; Tomlin, 1990), this study investigates cross-linguistic influence (CLI) on the management of referential topics in oral narratives of Japanese as a second language (L2). In order to examine how language distance plays a role in the L2 learning processes, discourse produced by two groups of learners of Japanese, one whose first language (L1) is typologically similar to and one whose L1 is distant from Japanese (Korean and English, correspondingly) was investigated. Furthermore, discourse produced at three different proficiency levels for each L1 was compared in order to examine potentially differing developmental patterns due to the learners' L1. Given the major role played by referents in manifesting topic continuity and discontinuity in discourse, the ways in which referents get introduced and maintained as topics were examined. Specifically, postpositional markers, zero anaphora, and the passive constructions were analyzed. The study revealed differing patterns in the acquisition of the management of referential topics between the Korean and English L1 groups. Previously unanswered issues regarding CLI within the field of SLA were addressed as follows: (1)&#xa0;Different acquisitional patterns between Korean and English learners were observed in the performance of some postpositional markers and in the morphological changes (passivization) of verbs. This offered new insights in CLI because interlanguage grammar has been considered to be an area of language in which CLI is rarely observed. Furthermore, different forms generated different ways in which CLI (both negative and positive transfer) was realized in the learner language. (2)&#xa0;Detailed qualitative analysis demonstrated how both NS and NNS manipulate form-function mapping while telling a story, and the form-function mapping skills developed with proficiency in the learner discourse. (3)&#xa0;Finally, the study expands upon the previous notion of conceptual transfer which was claimed to be found mainly on the level of lexicon or pragmatic realization. The current study identified conceptual transfer in the discourse-grammar interface. This part of the results reveals that the manner in which speakers ‘think for speaking’ (Slobin, 1991) in their L1 transferred to their L2 discourse.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/cross-linguistic-influence-on-development/docview/305329390/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Marinova-Todd, Stefka H.",2003,Comprehensive analysis of ultimate attainment in adult second language acquisition,"This dissertation consists of three articles examining, both theoretically and empirically, the ultimate attainment of post-pubescent second language learners. The first article is a comprehensive review of the literature on the ultimate attainment in adult second language (L2) acquisition. Growing research evidence shows that there are some adult learners who achieve native-like proficiency in their L2 and emphasizes the necessity to study these learners in greater detail than has traditionally been done. Based on the research reviewed, several areas of study are identified that still need to be addressed by empirical research. Therefore, the second article discusses an empirical study that examined the linguistic performance of highly proficient adult L2 learners across major domains of language knowledge (e.g., pronunciation, vocabulary size, grammar and language use) and compared their performance to that of a control group of native speakers of English. Results from a multivariate analysis of variance indicate that on measures of pronunciation, vocabulary size and grammar knowledge, the group of L2 learners performed significantly worse than the group of native speakers. However, analyses of the individual performance of the L2 learners on the different tasks revealed that at least 40% of them performed within the native range. In addition, three profiles of the highly proficient learners are discussed in greater detail revealing that some of them achieve native-like proficiency across all the domains of L2 knowledge under examination. The final article isolates some background factors (e.g., age of arrival and length of residence in the L2 setting, amount of formal L2 study, intensity of L2 input, level of formal education and degree of motivation to achieve high levels of proficiency in the L2) that are associated with the L2 learners' proficiency in the different L2 domains. This analysis concluded that current experiential factors, such as use of English and its importance to the learner, best predicted the ultimate attainment in this group of highly proficient adult L2 learners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comprehensive-analysis-ultimate-attainment-adult/docview/305331855/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Torres, Jenna Patrice",2003,A cognitive approach to the acquisition of clitics in L2 Spanish: Insights from study abroad and classroom learners,"Clitics in Spanish, which include the direct and indirect object pronouns, reflexives, and middle markers, are a notorious source of difficulty for second language learners. This dissertation examines how learners use and acquire clitics according to their functions over time, and attempts to identify the cognitive processes and language use strategies responsible for the patterns during acquisition. In addition, it examines the role of the learning context via a comparison of classroom learners to study abroad learners. The data consist of conversational discourse from fifteen L2 learners (L1 English, ten study abroad and five classroom-only) over one semester, from proficiency levels ranging from novice high to advanced low. The analysis of clitics is divided into three parts: (1)&#xa0;a morphosyntactic profile of clitics, pronouns, and zeros; (2)&#xa0;a functional analysis of clitics versus other NP types in creating information flow and maintaining reference via the preferred argument structure framework of Du Bois (1987); and (3)&#xa0;an analysis of semantic categories of verbs marked and not marked with middle voice clitics. The results demonstrate that lower level learners rarely use clitics and prefer zeros, while the intermediate mid learners begin with first person clitics in a one-to-one form-function connection, followed by the addition of third person clitics in a more mulitfunctional manner. There were few contexts for clitics overall compared to native speaker use. The preferred argument structure analysis indicates that the reasons for the lack of clitics is the overuse of full NPs as objects and obliques, a preference for intransitive and copula constructions, and a lack of variety of transitive verbs overall. The third analysis indicates that initially middle constructions are formulaic, followed by the use of prototypical semantic categories involved with motion and change. Other, less prototypical uses appear at upper levels. Finally, for clitic accuracy and use study abroad does not appear to have much linguistic benefit over classroom learning; its benefits come at the discourse and pragmatic level. Study abroad learners have more native-like patterns of NP distribution, can accomplish more with their language, and improve their proficiency level to a greater degree.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/cognitive-approach-acquisition-clitics-l2-spanish/docview/305337961/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tamanaha, Masako",2003,Interlanguage speech act realization of apologies and complaints: The performances of Japanese L2 speakers in comparison with Japanese L1 and English L1 speakers,"Scholars of interlanguage pragmatics have been researching cross-cultural differences of speech act realization and second/foreign language learners' acquisition of these speech acts (e.g., Cohen &amp; Olshtain, 1981, 1996), and transfer from L1 at the pragmatic level is argued to exist (e.g., Kasper, 1992). Takahashi &amp; Beebe (1987, 1993) contend that the transfer effect is greater among high proficiency learners than among their low-proficiency counterparts because the former have enough control over the target language to utilize their L1 pragmatics in the L2. However, some studies find that the advanced learners better approximated the native speakers' performance in some uses of speech act strategies (e.g., Trosborg, 1995). This study investigates apologies and complaints elicited through interactive role-plays that are performed by American learners of Japanese, who are at intermediate (J2L) and advanced (J2H) levels in using Japanese. Native speakers of Japanese (J1) and native speakers of American English (E1) are used as comparison groups. Specifically, the present study analyzes (1)&#xa0;the characteristics of apologies and complaints produced by the J1s and the E1s, (2)&#xa0;the characteristics of Japanese learners' apologies and complaints in terms of L1 transfer and linguistic difficulties in performing such speech acts in L2, and (3)&#xa0;proficiency effects that become apparent between the J2Ls and the J2Hs. The results indicate that there are cross-cultural differences found in apology role-plays; namely, there is a tendency for the E1 speakers to prefer more rational strategies whereas the J1 speakers prefer emotional strategies as previously attested (e.g., Barnlund &amp; Yoshioka, 1990; Kumagai, 1993). In terms of complaints, the J1 speakers were overall slightly more indirect and mitigated than the E1 speakers. In terms of learner performances, the J2Ls' performed rather poorly, while the J2Hs' role-plays closely approximated those produced by the J1s both quantitatively and qualitatively as well as grammatically and pragmatically. Both the J2Ls and the J2Hs showed signs of negative pragmatic transfer from their L1 in several common features, but overall the J2Hs exhibited less negative pragmatic transfer than the J2Ls. The interactive role-plays thus proved to be an effective means to investigate the participants' pragmatic competence.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interlanguage-speech-act-realization-apologies/docview/305346758/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tadaki, Toru",2004,Comparative study of English and Japanese school texts,"This study takes a step towards answering two questions concerning L2 writing: 'Why do the Japanese write English expository essays differently in terms of discourse structure from their native English counterparts?' and 'What are the differences?' The study compares discourse structures of Japanese and English school texts from 30 Japanese junior high school pupils (14-15 years), who wrote school compositions on the occasion of their graduation, and 30 British secondary school pupils (14-16 years), who wrote GCSE coursework essays for Religious Education and English. Other written materials were collected from a Japanese school, and classrooms at a British school were observed. There are three research questions: whether the school texts are different in terms of topical progression (consisting of parallel, extended parallel, sequential and extended sequential progressions), what implications the results have in terms of genre and what implications the results have for Contrastive Rhetoric (CR) research. A review of CR literature suggests a need for further studies in this area, particularly for the exploration of the cultural and educational contexts, where preferred L1 discourse structures are likely to be taught and practised. It also raises an issue of genre, questioning whether expository writing, which has been the yardstick genre of CR research, is universally practised. Another issue is the search for a methodological framework for text analysis which can relate textual features to 'rhetorical organisation'. The apparently universal discourse structure of a meaningful utterance, topic - comment, and the central role of information structure in the construction of coherence, suggest Topical Structure Analysis (TSA) as the framework. The application of TSA to Japanese is discussed and found to be appropriate. The examination of the materials from the Japanese school and the observation of English and Religious Education classes in the British school reveal that expository writing is not practised in the Japanese school; instead, writing is used for self-reflection and self-growth. In the British school, expository writing is the major means of learning and assessment. The writing used in the Japanese school is characterised by parallel progression while English expository writing is likely to contain many topical progressions due to its clear focus on a limited number of topics and its logical nature. The TSA results show substantial differences of occurrence of topical progressions: the English texts contain more topical progressions, suggesting that they rely more than the Japanese texts on repetition of important items in conveying a sense of coherence. Parallel progression is the only type of progression that occurs more in the Japanese texts than the English texts. Examination of the results reveals the roles of topical progressions: parallel progressions for accumulation of information/descriptions, sequential progressions for development of argument, extended parallel and extended sequential progressions for repetition of important items throughout the text. The differences in the mean occurrences of topical progressions are found to be due to the difference of genre or function between the two data sets: the Japanese texts are expressive and the English texts transactional. The use of parallel progressions is associated with description within the expressive texts and the use of the other progression types is associated with the argumentative nature of English school essays. The potential of the topical marker wa in Japanese for the construction of coherence is discussed. By providing a clearer coding scheme, this study contributes to TSA studies and CR research in general. The findings support a number of earlier CR findings. Although the limited sample size prevents generalisation, the findings hint at an association between lack of experience in argumentatiy writing among Japanese secondary pupils and the L2 writing performance of Japanese students at English speaking universities. Analysis based on TSA, while unable to detect every feature of coherence in text, has the potential to provide useful data for L2 writing classrooms and for future CR research relating textual features to coherence construction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comparative-study-english-japanese-school-texts/docview/2037199305/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Eda, Sanae",2004,Processing of intonation patterns in Japanese: Implications for Japanese as a foreign language,"Accent and intonation in foreign language instruction tend to be treated in a haphazard manner for two reasons: lack of research analysis that can be applied to the second language acquisition (SLA) situation; and absence of pedagogical materials that effectively train learners on this aspect of the target language. Japanese language instruction at all levels will benefit from both deductive and inductive instructions on accent and intonation at the level of utterance and discourse. Such a seemingly challenging task can be accomplished by using a computerized exercise that involves the effects of various accent and intonation patterns. The experimental study presented in this dissertation examined the processing of three types of prosodically marked syntactic and pragmatic contrasts by native and non-native speakers of Japanese. Three results are salient. First, there was a statistically significant difference between the performance of native and non-native speakers in both the discrimination and the interpretation tasks. Second, while non-native speakers performed equally well in the discrimination task regardless of their proficiency, their performance in the identification task was strongly predicted by their proficiency. Finally, native speakers of the Tokyo dialect and speakers of other dialects performed differently on the interpretation task. As an extension of the investigation, I propose ways to make the topic of accent and intonation a part of the curriculum at all levels of instruction. I will also demonstrate a computer program currently being developed to help Japanese students improve their communicative effectiveness by directing their attention to the effects of variation in accent and intonation patterns.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-intonation-patterns-japanese/docview/305138079/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Fiori-Agoren, Melissa L.",2004,The development of grammatical competence through synchronous computer-mediated communication,"This study examined whether consciousness-raising (C-R) in synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) fosters grammatical development; specifically, development of por/para and ser/estar . In order to determine the efficacy of C-R in SCMC, two groups were analyzed; one group was designated as form-and-meaning focused while the other was meaning-focused. Each group engaged in weekly chats and addressed the same discussion topics. Three pre- and post-tests (Elicited Imitation/Sentence Repetition Testing, Grammaticality Preferences Component, and oral examinations) were administered. It was determined that: (1)&#xa0;there were statistically significant differences on the outcomes of the EI/SRT and GPC post-tests in favor of the FFMF group, (2)&#xa0;the FFMF group produced greater quantities and more accurate quantities of language, (3)&#xa0;the FFMF group demonstrated higher levels of syntactic maturity with statistically significant results, did not employ a default form of the copular verb, and actively engaged in corrective feedback strategies, (4)&#xa0;the FFMF and MF groups performed equally well, statistically, on both the post-test orals and in terms of semantic range but the social dynamic that surfaced in each group were distinct, (5)&#xa0;the MF group did not ignore form but employed ser as a default, (6)&#xa0;the instructor exercised the same feedback practices for both groups. It was concluded that C-R on por/para, ser/estar in SCMC most likely fostered the development of those grammatical features to a greater degree than in chat without specific instructions to focus on form. When held responsible for its own C-R in SCMC, consciousness was raised for the FFMF group but students were unable to limit the scope of their focus to por/para, ser/estar alone. Overt evidence reveals that they did focus on ser/estar but there is no such evidence for por/para . However, the global approach to C-R assumed by the FFMF positively impacted development, por/para included. In terms of the MF group, it is concluded that the lack of focusing on por/para, ser/estar did not impede upon development, and that unintentional focus on form was insufficient to facilitate growth to the same degree as deliberate focus, although the MF participants demonstrated awareness to form in SCMC.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-grammatical-competence-through/docview/305146874/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lin, Yi",2004,Chinese vocabulary acquisition and learning Chinese as a foreign language,"The present study anchored its inquiry in second language (L2) Chinese vocabulary acquisition (CVA) and learning Chinese as a foreign language. It investigated L2 CVA in four types: phonological comprehension, orthographic comprehension, phonological production and orthographic production, as well as their relationship with each other and with language proficiency. Vocabulary data were collected from Chinese programs in four major universities in the U.S. across seven semester levels. Along with these data, students' language scores were collected. First, descriptive and nonparametric statistics were used to confirm the existence of the four types of vocabulary and their order of development. Then correlation and regression analyses were used to find out how they were associated with each other and with language skills. Finally, the relationship between the distance between vocabulary types and language skills was studied. The study found a developing order for the four types of vocabulary, accounting for between 30% to 50% of the variance in language skill. Phonological comprehension vocabulary was largest but had the weakest relationship with language skills. Phonological production had the second smallest size but the strongest relationship with language skills. Orthographic production had the smallest size and a non-linear relationship with language skills. The distance did not correlate with language skills or correlated negatively with them. It is concluded that vocabulary exists in different sizes and forms and develops along a continuum. Words that linger at lower stages of the continuum contribute less than those at upper stages. Pedagogical implications are discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/chinese-vocabulary-acquisition-learning-as/docview/305168487/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kumagai, Yuri",2004,(De)mystifying literacy practices in a foreign language classroom: A critical discourse analysis,"This study problematizes the literacy practices of a second-year, Japanese language classroom at a small women's college. Drawing on critical perspectives on language, literacy and d/Discourse (Gee, 1990)—in particular, on sociocultural and poststructural theories—this study discusses the joint actions of a classroom teacher and her students. Using Fairclough's (1992b) model of critical discourse analysis as an analytical tool combined with the methodology of critical ethnography, this study closely examines classroom interactions through moment-by-moment analysis of numerous literacy events. Through year-long ethnographic fieldwork and two subsequent years of dialogue with the teacher, I chose to focus my study on “moments of tension.” I selected five “critical moments” when diversions from the teacher's lesson agenda were observed during the classroom literacy events. The dynamic interplay among the texts, the students' identities and the teacher's discourses inspired those critical moments. They were moments when both the teacher and the students struggled to defend what they believed as true and attempted to inhabit ideal subject positions against textual representations. My use of critical discourse analysis revealed that, in general, the students drew from the dominant discourses that the teacher had provided so that they could successfully participate and make sense of the literacy events. However, when the texts represented a reality or truth that challenged the students' beliefs about their identity and/or ontology, the students resisted such representations and “disrupted” the dominant classroom discourse by drawing on counter-discourses. Similarly, when the students' counter-discourses challenged the teacher's ontology and/or identity, she resisted taking up those discourses and tried to normalize the moments by deflecting the issues at hand and by withdrawing from the “intersection of the discourses” rather than opting to facilitate a dialogue about competing discourses. This study argues that these moments of tension displayed how students contributed significantly to the production of knowledge in the classroom. They point out how students exercise their agency and take up positions as “knowers” that align with their sense of self. My analysis also allows me to draw implications for the possibility of critical literacy practices in a FL classroom.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/de-mystifying-literacy-practices-foreign-language/docview/305176224/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Fafulas, Stephen",2013,First and second-language patterns of variation: Acquisition and use of simple present and present progressive forms in spanish and english,"This investigation addresses the acquisition of the present progressive, and the variation of this form with the simple present, by English-speaking learners of Spanish in the US. Empirical research on the variation of these forms by native speakers (NS) of English and Spanish, and, in particular the acquisition of the present progressive by nonnative speakers (NNS) of Spanish is scarce. While seeking to fill this void in the literature, a second major contribution of this project is the extension of the analysis to a broad range of progressive constructions. Relatively little is known about how English-speaking learners of Spanish deal with the differences between the uses of the simple present and present progressive forms in these two languages. At what level of proficiency do they begin to employ both forms, in similar contexts as NS of Spanish? Do they acquire the full range of progressive constructions, and sensitivity to the same linguistic predictors of use, found in NS grammars? The current study will empirically answer these questions through the use of film narrations, written contextualized questionnaires, and surveys of language-learning experiences, from 115 participants. Results indicate that as learners of Spanish gain proficiency they move toward a second-language grammar which permits variation between the simple present and present progressive forms as is found in native speaker grammars. However, while learners at the highest levels acquire the linguistic constraints guiding native speaker selection of the simple present and present progressive form, they do not acquire the full-range of lexical forms used to express progressive aspect found in monolingual Spanish. These findings have implications for current contact-induced and interlanguage theories on Spanish-English grammatical development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/first-second-language-patterns-variation/docview/1502869040/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Egi, Takako",2004,"Recasts, perceptions, and L2 development","The present study addressed the following under-explored issues: (1)&#xa0;learners' perceptions about recasts (i.e., as the interlocutor's response to content, negative evidence, and/or positive evidence), (2)&#xa0;relationship between learners' perceptions about recasts and different features of recasts, and (3)&#xa0;relationship between learners' perceptions about recasts and their subsequent L2 learning. While previous research has supported claims about the facilitative effects of recasts in SLA, there is considerable controversy regarding the precise developmental benefits of recasts. Researchers generally agree on the need for positive evidence; however, the role of negative evidence has been controversial. Given the multiple discourse functions of recasts, they are often perceived as interlocutors' reactions to content rather than corrective feedback. Researchers have suggested that such an interpretation of recasts may limit their developmental benefits. Under the premise that learners' perceptions about recasts may constrain their utility, the present study investigated a possible link between learners' perceptions about recasts and L2 learning to examine the developmental benefits of recasts. Forty-nine high-beginning to intermediate learners of Japanese carried out communicative tasks with a native speaker, during which they received recasts of their non-targetlike productions of targeted items (the te -form verbs and numeral classifiers). Short-term and more sustained learning was assessed by a combination of standard and customized immediate and delayed posttests. The learners' perceptions about recasts were measured by immediate reports (Egi, in press) or stimulated recall (Gass &amp; Mackey, 2000). The study provided a finely grained analysis of learners' various perceptions about recasts. A significant relationship was found between their perceptions about recasts and (1)&#xa0;the length of recasts and (2)&#xa0;the number of changes made to the learner's original utterance. Furthermore, the study empirically supported the claim that recasts are ineffective when learners perceive them as responses to content. A (non-significant) trend suggested that there may be greater benefits for recasts when learners perceive them as positive evidence rather than as negative evidence. In summary, this study suggests that the utility of recasts may in part be constrained by learners' perceptions about recasts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/recasts-perceptions-l2-development/docview/305187947/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shibuya, Rinko",2004,A synchronic and diachronic study on sex exclusive differences in the modern Japanese language,"This dissertation investigates Japanese morphological sex exclusive differences synchronically and diachronically. In my synchronic investigation, I examine the data of natural conversation in informal situations collected from different sex, age, and dialect groups. This investigation reveals that, contrary to the prevailing idea, overt sex exclusive differences occur with striking infrequency in both Tokyo and non-Tokyo dialects. In contrast, covert differences are carefully preserved in the Tokyo dialect. Among non-Tokyo dialects, which had little sex differences before, covert differences are spreading. Since previous linguistic studies have focused only on what was explicitly spoken (or written), such covert sex differences have been overlooked. I illustrate these phenomena postulating two types of rules, prescriptive and proscriptive, which operate upon speakers to maintain mutual exclusiveness between male speech and female speech. Prescriptive rules emphasize the differences between the sexes. Proscriptive rules prohibit transgressions of the boundaries between the sexes. Since preferred images of a gender change over time, prescriptive rules are fluid. On the other hand, the violation of proscriptive rules brings serious penalty to speakers. In order to clarify how such rules were engendered, I explore the historical process in which certain forms were designated as gendered as they are in present-day Japan. I argue that this designation is the consequence of the amalgamation of several socio-historical changes that took place in the Meiji period (1868–1912). These are: (1)&#xa0;the influx of English words, which triggered the formation of new intonational variants of the existent forms, (2)&#xa0;the introduction of western notions of ‘love’, which triggered the creation of a new female figure in the Meiji novels and, (3)&#xa0;the establishment of standard Japanese and the subsequent development of the mass media, which promulgated the concept that the informal speech of the Tokyo dialect was the model speech for women in general. My diachronic investigation also reveals that the function of female speech is to mark feminine sexuality. This function explains why sex differences in informal situations occur much less than generally believed, and why using female speech is inappropriate in formal situations, even though it is polite speech.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/synchronic-diachronic-study-on-sex-exclusive/docview/305220208/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Atbaş, Emil Ertuğrul",2004,The Effects of Students' Entering Characteristics and Classroom Environment Experiences on Their Language Learning Outcomes in an EFL Setting in Turkey,"This study investigated the impact of several affective, cognitive, and demographic entering characteristics of students and their experiences of the psychosocial, instructional and managerial, physical, and course-related materials aspects of the classroom environment in accounting for three language learning outcomes; class participation, study habits, and English achievement. The subjects of the study ( N = 519) were the preparatory class students of various departments of Erciyes University in Kayseri who received a one-year English instruction at Erciyes University School of Foreign Languages (EUSFL) during the academic year 2001- 2002. In line with the “Input-Context-Outcome” research framework of the study, the data were gathered from the students through self-report questionnaires and school records prior to (Input-entering student characteristics variables), during (Context- classroom environment variables), and at the end (Outcome) of the specified instructional period (one-semester), which were subjected to various applications of Multivariate Linear Regression procedures. The findings indicated different patterns of relationships depending on the type of outcome assessed with significant predictors from both input and context classes. In descending order of effect size, the significant predictors of class participation were teacher supportiveness, involvement, satisfaction with course materials, speaking anxiety, self-concept, task orientation and organization, effort, student cohesiveness, physical conditions, overall academic achievement, and previous exposure, which altogether accounted for 74 % of the variance in students’ levels of class participation. The amount of variance accounted for study habits was 40 %, with involvement, overall academic achievement, self-concept, student residence, and gender emerging as significant predictors. As for the English achievement criterion, overall academic achievement, teacher supportiveness, selfconcept, involvement, satisfaction with course materials, previous exposure, and student residence were significant predictors which accounted for 56 % of the overall variance. The findings are discussed in light of relevant theory and empirical research and suggestions are made for pedagogical practices and further research directions.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-students-entering-characteristics/docview/3132854529/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Gabriele, Alison",2005,The Acquisition of Aspect in a Second Language: A Bidirectional Study of Learners of English and Japanese,"This dissertation investigates the second language (L2) acquisition of aspectual morphology within the framework of formal, truth-conditional semantics (Tarski, 1944; Davidson, 1969). We evaluate the relative contribution of the native language grammar and the input available to the learner in an effort to develop a comprehensive model of the L2 acquisition of aspect. The focus is on the acquisition of the semantics of the forms that mark the progressive in English and Japanese. The two forms, be + ing in English and te-iru in Japanese, interact differently with the lexical aspect of the verb phrase to which they attach. In English, the progressive denotes an event-in-progress interpretation regardless of the verb. In Japanese, achievements such as die are incompatible with a progressive interpretation, allowing only for a resultative interpretation of V+ te-iru (Jacobsen, 1992; McClure, 1995; Ogihara, 1998, 1999; Shirai, 2000, i.a.). The analysis that we adopt, McClure (1995), argues that the difference lies in the truth conditions of the aspectual operator PROD in the two languages. In a controlled, bidirectional, experimental study we investigate the L2 acquisition of this crosslinguistic difference using two tasks: a grammaticality judgment task and an interpretation task. Adult learners from a range of proficiency levels are tested including a group of near-natives in the L2 English study. The results of the interpretation task suggest that learners have more difficulty preempting an interpretation that is not available in the L2, but is an option in the L1. Results also indicate that L2 learners have considerably less difficulty adding an interpretation to their L2 grammar that is not available in the native language. We argue that these results can be accounted for if we consider the role of the input available to the learner. Results also reveal that there are contexts where L2 learners follow developmental patterns similar to L1 learners. We argue that a comprehensive model of the L2 acquisition of aspect must consider not only properties of the learner's grammar but also the role of input and how principles of learnability interact with the learners' grammatical representation in the course of development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-aspect-second-language-bidirectional/docview/193966779/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tominaga, Waka",2005,We Are All Stars: An Ethnographic Study of First-Grade Classrooms in a Bilingual School in Japan,"The primary purpose of this study is to look at practices at an English-Japanese bilingual school in Japan to obtain pedagogical insights for bilingual education and second language learning in the classroom. I advocate bilingual education that aims at students' bilingualism and biliteracy as a means to approach an ideal of multilingualism and multiculturalism in school. In this global era, mainstream schools serve an increasing number of children from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and are faced with the problems of minority students' academic failure. Thus, as the need for bilingual education that addresses these issues increases, research on bilingual education that provides pedagogical insights on educational practices is imminent and necessary. In this study, I will investigate the pedagogical practices at an English-Japanese bilingual school in Japan. This small but unique school, run by a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization, was established by parents in Okinawa in 1998, in order to empower Amerasian children through the means of bilingual/bicultural education. I will look at the practices of the first-grade English- and Japanese-medium classrooms and examine how young children participated in lessons and play. It is my goal that this study will add to the scholarship on bilingual education and second language learning as well as work to inform educational practices involving children from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/we-are-all-stars-ethnographic-study-first-grade/docview/2581042021/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"O'Donnell, Mary E.",2005,Use of textual elaboration with literary texts in intermediate Spanish,"The purpose of this study was to analyze textual elaboration as a modification option for literary texts in an intermediate Spanish language course. This study suggests that literary texts might obtain a more predominant place in second language instruction, especially for readers with lower levels of language proficiency, if learners were supplied with additional tools to facilitate comprehension. Elaboration is one of these tools that could ease comprehension difficulty that occur due to as text failure; that is, the difficulties readers encounter when the text's structure is so obtuse or unfamiliar to the reader. Here, readers' response to textual elaboration was tested and measured. Readers' comprehension was assessed via three instruments: (a)&#xa0;a recall protocol, (b)&#xa0;multiple-choice questions and (c)&#xa0;short constructed response questions. The study findings indicate that elaborative modifications to literary texts influence the amount and kind of information that intermediate-level Spanish learners comprehend about the texts. Limited-proficiency L2 readers of short literary texts that have been modified elaboratively can recall more information about the texts and are able to identify more vocabulary that appeared within the text. They cannot, however, infer meaning from these texts to a greater degree than the readers of unmodified versions of the same texts. Moreover, level of text difficult plays a pivotal role in relations to the effectiveness of elaborative modifications. In term of comprehension, students who read unmodified texts that are relatively easy to comprehend benefit the least from elaborative modifications.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/use-textual-elaboration-with-literary-texts/docview/304988338/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Talmy, Steven",2005,"Lifers and FOBs, rocks and resistance: Generation 1.5, identity, and the cultural productions of ESL in a high school","This two and a half year-long critical ethnography considers “the cultural productions of the ESL student” (Levinson, Foley, &amp; Holland, 1996) at a multilingual, multiethnic high school in Hawai'i. Specifically, it considers two broadly competing cultural productions of ESL in the high school context, an official, school-sanctioned cultural production, and an oppositional “generation 1.5” ESL student cultural production. The former is examined through national and state educational and language policies aimed at ESL students, ESL program organization, intra-institutional relationships, curriculum, and instructional practices. The generation 1.5, or long-term, US-educated learners of ESL (Harklau, Losey, &amp; Siegal, 1999), cultural productions are considered through analysis of an array of situated social practices these students take up in ESL classrooms that are both indexical of their resistance and that work to make the ESL program precisely what it is these students claim to be resisting: a slowed down, low-prestige, academically inconsequential program. Six primary “performance strike” (Shor, 1992) practices are considered in microanalytic detail: not bringing books to class, not doing classwork, starting late and finishing early, resisting and reproducing “FOBeing,” bargaining, and “Worksheet Syndrome.” As well, four “defensive teaching” (McNeil, 1986) accommodations are similarly analysed: study hall, floating deadlines, alternative assignments, and test preparation. The study is broadly situated within a social practice theoretical framework, and draws specifically on communities of practice (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and language socialization (Schiefflin &amp; Ochs, 1996; Ochs, 1996; Duff, 2002, 2003). A central point is that as the ESL teachers and students are agents multiply situated in historical, political, and social contexts, the cultural productions of ESL are not simply one-way, top-down phenomena, nor are they mere reflections of negative societal valuations about immigrants, bi- and multilingualism, and non-native Englishes. Rather, they are jointly constructed by teachers and students in the social practices of everyday classroom life. In these terms, the study highlights the situated, contingent, multidirectional socialization processes that occur among teachers and students, and how these can affect L2 teaching and learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/lifers-fobs-rocks-resistance-generation-1-5/docview/305001534/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hagiwara, Akiko",2005,Comprehending utterances in Japanese as a first and a second language: Literality and conventionality,"Literality in interpersonal communication has been discussed in language philosophy as well as in psycholinguistics, in which the relationship between what is actually uttered and what is intended has been an issue. The gap between them can be explained in two different ways: one is the conventionality of language use and the other is through inference based on the literal meaning. These two explanations contrast in such a way that the former does not assume that the literal meaning of the utterance necessarily contributes to the generation of its intended meaning, whereas the latter treats the literal meaning as the basis of the inference. Theoretically speaking, it may be possible to categorize non-literal utterances into roughly two types: conventional utterances and non-conventional utterances. For the latter type, if the gap between what is uttered and what is communicated is perceived as small, it can be considered that the utterance is more literal. The present study examined how both native Japanese speakers and learners of Japanese, who are native speakers of American English, perceive three types of utterances, literal utterances (e.g., Kyoo wa shokuji o gochisooshite-itadaite, doomo arigatoo gozaimashita .), non-literal non-conventional utterances (e.g., Kondo baito-dai haittara, watashi ga gochisoo shimasu ne .), and non-literal conventional utterances (e.g., Gochisoo sama deshita .), using a set of multiple-choice questionnaires asking the participants to choose the most likely interpretation of the utterance. Two groups of university students, 60 native speakers of Japanese and 60 native speakers of American English, who had completed two-years of formal Japanese instruction, participated in the study. The effect of the language groups, L1 and L2, was statistically significant (p &lt; .0001) and the interaction between the utterance types and language groups was also significant (p = .0052), while the effect of utterance types was not significant (p = .2911). The most obvious difference between native and non-native speakers of Japanese was found when they interpreted non-literal conventional utterances, while the difference was the smallest for literal utterances. These findings suggest that non-native speakers of Japanese are more likely to fail to comprehend conventionally used indirect utterances that native speakers use frequently in daily communication.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comprehending-utterances-japanese-as-first-second/docview/305002613/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Liao, Chu Hsiu",2005,First language use in EFL (English as a foreign language) writing processes,"The purpose of the dissertation was to investigate English as a foreign language (EFL) students' use of their first language (L1) in composing English texts. The first study focused on factors associated with students' spontaneous use of L1 in EFL writing. The research questions of this study concerned how spontaneous L1 use in EFL writing may interact with cognitive demands of writing tasks, learners' English proficiency, and writing quality. Thirty Taiwanese college students from different disciplines participated. Writing tasks included the issue analysis and argument analysis tasks, both derived from GRE and GMAT writing. Students' percentage of L1 use in think-aloud protocols was calculated within each phase of the composing process and compared to the cognitive demands of writing tasks, students' English proficiency, and writing scores. EFL students' percentage of L1 use was found to vary not only by cognitive demands of writing tasks but also by types of writing tasks. Total quantity of L1 use of EFL students was not related to their English proficiency. Further, EFL students' spontaneous use of L1 was found to be associated with better writing quality when used in activities such as making logical transitions, posing questions about logic and content development, or summarizing long chunks of reasoning. The second study, concerning the advantage of L1 used as the only composing language in EFL writing, looked in detail at four cases to examine factors such as the cognitive demands of writing tasks, students' English proficiency, and students' ability to use L1 strategically. The choice of composing language was found to be associated with English writing quality only in cognitively demanding writing tasks, such as argumentation. In argumentation, the advantages of composing in L1 depended on the interaction of students' English proficiency and students' ability to use L1 strategically. Compared to English, L1 Chinese as a composing language was advantageous to writing quality when students had either the ability to use L1 strategically or high English proficiency. On the other hand, L1 as a composing language was disadvantageous to English writing scores when the student had neither the ability to use L1 strategically nor high English proficiency.

"Rothman, Jason",2005,On adult accessibility to universal grammar in second language (L2) acquisition: Some evidence from the L2 acquisition of Spanish,"The field of second language acquisition (SLA) is as vast as it is diverse. Nonetheless, the ultimate goal of all SLA researchers is one and the same; explaining how the process of adult second language (L2) acquisition occurs. This present research is undertaken from the generative paradigm of language acquisition. The dissertation is primarily concerned with providing empirical evidence in favor or against adult L2 accessibility to UG. The empirical research of this dissertation entails a study designed to test English native L2 learners of Spanish as to their ability to re-set the null-subject parameter and the status of the Overt Pronoun Constraint (OPC) in their L2 grammars. In both cases, adult L2 ability to achieve a native type grammar given these grammatical properties should implicate access to UG. However, L2 instantiation of the OPC, true poverty of the stimulus knowledge, will provide unassailable evidence. This study examines longitudinally the interlanguage grammatical development of college L2 learners of Spanish (intermediate level) enrolled in the Universidad de Madrid through the University of California education abroad program for one academic year of study abroad. The profile of the intermediate level participants in the study is as homogeneous as possible given real world limitations and discussed in detail herein. The metalinguistic judgment/performance tasks include two different tests for each syntactic property under investigation: two for the re-setting of the null-subject parameter and two for the OPC tested as a separate variable. For each syntactic feature there is one judgment task and one production task. The data indicate, at the group level, the ability to reset the pro-drop parameter and the instantiation of the OPC in general. However, the individual results indicate that, by the end of the study, a significant number of L2 learners in this population (roughly 26%) have not re-set the null-subject parameter and thus, not surprisingly, do not have the OPC instantiated into their L2 grammars. Since overall proficiency (determined separately) is not a good indicator of which L2 learners have re-set the parameter, the Variable Access Hypothesis is offered to account for these facts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/on-adult-accessibility-universal-grammar-second/docview/305032161/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Luo, Lynn Yu",2005,A systemic functional perspective on native and non -native English speaking students' online discussion in a mixed -mode graduate seminar,"In North America, computer-mediated communication is increasingly used as a means of communication for university courses generally involving both native English speaking (NES) and non-native English speaking (NNES) students. How do they participate in online interaction? How does their academic discourse develop during online interactions? Can a functional linguistic approach illuminate aspects of these questions overlooked by a more traditional linguistic approach? Adopting the systemic functional linguistics perspective, this exploratory qualitative study addresses these issues by examining the perspectives and experiences of fourteen graduate students (5 NNES focal participants and 9 NES students) participating in online discussion in a mixed-mode graduate seminar at a Canadian university. Collected from a three-week summer course, the data for analysis mainly consisted of observations of face-to-face classroom discussions and online discussions, questionnaires, interviews, and online protocols. This study explored online discussion at multiple levels: the social practice level, the discourse level, and the sentence/clause level. At the social practice level, the findings illustrated that online discussion, as a new social practice to the participants, was a very complex endeavor in a larger sociocultural context. The online participants brought to the online forum a wide range of backgrounds and experiences as well as varied voices and perspectives on this instructional innovation. At the discourse level, the study illustrated ongoing construction of online discourse and its complexities, dilemmas and negotiations. The results showed that the construction of an online register was a sociocultural linguistic process which involves education, culture, agency, and identity. Turning to the sentence/clause level, the findings illustrated an analysis of functional recasts in students' online interactions and addressed issues of advanced language development. As the first systemic functional inquiry on online discussion by NES and NNES graduate students at multiple levels, this study points to the need for research in this area that follows a systemic functional perspective.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/systemic-functional-perspective-on-native-non/docview/305349655/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Baker, Susan C.",2005,A social psychological approach to preserving heritage languages: The survival of Gaelic in Nova Scotia,"Language has been seen as a central pillar to ethnic identity. When languages are at risk, therefore, the relationship between language and ethnic identity can become particularly salient (Edwards, 1991). Heritage languages, in particular, often face what has been called a language shift, where the heritage language is replaced by the dominant language. When the heritage language is threatened, what happens to the heritage identity? In an attempt to answer this question, this study investigated the relationship between language and ethnic identity among 75 Gaelic learners living in eastern Nova Scotia. In order to identify the specific processes of heritage language use, the Gaelic learners were compared to non-learners of Gaelic and French learners living in the same milieu. Path analyses indicated that, among Gaelic learners, there is an initial separation of language and ethnic identity, but that, over time, ethnic identity is a direct outcome of language use. This finding was unique to the heritage language learners. Further, desired language vitality was a direct precursor to contact, language confidence, Gaelic and Anglophone identity and willingness to communicate among Gaelic learners. Actual language vitality played no role in the language use process among Gaelic learners, suggesting that vitality perceptions that are egocentric are better predictors of language use than those that are exocentric. The implications of these findings are discussed not only in relation to the future of Gaelic in Nova Scotia, but also to the survival of heritage languages in general.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/social-psychological-approach-preserving-heritage/docview/305368166/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Reeder, Florence M.",2005,Improving machine translation evaluation using language learner evaluation techniques,"This thesis shows that machine translation evaluation (MTE) benefits from research performed for computer-assisted language learning and second language acquisition, particularly from the area of language learner evaluation. MTE has lacked organization and principled approaches, a situation remedied in part by this dissertation. The process of organizing MTE shows commonalities with second language learner evaluation (LLE), particularly in processing ill-formed input and first language interference. These commonalities facilitate the successful application of LLE testing techniques to MTE problems. To demonstrate this, a series of experiments has been developed which use language testing research results and techniques in MTE. The first experiment shows the feasibility of adapting techniques from LLE to MTE. The second demonstrates a method for assessing the intelligibility of MT output. The third provides a new metric for measuring the adequacy of a translation's semantic content. The outcomes show the efficacy of using LLE testing, appropriately modified, in MTE. They also provide a basis for recommending a novel, effective, more automated approach to MTE.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/improving-machine-translation-evaluation-using/docview/305368258/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Jacobson, Erik Hugo",2004,Community -building in Japanese adult basic education,"By means of an ethnographic multi-case study of three adult basic education programs in Nara prefecture, Japan, this dissertation explores the nature of community building within the adult basic education classroom. It also provides examples of how the sociocultural context of adult basic education in Japan shapes the decisions programs make about the content and nature of adult literacy instruction, the role of assessment in adult basic education, and the nature of teacher preparation. Students in Japanese adult basic education programs are drawn from different minority communities in Japan (burakumin, Koreans, and immigrants) that have a history of being discriminated against, and who remain marginalized by the Japanese mainstream. As a response to both the social and academic needs of adult learners, the adult basic education programs that were part of this study attempt to build a sense of community within the classroom itself. In the process of building this community, students and teachers gave priority to non-academic goals. This created the following expectations: (1)&#xa0;Literacy instruction is to be used for psychological healing and student empowerment, (2)&#xa0;The creation of tight bonds between teachers and students is a goal of the class, rather than just a method, and (3)&#xa0;Classrooms have to be safe spaces for teachers, as well as students, to gather and recuperate. Students and teachers in these programs also rejected the dominant model of Japanese secondary education which prioritizes competition between students and the mastery of a decontextualized curriculum. In keeping with the goals of creating a safe and responsive space, the programs: (1)&#xa0;Utilize an open curriculum, (2)&#xa0;Reject assessment and time limitations put on student tenure, and (3)&#xa0;Problematize the hierarchical student-teacher relationship. In my analysis, I suggest that what informs students' and teachers' decisions is a discourse of empathy which values emotion as a key way of understanding the experiences of others, and views subjectivity as achieved through intersubjective communication. I also suggest that this concern with empathy leads some schools in Japan to provide adult basic education programming that looks very different from what is offered in the United States.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/community-building-japanese-adult-basic-education/docview/305190551/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Chung, Eun Seon",2013,Exploring the degree of native-likeness in bilingual acquisition: Second and heritage language acquisition of Korean case-ellipsis,"The primary objective of this dissertation is to investigate how early and late bilinguals attain implicit knowledge of Korean case ellipsis (CE) that necessitates integration of multiple types of information and poses many learnability problems for the learners. The present research examines similarities and differences between the different types of bilinguals as well as between monolingual and bilingual populations. An oral picture description task and a written forced-choice elicitation task are developed to investigate how different populations employ the relevant factors in Korean CE and if certain types of cues are more accessible than others. The results reveal qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic knowledge of early vs. late bilinguals with heritage language learners (i.e., early bilinguals) achieving a higher level of mastery than second language learners (i.e., late bilinguals) in both oral and written tasks. It seems possible for heritage language learners to attain implicit knowledge of Korean CE, and parallels can be drawn between these learners and monolingual children. Second language learners, on the other hand, showed divergent and variable patterns in judgment and production, which question their ability to acquire the phenomenon. The results underline the importance of age, context, and mode of acquisition in bilingual acquisition as the learners showed a tendency to depend on factors/cues that are more readily available to them in their respective context and mode of acquisition. The effects of task and structural priming are also discussed. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that different types of bilinguals process and acquire the phenomenon of Korean CE differently, and that bilingual difficulty does not lie in particular domains but is more computational in nature with learners failing to effectively incorporate multiple levels of information in a native-like manner.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-degree-native-likeness-bilingual/docview/1517975120/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Cabrelli Amaro, Jennifer Lauren",2013,The phonological permeability hypothesis: Measuring regressive L3 influence to test L1 and L2 phonological representations,"The Phonological Permeability Hypothesis (PPH, Cabrelli Amaro &amp; Rothman, 2010) attempts to reconcile evidence suggesting some L2 learners, however rare, attain native-like L2 phonological systems with the observation that most do not. Considering existing L2 phonology research, it is not clear that phonological differences between early and late acquirers must be the consequence of maturational effects on implicit mechanisms. Thus, to test how native-like adult-acquired systems are, the extent to which early- and late-acquired systems are equally resilient to influence from an L3 is examined. The PPH posits that native-like phonological systems acquired in adulthood are different from systems acquired in childhood with regards to relative stability. To test the PPH, a cross-sectional study of three types of English/Spanish bilinguals differing in age and context of acquisition (AoA) of Spanish was carried out to examine whether AoA determines relative vulnerability of the Spanish phonological system when exposed to L3 BP. In addition, a longitudinal case study was conducted, observing an L1 English/L2 Spanish bilingual’s Spanish prior to BP exposure, and his BP and Spanish after 11 weeks of BP immersion. The focus of the investigation was the acquisition of reduced word-final unstressed vowels [I] and [near-close near-back rounded vowel] in BP and potential regressive influence on the perception, production, and processing of Spanish word-final unstressed [e] and [o]. Results from the cross-sectional study did not reveal any between-group differences in perception, production, or reaction time in terms of BP influence on Spanish. Therefore, these data align with the possibility that AoA does not determine the relative stability of a phonological system in terms of mental representation or processing. However, while these data do not support the PPH, evidence meeting the criteria for falsification of the PPH is also lacking. The case study results are indicative of rapid and permeating L3 influence on the learner’s Spanish processing during speech production, and a large-scale longitudinal investigation of the three bilingual types tested here is necessary to reveal whether early and late acquirers of Spanish are equally vulnerable to L3 influence and what the nature of any observed vulnerability is.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/phonological-permeability-hypothesis-measuring/docview/1520189172/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Fernandez, Julieta",2013,Social networks and youngspeak in study abroad,"Interactions with experienced L2 speakers can have a positive effect on study abroad (SA) students’ language acquisition (e.g., development in informal vocabulary use, Schauer, 2009). Many SA students, however, experience difficulties in establishing social networks in Latin America (e.g., Isabelli-García, 2006). SA experience, therefore, cannot be automatically equated with language immersion (Kinginger, 2009). With these considerations in mind, this dissertation examines the development in SA students’ use of a specific group of Spanish lexical features that are characteristic of youngspeak (Stenström &amp; Jørgensen, 2009), i.e. the unplanned spoken discourse of undergraduate speakers, such as general extenders (Overstreet, 1999) (e.g., o algo así “or something like that”), discourse markers (e.g., tipo “like”) and colloquial words (e.g., chamuyar “sweet talk”). English L1 undergraduate participants (n=12) at different Spanish L2 proficiency levels were each paired with Argentine experienced speakers of Spanish for the duration of their 4-month sojourn. The conversation partners were 18- to 22-year-old undergraduate students at universities in Buenos Aires. The results revealed a number of trends in participants’ exposure to, use, and dispositions toward Argentine youngspeak and their relationship to participants’ ability or desire to establish social networks in Argentina. The results revealed that some participants saw the use of youngspeak as a hallmark of L2 proficiency, while others avoided it due to emotional risks. The informal interactions that the participants engaged in with their conversation partners did not always result in increased opportunities to learn informal language features. The majority of the participants reported interacting predominantly with their host families and learning most of the informal language features in their Spanish courses. These courses, however, were found to provide limited pedagogical framing of pragmatic functions and register variation. Implications for study abroad research, language development, and pedagogy are discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/social-networks-youngspeak-study-abroad/docview/1773389240/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Eshita, Yoko",2019,Individual Differences in Comprehending Japanese Scrambled Sentences,"This study’s aim is to investigate further into the relationship between individual differences—working memory and sound recognition ability—and sentence processing of Japanese scrambled sentences for second language (L2) Japanese learners. L2 Japanese learners drawn from 3rd year college-level courses or above were tested on their listening comprehension accuracy in identifying case marking particles in canonical and scrambled sentences. Participants demonstrated a significant slowdown in reaction time and low accuracy rates for scrambled sentences compared with canonical sentences. In addition, even participants with high working memory and proficiency had difficulty in comprehending scrambled sentences and could not process case markings efficiently and accurately in a timed setting. This study is significant in that it is one of the first to examine the relationship between individual differences and comprehending Japanese case markings.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/individual-differences-comprehending-japanese/docview/2288064903/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Saternus, Julie",2019,"Multilingual Literacy Practices in One School Community: Reading, Writing, and Being Across Japanese and English","Scholars writing in translingual studies view language boundaries as fluid, consider multilinguals to have options that include shuttling back and forth between languages in order to achieve their rhetorical goals, and argue that monolingual ideologies are harmful. Translingual studies is part of a movement away from structuralist conceptions of language, and within translingualism language is viewed as ""flexible, unstable, dynamic, layered, and mobile"" (Blommaert, 2016, p. 244). This dissertation focuses on the translingual literacy practices of multilingual members of the Japanese/English school community at this university. I analyze writing processes, speech, and media usage of members of this community (English L1/Japanese L2 and Japanese L1/English L2) through the lens of translingualism. I find that the ways the participants move across English and Japanese is a dynamic and negotiable process. This study aims to contribute to the movement in translingual studies that changes the focus from mixed-language products to mixed-language processes. The movement to process, I argue, takes into consideration the goals of many learners of a second language, which is to gain a strong, native-like command of dominant varieties of foreign languages. This project makes a methodological contribution to the field by demonstrating ways in which translingual literacy practices may be studied. In addition, this study discusses detailed ways in which the participants use both English and Japanese in their literacy practices through multiple case studies. I conclude with a turn that focuses on pedagogical applications of the translingual framework, which I argue benefits both monolingual and multilingual students in writing classrooms.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/multilingual-literacy-practices-one-school/docview/2274686996/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Choi, Youngae",2019,Agency and Learning English as an L2: An L2 Learner's Language Socialization in a Preschool Classroom,"Agency is regarded as the fundamental construct in second language (L2) learning. Despite the importance, agency has not been fully investigated in children’s L2 learning. Moreover, there are predominant dichotomous views of agency, such as conformity and resistance. To gain an understanding of the complex concept of agency, this study asked two research questions: 1) How does an L2 child’s agency emerge and change in social interaction over time in a preschool classroom? 2) How does co-evolution of the L2 child’s agency, interaction, and participation of the L2 child influence his learning English as an L2? This research employed an ethnographic case study. During the 2015–2016 academic year, one Korean-American boy, Han, was observed in his church-based preschool classroom. Primary data sources included: a) observation audio records, b) field notes, c) three interviews with classroom teachers, Han’s parent, and all 17 children, and d) photographed artifacts. After transcribing more than 80 hours of data, this study employed multiple data sources to answer each research question in association with multiple round coding cycles. This included a friendship network map from children’s interview data and descriptive statistics of Han’s English learning outcomes by using web-based lexical and syntactic complexity analyzer. In the findings, eight types of agency illustrated how Han identified his position relative to others, actively decided what role he would play to join a particular activity, and enacted his agency to represent himself in different ways. Han’s English learning outcomes, including in the number of different vocabulary words, sentences, and verb phrases and the mean length of utterance, substantially improved over the year. By comparing English learning improvement to changes in the eight types of agency Han exhibited, this study was able to identify the strong relations between Han’s English improvement and his agency of attempting to control interactions with socially unpowerful peers. This finding illuminated one possible way to be successful in L2 learning in which L2 children actively take the initiative in interactions rather than being prosocial and adopting follower roles.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/agency-learning-english-as-l2-learners-language/docview/2244465739/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Abu Helal, Abdel-Rahman",2019,Logical Form in the Second Language: An Investigation Into Quantification in Interlanguage,"In coping with variability in morphological production in L2 acquisition, which represents a challenge for the parameter (re-)setting theories, Lardiere (2008) proposed the feature reassembly hypothesis in which sequential difficulty in L2 acquisition of morpho-syntactic features is captured by the processes of (re-)assembly and mapping of features onto their morphological realizations. Slabakova (2009, 2013) incorporated Lardiere’s proposal in establishing a scale of difficulty in learning semantic properties (e.g. definiteness) which is based on whether reassembly is needed and whether the universal meaning is obtained by overt morphology or context (See also Ramchand &amp; Svenonius, 2008). In considering the truth-conditional aspect of meaning, the feature-based framework is not powerful enough to account for the variability of interpretations that L2 learners come to learn. Take as an example the acquisition of English comparatives by Japanese L2 learners. We discuss the L2 acquisition of a special type of syntaxsemantics mismatch in which in which a certain meaningprimitive (i.e., comparative and tense) is expressed using different truth conditions in the native and target language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/logical-form-second-language-investigation-into/docview/2236363343/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zalaltdinova, Liya",2019,Modality as a Reflection of Pragmatic Competence: Exploring Modification of ELLs' Pragmatic Knowledge Based on the Use of Modality in the Context of Peer Feedback,"The aim of the study is to identify characteristic features of modality use as demonstrated by intermediate and advanced English Language Learners (ELLs), to examine the change, if any, in the characteristic set of features of modality use by advanced as compared to intermediate ELLs, and finally to explore the factors triggering identified modality use as demonstrated by advanced ELLs while they provide evaluation and suggestions in the context of peer feedback. This cross-sectional, developmental, mixed-method study of sequential-explanatory design relied on a new theoretical framework to guide research on pragmatic competence – one for all language codes –, a discourse functional concept-oriented approach for the analysis of language use by ELLs, and on both qualitative and quantitative data in its attempt to get a nuanced understanding of the nature and elements of the pragmatic competence development as related to modality. Additionally, this study recruited the population to be inclusive and representative of diverse socio-cultural backgrounds. The results of the study point to the developmental, but at the same time dynamic and complex, nature of pragmatic competence related to modality. While advanced ELLs showed much more alignment with the expected modality use in the context of peer feedback than intermediate group, they still demonstrated their own unique pattern of modality use. The possibility of identifiable pattern of modality at each proficiency level regardless of ELLs’ affiliation with a particular socio-cultural group ruled out the effect of L1 as the only or most decisive factor affecting ELLs’ pragmatic language use and development in L2. The same was true for the lack of meta-pragmatic knowledge, since ELLs were well aware of the expected modality use. This study revealed the following factors to be worth considering for the explanation of characteristic modality pattern by ELLs: a partially synergized network of tightly related synergic concepts, resistance and the effect of subconscious and unreflective habitus.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/modality-as-reflection-pragmatic-competence/docview/2235424732/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Benda, Natalie C.",2019,Using Cognitive Work Analysis to Understand and Improve Communication between Limited English Proficient Patients and Emergency Department Care Providers,"Nearly 9% of the United States population is not proficient in the English language. Patients with limited English proficiency face significant healthcare disparities related to the quality, safety, and satisfaction with the healthcare they receive. While these disparities have been well-documented over the past 30 years, little progress has been made to improve these inequities. A key gap is lack of knowledge surrounding strategies different care providers and interpreters use to communicate with patients. This work utilizes cognitive work analysis as a framework to understand key communicative tasks and strategies utilized in communication with patients in the emergency department. The structure of tasks and strategies developed is then utilized to discuss how communication with limited English proficient patients in the emergency department may be improved. This work involved three phases of data collection including: initial modeling of the work domain, observations of patients in the emergency department, and member checking interviews with key stakeholder. Sixteen Spanish and English-speaking patients were observed throughout their stay in the emergency department to identify the communicative tasks, strategies, and aids utilized as well as contextual factors that may impact communication. The results of these observations were then vetted and updated through member-checking interviews with key stakeholders. Key themes from the data collected include: complexity of interpreter service use throughout the entire patient stay, the ability of professional interpreters to anticipate and mitigate communication issues, professional interpreters serving as a navigator for the patient, issues associated with using phone-based interpreter services, and difficulties encountered when communicating with the patients without use of an interpreter. These findings can be utilized to improve training for key stakeholders and delivery of further solutions. Further, the conclusions of this work suggest new tools, outside of the realm of human interpreters may be advantageous in improving communication with LEP patients.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/using-cognitive-work-analysis-understand-improve/docview/2193826742/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Social network data has proven useful in explaining some of the variance in oral proficiency gains (Baker-Smemoe, Dewey, Bown, &amp; Martinsen, 2014; Isabelli-García, 2006), and the current study builds on those findings by applying the same methodology to listening and reading proficiency in addition to speaking. Proficiency gains in listening, reading, and speaking were measured for 17 students from a US university studying abroad in Nanjing, China for one semester. Social network measures focused on interaction with native speakers (NS) were taken at the beginning, middle, and end of the study abroad program using the Study Abroad Social Interaction Questionnaire. Linear regression analyses showed that social network measures accounted for nearly 46% of the variance in listening gains, nearly 82% of the variance in reading gains, and nearly 46% of the variance in oral proficiency gains. These findings make a strong case for applying social network methods to understand listening and reading proficiency gains in study abroad.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/predicting-speaking-listening-reading-proficiency/docview/2723858767/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"AL-Fatlawi, Dheyaa",2018,Online Sarcasm and Its Perception by Second Language Learners: The Case of Iraqi EFL Learners in Iraq and the UK,"Although many studies have been written within L2 pragmatics, very few have dealt with L2 irony and sarcasm. The main purpose of this study is to investigate how EFL learners recognize written British English sarcasm. For this purpose, an L2 pragmatics study was designed and applied to two groups of L2 learners of English. Another purpose of the study is to pragmatically analyse online sarcasm, and see how it is used and by what features it is characterized. A corpus study was conducted for the latter purpose. Regarding data, this study used naturally-occurring sarcasm from real-life situations. The data was collected from a football forum (Manchester United forum; likely used by males) and two parenting forums (Mumsnet and Netmums; likely used by females). These different forums were targeted to ensure a rough gender balance. Sarcasm was identified within these forums by means of a metalanguage strategy. This strategy involved searching for the metalinguistic labels sarcasm and sarcastic, and then extracting and analyzing the antecedent discourses these labels are referring to. Those discourses were considered a potential environment for sarcasm. One hundred and forty two sarcasm-containing threads were collected via the metalanguage strategy. First, the data was pragmatically investigated to reveal the general pragmatic characteristics of sarcasm (e.g. Contradiction: saying something and meaning the opposite or Insincerity: flouting the Gricean quality maxim ), as well as its pragmalinguistic characteristics (e.g. hyperbolic expressions, capitalization, exclamation marks) that are used in the data. This is the ‗Corpus Study‘. Second, the analysed data served as an item pool for the judgment task of the L2 pragmatics study. From that pool, 30 items were ultimately selected as stimuli for that L2 study. Two groups of Iraqi EFL learners participated in the L2 pragmatics study. Each group contained 30 participants. The members of the first group were studying L2 English at home (Iraq) and had never been to any English-speaking country. The second group involved learners who received their BA and/or MA degree(s) in English from Iraq and were pursuing MA or PhD degrees at different UK universities. Members of the latter group had 1-4 years sojourn in the UK. A Control group was also provided by 30 British-English native speakers. The 30 stimuli, derived from the online data of the Corpus study, were placed in a two-fold judgement task. The task was designed to: (1) test the participants‘ recognition of sarcasm within the given texts (threads) on a 7-point Likert scale, and (2) reveal what they consider as ‗sarcastic‘ within those texts by highlighting the potentially sarcastic part(s) in them. Results of the corpus study revealed that general pragmatic characteristics bear the greatest load in creating/indicating online sarcasm. Among these characteristics ‗Insincerity‘ seems to be the most fundamental or prototypical one. As for pragmalinguistic characteristics, they appear to play only a minor role in triggering and comprehending online sarcasm. ‗Hyperbole‘ seems to be the most prototypical one among pragmalinguistic characteristics. Regarding the L2 pragmatics study, ANOVA results reveal that both learners‘ groups are significantly different from English Native Speakers. Thus, Iraqi EFL learners appear not to have reached the native level of sarcasm perception. Results also indicate no effect of studying abroad or L2 proficiency upon the sarcasm recognition of those learners. Another finding of the L2 study is that the more characteristics (general pragmatic or pragmalinguistic) available the easier the comprehension of sarcasm turns out to be for both native speakers and learners. However, learners seem to be more sensitive to pragmalinguistic characteristics than English native speakers. They are found to identify sarcasm at the sight of these features more than the native speakers do. More interestingly, the current study has also found out that sarcasm does not always express a negative attitude. Sometimes, it can be used to express a positive emotion in a friendly way. This study encourages further research on L2 sarcasm, particularly with regard to the kind and amount of L2 input the learners are exposed to. It also focuses attention on the necessity of developing the learners‘ L2 pragmatic competence in general and their competence of L2 sarcasm in particular in order to bridge the gap between their performance and that of the native speakers.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/online-sarcasm-perception-second-language/docview/2473879198/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Abing, Jesse Lee",2018,Language Coaching for Speakers of Spanish as a Heritage Language: Novice-Expert Interactions via Videoconference,"This longitudinal study examines the potential of coach-learner interactions via videoconferencing technology to facilitate language use and development in interactions of Hispanic heritage university students learning Spanish. From a situated learning perspective (SLA) (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991), the act of learning is evidenced by one’s changed participation in discursive practices of sociocultural significance. Socially-situated studies analyzing the development of Interactional Competence (Hall, 1999; He &amp; Young, 1999) have found novice-expert interactions productive for SLA in both face-to-face (Yagi, 2007; Young &amp; Miller, 2004) and computer mediated (Lee, 2007) contexts. However, no studies have examined the development of HLLs in video conferenced novice-expert interactions. This multiple-case study uses a sociocognitive approach (Atkinson, Churchill, Nishino, &amp; Okada, 2007) to investigate changes in participation for six HLLs paired with a coach for approximately twelve 45-minute sessions over two months. Investigator, coach, and learner perspectives were triangulated for a holistic view of linguistic (e.g., interactional resources, use of English) and affective (e.g., comfort, self-confidence) development. Coaches assessed learners on an initial and final task-based (Willis, 1993) job interview roleplay activity, while the investigator’s analysis focused on change in participation vis-a-vis interactional competence in the opening portion of the initial and final task assessment sessions, where learners and coaches engage in spontaneous conversation before starting their task-based roleplay activity. In addition, learners’ perceptions of the experience and its impact were gathered in pre- and post-interviews and surveys. Overall, the outcomes of the situated practice resulted in changed participation related to a greater sense of comfort and confidence using the target language along with improved linguistic (e.g., fluency, vocabulary) and interactional (e.g., alignment activity) resources. The results of the analysis indicate that through recurrent, one-on-one interactions with the same person, the HLL and NS coach had the opportunity to deconstruct power dynamics and align more deeply as mutual interactors. At the beginning and at the end of the study, changes in mutual engagement were characterized by more highly coordinated turn-taking, increased interpersonal alignment and intersubjectivity, and improved conversational flow.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/language-coaching-speakers-spanish-as-heritage/docview/2473406857/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Martin, Ines A.",2018,Bridging the Gap Between L2 Pronunciation Research and Teaching: Using iCPRS to Improve Novice German Learners’ Pronunciation in Distance and Face-to-face Classrooms,"Communication in the target language is the main goal in most second language classrooms. Even though there is considerable evidence that pronunciation plays a crucial role in effective communication (Celce-Murcia et al., 2010), pronunciation training is frequently neglected in the foreign language classroom for reasons such as lack of classroom time or lack of instructor preparedness to teach pronunciation (Derwing, 2013; Grim &amp; Sturm, 2016; Foote et al., 2011). The present dissertation addresses this discrepancy by investigating the effectiveness of a homework-based method of pronunciation instruction for beginner learners that does not require teacher feedback or in-class time and thus allows for pronunciation training to be included in any second language (L2) curriculum. Through this method, called innovative Cued Pronunciation Readings (iCPRs; Martin, 2015, 2017, see also Tanner &amp; Landon, 2009), students receive pronunciation training in the form of Microsoft PowerPoint units that every learner can access from a home or library computer. Thus, this type of pronunciation training can be assigned as homework and students work on it alone. This allows for an implementation of pronunciation training in the curriculum without taking up valuable in-class time or requiring special skills from the instructor. Since pronunciation training via iCPRs can be delivered online, the method lends itself not only to use in face-to-face but also in distance (i.e. online) learning environments. The emergence of online and hybrid courses over the past two decades has presented new challenges as well as opportunities for language instruction. In particular, the development of learners’ oral proficiency in an online learning environment has been shown to be problematic (Deutschmann et al., 2009). In light of these developments, it is important to consider language instruction not only in traditional face-to-face environments but also in online learning environments. The present dissertation assessed the effectiveness of the iCPR method in on-campus and online learning environments by measuring novice German learners’ improvement in perception and production skills over the course of one semester. Data collection was conducted with 90 first-semester learners of German. In the face-to-face environment, each of the six sections of first semester German classes was pseudo-randomly assigned the status of treatment, comparison, or control group. Students in the treatment group received ten weeks of pronunciation training delivered through homework-based iCPR units, whereas students in the comparison group received ten weeks of ten minutes in-class pronunciation training delivered by their instructors. Finally, students in the control group followed the same standardized first-semester German lesson plans as the other two groups, but did not receive targeted pronunciation training. Since there is no in-class instruction in the online learning environment, there was no comparison group in this condition. Instead, four sections of online first-semester German classes were divided into two sections that served as a treatment group (i.e., a group that received instruction through iCPR units) and two sections that served as a control group. The study employed a pretest / posttest design: participants’ pronunciation was recorded in the 2nd and 14th week of the semester. The assessment included a binary-choice perception task and participants’ oral productions at the word and sentence level. Following standard procedure in pronunciation training research, these speech productions were rated by native German speakers for ease of comprehensibility and strength of accent. The ratings from each group were compared in order to assess the effectiveness of the different types of pronunciation training. For the face-to-face learning environment, results show that the learners in the treatment group, who received homework-based iCPR pronunciation training, significantly outperformed learners in the control group on measures of phonological perception skills, comprehensibility in productions of individual words, and accentedness in productions of individual words. Moreover, results reveal no significant difference between the learners who received homework-based pronunciation training and learners who received in-class pronunciation training. Together, these results suggest that learners benefit from iCPR pronunciation training and that homework-based pronunciation training is as effective in improving learners’ German perception and production skills as in-class pronunciation training. For the online learning environment, results show that the learners in the treatment group, who received iCPR pronunciation training as part of their online curriculum, significantly outperformed learners in the control group on all measures, that is, in phonological perception skills, in ease of comprehensibility in productions on the word- and paragraph-level, and in a diminished accent in productions on the word-and paragraph-level. These findings suggest that learners in an online environment benefit from iCPR pronunciation training. Taken together, this dissertation shows that effective pronunciation training can be provided outside the classroom via iCPRs, which saves valuable in-class time and opens up possibilities for learners to receive pronunciation instruction even in an online learning environment or if their instructor lacks the preparation to teach this topic. As such, this dissertation suggests a method of pronunciation instruction that addresses the problems that all too often lead to the neglect of pronunciation training in traditional classrooms and in online learning environments.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/bridging-gap-between-l2-pronunciation-research/docview/2449915724/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Flowers, Candice April Mary",2018,Backward Transfer of Apology Strategies from Japanese to English: Do English L1 Speakers Use Japanese-style Apologies when Speaking English?,"When learning a second language, there are elements of a learner's native language that can transfer and are exhibited during production in the second language. This can extend not only to the way things are said but even to gestures that are language- and speech-act-specific. However, there is evidence that the same can occur backwards, that is to say that elements of a second language can be exhibited during production of one's native language (Pavlenko and Jarvis, 2002). This study focuses on English L1 learners of Japanese who have spent significant time both in country and learning the language to see if they exhibit Japanese tendencies when performing apologies in their native English. Comparisons between those with no Japanese experience were made with those who had extensive Japanese experience. Through video recordings of 45 participants engaging in six apology-induced scenarios (non-Japanese, n=24; Japanese, n=21), the participants showed that backward transfer occurs with repetition of IFIDs and nonverbal cues. Further research through different methods can be more telling.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/backward-transfer-apology-strategies-japanese/docview/2442249235/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Young, Eric H.",2018,Promoting Second Language Learning Through Oral Asynchronous Computer-mediated Communication,"Learning to speak a foreign language (L2) can be a challenging feat, made all the more challenging when done in only 50 minute, daily increments in class. Oral asynchronous computer-mediated communication (ACMC) provides learners with opportunities to practice spoken communication and evaluate their practice outside the classroom. In this dissertation, I explore methods for classroom integration of oral ACMC, linguistic traits developed in previous oral ACMC studies, methods for determining the effectiveness of oral ACMC, learner beliefs about the effectiveness of oral ACMC activities, and the effects of learners' deliberate practice in a series of oral ACMC activities on 3 measures of L2 fluency. In my first article, a literature review, I found that most studies on this topic focus on the linguistic traits of accuracy, fluency, and pronunciation, and determine L2 growth from oral ACMC activities through learner perceptions of L2 growth not relying on objective measures. In my second article, I analyzed the fluency change of learners who participated in a series of video recording and feedback activities. I found that, although there were few significant results, the activities may be of some benefit to learners in improving their spoken fluency. I also found that structural equational modelling may be of more value for researching classroom-based activities than t tests and regression models. In my third article, I investigated the experiences of several learners who participated in the video recording activities described in article two. Based on these learner experiences, I provided key considerations for designing asynchronous video recording assignments. The three articles included in this dissertation will be valuable in highlighting key factors related to the design, development, research, and effective use of oral ACMC activities in foreign language classrooms.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/promoting-second-language-learning-through-oral/docview/2441565048/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Chen, Li-ying",2018,A Bi-directional Study of Request Strategies in Chinese and English,"The present study investigated the use of strategies by Taiwanese college students and English-speaking students in Taiwan in making Chinese and English request. Three factors affecting the subjects’ use of request strategies were examined: social power, social distance, and the degree of imposition. Different from previous research, the present study examined the subjects’ request behavior in their native and non-native languages. A total of twelve students from Taiwanese college students and twelve English-speaking students were recruited to complete two versions (i.e., Chinese and English) of an oral discourse completion task (ODCT). The major findings are summarized, as follows:1. In making Chinese request, the English subjects performed quite differently from the Chinese native speakers. However, the Chinese subjects and English native speakers employed strategies similarly in making English request.2. The Chinese group showed a similar tendency of using request strategies in their native (Chinese) and non-native language (English), while the English group differed greatly in Chinese and English request.3. With regard to the three factors affecting the use of request strategies, social distance was found more influential than social power and the degree of imposition in making Chinese request.4. The influence of the three factors was on a similar scale in the use of English request strategies.5. Regarding the use of combined strategies, both groups of subjects tended to combine MOOD and PREP with other strategies. Both NSC and NSE also used Type J (PREP plus PREP) the most frequently in Chinese and English.Keywords: second language acquisition, speech act, request, social power, socialdistance, the degree of imposition.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/bi-directional-study-request-strategies-chinese/docview/2350956470/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Darmawan, Jenny",2018,The Development of Tense and Aspect in English L2 in Chinese Older Migrants in Australia,"This study investigates the development of tense and aspect (TA) in English L2 in Chinese L1 older migrants in Australia within a Processability Theory (PT) (Pienemann, 1998). TA is expressed differently in Chinese and English: it is expressed through morphological and syntactic processes in English while in Chinese tense it is expressed lexically, and aspect via contextual cues and aspect markers, e.g., le (Xiao &amp; McEnery, 2004). These typological contrasts create learning difficulties among Chinese L1 learners in producing English TA (Wiedenhof, 2015). From a morph-syntactic viewpoint, PT hypothesises a universal sequence of L2 development where V-ing and V-ed are acquired at category-procedure stage, followed by verb phrase agreement between auxiliary and lexical verb at phrasal stage and finally marking of third person-singular on verb at S-procedure stage. The Aspect Hypothesis (AH) (Andersen &amp; Shirai, 1994; Shirai, 2002b; Shirai &amp; Andersen, 1995) on the other hand, claims that the acquisition of aspect is related to verb semantics and, for instance, acquisition of progressive V-ing starts with Activity verbs (e.g., walking) then extends to Accomplishment (e.g., completing) and Achievement verbs (e.g., reaching) (Shirai &amp; Andersen, 1995, p. 745). Further, in English L2, TA is acquired in the following order: Present progressive &gt; Simple past &gt; Past progressive &gt; Present perfect &gt; Past perfect. No study, so far, has investigated whether older migrants follow such developmental paths. Seven Chinese migrants in Australia, aged 60-69, participated in this study. They received four-week instruction on TA. Speech production data were collected before and after the instruction. Analyses indicate that the informants’ PT developmental stages and grammatical accuracy improved but with significant individual differences. Results also largely support AH. This study suggests that older learners are able to learn English TA through targeted training, and also provides empirical support to PT’s development trajectory among older learners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-tense-aspect-english-l2-chinese-older/docview/2228773919/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lee, Yue Christine",2018,Understanding the Identity Formation Process of CSL Learners: A Sociocultural Integrative Approach,"With China’s rapid growth and economic power, its language has gained popularity among non-Chinese speakers, and the demand for Chinese language education has increased. However, the increased interest in Chinese language education is not reflected in the amount of research conducted in the area of Chinese as a second language (CSL) and Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) (Kecskes, 2013). Furthermore, Duff et al. (2013) noted that most of the studies conducted in the area of CSL and CFL drew from a cognitive orientation and called for studies from a social perspective. In an attempt to fill this gap, the present study adopted an ethnographicallyoriented approach that aimed to study the relationship between language learning and identity construction. This 10-week ethnographic study that focused on three CSL learners at an Intensive Mandarin Learning program located in Northern Taiwan. The theoretical framework for this study was a sociocultural integrative approach that combined Vygotskian (1978) sociocultural theory and Schieffelin and Ochs’ (1986a, 1986b) language socialization theory, which sees one’s identity as developed through both co-construction in social interactions and active internalization. The research questions for the study are as follows: (1) What are the culturally produced artifacts (dialogue, concepts, belief systems, ideologies, etc.…) available in the environment that serve as either constraints or affordances to learners’ identity construction? (2) How identity is simultaneously formed through the learner’s active internalization of the cultural resources available in the environment and co-constructed with others in social interactions in the second language (L2) community? To provide insight into the research inquires, the study utilized Fairclough’s threetier critical discourse analysis (CDA), and adopted narrative-based analysis and thematic analysis from Josselson (2014) and Gibson and Brown (2011). Through the analysis of multiple sources of data including classroom observations, audio-recordings of classroom interactions, audio-recorded semi-structured interviews, and observational field notes, the study identified several cultural artifacts that had the potential to serve as symbolic means that form learners’ identity. However, not every cultural resource acted as a mediated tool. The study discovered three main available cultural resources that act as symbolic means and mediated language learners’ identities: the language ideologies developed in the teacher’s classroom instructions and interactions, the social interaction and dialogue with native speakers in various contexts, and learners’ personal history and life experience. In response to the second research question, one of the key findings in this study was that language learners can form their desired identities in one context, while in another context their identities may be contradictory to the desired identities. Another important finding was that native speakers beyond the classroom context often given the participants’ identities as language learners, and the second language learner identity could be simultaneously present with a contrasting identity. The other key finding was that language learner’s investment in the classroom activity could be maintained by their active renegotiation of the connection between the classroom activity and her desired identity. The study concluded by providing implications on L2 pedagogy that suggests teachers should recognize L2 learners’ language needs and desired identities. Teachers should also develop classroom activities that address L2 learners’ communicative needs, which would serve to develop their communicative competence in specific areas. Further, teachers should be aware of the language ideologies constructed in the classroom and allow room for negotiation of other possible linguistic ideologies that are present in the larger social world.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/understanding-identity-formation-process-csl/docview/2205679173/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shelton, Abigail Leigh",2018,Japanese Native Perceptions of the Facial Expressions of American Learners of L2 Japanese in Specified Contexts,"Grammatical errors in a foreign language point to us as bad speakers of the language, but pragmatic failures point to us as bad people (Thomas 1983). This is also true when using facial expressions in a second/foreign language (“L2”) or culture (“C2”). Facial expression research has revealed that while there are some cross-cultural universals in how we interpret certain facial expressions, whether we display, suppress, or even mask our facial expressions is governed by culture-specific conventions. Violations of these “display rules” (Ekman and Friesen 1969)—just like violations of pragmatic language strategies—can have unintended results. When American learners enter the L2 Japanese classroom, they are already armed with facial expression strategies associated and integrated with their L1. These strategies unconsciously translate into their performances in L2 Japanese, although the effects of such transfer have yet to be studied. To learn about the perceptions that Japanese natives have of the facial expressions of L2 speakers of Japanese, data were collected through an online survey from 30 Japanese women in Japan and the US. First, a Likert scale was used to measure the respondents' assessments of the naturalness and appropriateness of the L2 Japanese performances of four performers: one 1 st -year and one 2 nd -year American learner of Japanese; one advanced American speaker of Japanese; and one native speaker of Japanese. Next, a “select-all that apply” question was used to identify (i) which facial expressions the raters observed in each performance, and (ii) which of those observed were violations for the context. Finally, raters gave written feedback about the performances and how they could have been made more culturally appropriate. An ordinal regression revealed no statistically significant difference between the naturalness and appropriateness ratings, indicating that both are likely measuring aspects of the same behavioral construct. A Kruskal-Wallis H test revealed a statistically significant difference between the naturalness and appropriateness ratings of the beginner learners of Japanese and the advanced speaker (p=0.009), as well as between the advanced and native speakers (p=0.003). This finding suggests that either non-native speakers naturally acquire L2-appropriate facial expressions over time with exposure to the target culture, or that a higher language proficiency yields more appropriate facial expressions as learners become more comfortable speaking in Japanese. Either way, explicitly teaching and having learners perform these facial expressions could speed up the process of acquiring these facial expression skills. Another ordinal regression showed that raters' years of work experience in Japan had a weak positive effect on naturalness ratings. While it is unclear exactly what this means, it could indicate that the longer a Japanese native has lived in Japan, the more positively she is likely to view the facial expressions of American learners of Japanese. Finally, written feedback was analyzed using the grounded theory approach (Glaser and Strauss 1967). Several display conventions and the contextualization cues (Gumperz 1982) that triggered them were identified for each context. Future research could utilize these display conventions and see if learners can be taught to follow them in their L2 Japanese performances.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/japanese-native-perceptions-facial-expressions/docview/2202446578/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hamann, Mareike",2018,The Changing Grammatical Usage of Mimetics in Japanese,"Mimetics in Japanese comprise both onomatopoeic expressions (phonomimes) and other ideophones (phenomimes; psychomimes), which do not imitate acoustic phenomena. They can appear in various syntactic positions and adopt the syntactic functions of nouns in a referential phrase, predicates, attributes in a noun phrase and adverbs, with the latter being the most common usage. Since the stem of mimetic expressions such as SUTON (""thump""), KIRARI (""flash""), KYAAA (""Aaaah!"") or GAN-GAN (""pounding"") cannot be altered and common suffixes such as /N/, /RI/ and /Q/ (glottal stop) cannot be inflected, the syntactic function of mimetics in Japanese is determined by their position in the sentence and the particles (postpositions) used to indicate their function within a larger constituent. In colloquial speech, these particles may also be omitted, which sometimes results in the syntactic position being the only indicator of the syntactic function. However, when contrasting the grammatical usage of mimetics in data sources from various speech registers, it becomes apparent that not all mimetics are used with all particles and in all syntactic positions. Moreover, some mimetics may be combined with certain particles in idiomatic contexts, but would be used differently in spontaneous speech. For this reason, it is not surprising that opinions vary greatly when it comes to determining the distribution of individual mimetics, and mimetics as a class. This often results in L2 learners of Japanese being confused by contradictory statements in dictionaries and textbooks, which may not necessarily reflect the actual usage of mimetics in spoken Japanese and thus constitute an obstacle to effective language learning. The focus of this thesis is a description of the variable use of selected mimetics in attributive contexts, to shed light on the factors underlying the variation, and to establish whether a language change has been taking place in recent years. Empirical data collected from dictionaries, corpora, surveys and interviews shows that sociolinguistic factors such as gender, age and media exposure may influence the grammatical preferences of native speakers and their perception of mimetics. For this reason, both linguistic and extra-linguistic factors have to be taken into account in order to establish a grammatical framework for mimetics in Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/changing-grammatical-usage-mimetics-japanese/docview/2189804767/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Qian, Manman",2018,"An Adaptive Computational System for Automated, Learner-Customized Segmental Perception Training in Words and Sentences: Design, Implementation, Assessment","Segmental perception training is important as many phonemic errors are common in second language pronunciation and the perception of foreign phonemic contrasts is often difficult to acquire without instruction (Best &amp; Tyler, 2007; Birdsong, 1992, 2006; Flege, 1988, 1995). Numerous computer-assisted programs exist that provide training for segmental perception, but few of them have made effective use of already-existing language resources. There has been a call for the creation of a computer-assisted pronunciation teaching (CAPT) program that provides individualized needs-based training based on first language and learner proficiency (Levis, 2007; Munro, Derwing, &amp; Thomson, 2015). A perception training model is yet to be developed that takes into account the major components important to intelligibility, the use of technology, and the state-of-the-art research findings on perception training. Specifically, the ideal training model first needs to account for learners’ L1 backgrounds since L2 segmental errors are often L1-specific (Swan &amp; Smith, 2002). Second, the training model should also be tailored to individual needs as not everyone sharing the same L1 will certainly have the L1-predicted errors (Munro, 2018; Munro, Derwing, &amp; Thomson, 2015). Third, the functional load theory (King, 1967) suggests that not all phonemic errors affect intelligibility equally and that perception training should not target all errors as if they had an equal impact on intelligibility. Fourth, the training model should leverage a high-variability phonetic training design, defined as a technique of using multiple voice models for perception training (Pisoni &amp; Lively, 1995), which has been found to be efficacious in improving perception (Thomson, 2012; Wang &amp; Munro, 2004) as well as production (Thomson, 2011). This study introduces an innovative online perception training system that uses computational approaches to deliver high variability phonetic training designed to improve learners’ ability to discriminate and identify segmental contrasts. The system was designed with five major features. First, the system was developed with intelligibility-driven goals by only focusing on high functional load segmental errors. Second, the system offered training customized to individual learners’ pre-training diagnostic performance and then adapted the training content and intensity based on individual learners’ errors during real-time learning. Third, in recognition of the efficacy of multi-voice models for perception acquisition (Thomson, 2011, 2012; Wang &amp; Munro, 2004), the system utilized high-variability phonetic training exercises developed using two North American text-to-speech voices. Fourth, the training system was self-contained and could be accessed and used by learners flexibly and independently based on their own pace with little teacher guidance. Fifth, immediate individualized feedback was available on every item during training. In addition, the stimuli used for the training system were automatically extracted from a phonetically transcribed dictionary with word frequency controlled. Specifically, only words among the top 5,000 lemmas in the Contemporary Corpus and American English were selected by the system to ensure that all the training and test stimuli were likely to be familiar to the participants in the study so that they would be able to recognize the stimuli aurally during perception tests and training without seeing the words spelled out. Four types of exercises created with text-to-speech minimal pairs, automatically extracted from the Illinois Speech and Language Engineering Dictionary, were used for training. The training exercises came in four types: same-different discrimination, oddity discrimination, simple identification, and yes/no identification. The voices and words of the training stimuli were controlled for in order to examine the learners’ potential transfer of perception gains to three novel conditions: to trained words spoken with untrained voices, to untrained words spoken with trained voices, and to trained items in sentences. The training system was used for approximately three months by 266 Chinese-L1 English majors from three universities located in three cities (Harbin, Soochow, and Guangzhou). The learners were placed into either an experimental group or a control group based on their institution, and used the system for perception training on nine English consonant and vowel contrasts that were predicted to be challenging for the learners. An analysis of the participants’ diagnostic and training performance revealed substantial variation among the learners’ actual segmental errors and pace of learning. This suggests that L2 phonemic acquisition is not merely L1-specific or dialect-specific but is a process distinctive to individual learners but that was not correlated with time on training, highlighting the importance of incorporating adaptability in the design and delivery of pronunciation training materials. Descriptive and inferential statistics on training effect, retention and transfer of test gains showed that an average of 143 minutes of focused effort led to robust improvement and retention of phonemic perception for most of the segmental contrasts under investigation.

"Sunara, Simona",2018,Effects of Explicit Instruction and Corrective Feedback on the Acquisition of the French Accentual Phrase by Native Speakers of English,"It is now well recognized that second language (L2) instruction and corrective feedback (CF) have significant positive effects on the acquisition of L2 pronunciation (e.g., Saito, 2012; Derwing &amp; Munro, 2015; Lee, Jang &amp; Plonsky, 2015; Thomson &amp; Derwing, 2015). The objective of the present dissertation is to further our understanding of the effects of explicit instruction and CF via the study of the acquisition of the French Accentual Phrase (AP), a primary unit of prosodic organization, by native speakers of English. To this end, two inter-related experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 involved ten English-speaking learners of French who completed word recognition and delayed elicited imitation tasks that assessed their accuracy in the perception and production of APs, respectively. In perception, these learners showed limited accuracy with respect to the increased pitch and duration that cue AP-final syllables in French. In production, they produced too many, insufficiently large APs, and were non-target-like in the phonetic realization of the final LH* rise that signals the final full syllable of this prosodic unit. Experiment 2 then examined whether an instructional treatment that targeted the difficulties identified in Experiment 1 could increase learners’ accuracy in perception and production. Eight English-speaking learners of French were provided with six hours of explicit instruction and CF. Gains in perception and production accuracy were assessed using a pre-/post-test design involving the same tasks as in Experiment 1. While the treatment did not lead to gains in perceptual accuracy with the final LH* rise, there was significant improvement in learners’ production of appropriately sized APs and of the final LH* rise. In summary, this dissertation contributes to the growing literature on L2 pronunciation instruction via the study of a previously unstudied prosodic structure in a relatively understudied target language, French, and demonstrates the potential benefits of explicit instruction including CF on L2 phonological and phonetic development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-explicit-instruction-corrective-feedback/docview/2156663882/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shintaku, Kayo",2018,Literacy Practices with Media: Popular Culture Media and the Role of Pedagogical Guidance in L2 Learning of Japanese,"Advancement of digital technologies has increased the accessibility of authentic resources in various languages, and this wide and easy access to authentic resources supports exposure to and interaction with second and foreign language (L2) and communities online. As the objective of learning is also shifting from what people learn to how people learn (Jenkins, 2009), the digitally-mediated communication landscape is radically reshaping the terrain of language and literacy education (Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2011; Lotherington &amp; Jenson, 2011). In this way, digital technologies add alternative channels and options for communication. Because digital technologies are multimodal by nature, they allow us to integrate multiple facets of literacy to communicate by using many modalities to make meaning (New London Group, 1996; Thorne &amp; Reinhardt, 2008). Consequently, expanded views of text and literacy (Kern, 2000, 2003) have been emphasized in the literature in order to holistically integrate multiple literacies into L2 education. Regarding Japanese-as-a-foreign language (JFL) education in particular, entertainment media, such as anime, digital games, and manga, often serve entry points into formal course-based language learning (Japan Foundation, 2014, 2017b; Mori &amp; Mori, 2011). In addition, JFL learners use increasingly-available educational media, such as language apps like Google Translate and language websites like Jisho.org. However, the existing body of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) literature has not fully investigated the use of entertainment media as part of formal course study to enhance authenticity and provide more literacy practices in the wild (Thorne, 2010). In this way, it is critical to understand how digital literacies are integral to the autonomous and self-directed learning at the learner’s level before curricular and class level implementation is even considered. The current research investigates what digital literacies that JFL learners are exposed to and employ in their autonomous and self-directed JFL learning using entertainment media (i.e., anime and digital games) and educational media (e.g., language apps). The data analyzed were collected from 12 JFL learners divided into two projects (anime and games focus groups) and from online survey responses from JFL learners enrolled in the Japanese language program ( n = 191) and students enrolled in the Anime Class ( n = 104) at the University of Arizona. In the first project, anime focus group (AFG) participants ( n = 6) watched three titles of anime and self-studied with four available language setting options. In the second project, game focus group (GFG) participants ( n = 6) played one single-player online game individually and one single-player PlayStation3 game as two sub-groups ( n = 2, n = 3) and solo ( n = 1). Both focus groups then participated in an interview at the end of the study. The findings from the AFG project showed that a digital environment promoted digital literacies and individuality in autonomous and self-directed learning. They also displayed the capacity of anime to make space for linguistic and cultural learning opportunities and provide reinforcement of learning by connecting inside- and outside-of-class learning. The findings from the GFG project demonstrated that JFL learners viewed games as milestones of achievement in their educational pathways. They also personalized learning strategies by utilizing various educational media to learn with games. Furthermore, the results demonstrated learner autonomy by controlling their learning process and the learner’s awareness as a member of community of practice. The analyzed data exhibited that JFL learners shared their expertise and learned from one another via group gameplay based on the reported ZPD and scaffolding moments. Built on those two projects, the research explores pedagogical implications for anime and digital games in both formal learning and autonomous and self-directed learning settings. The online survey results also evidenced the relationship between entertainment media consumption and formal language course enrollment. The current research contributes to a further understanding of outside literacies practiced by JFL learners via entertainment and educational media. The research is also potentially significant in its exploration of CALL-based L2 instructional designs not only in JFL but also in other L2 pedagogy taking place in contemporary digital spaces.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/literacy-practices-with-media-popular-culture/docview/2153776088/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Alzahrani, Fahad Ali",2018,Pragmatic Developmental Pathways by Saudi Learners of English During Study Abroad,"Recently, it has become increasingly popular among Saudi students to study abroad. There are, for example, currently 58,726 Saudi students studying at the university level in the United States. During their study abroad (SA) journey, when they wish to say something to someone, they need to determine the situationally-appropriate utterances: What can be said, to whom, where, when, and how. From the interlanguage pragmatic (ILP) perspective, the SA context is assumed to provide more opportunities to communicate with native speakers, and these opportunities are believed to lead to pragmatic gains (Kinginger, 2008, 2009). Guided by five research questions, this study investigated the development of pragmatic competence among Saudi second language (L2) learners of English during their SA experiences in the United States. The main areas of investigation in this study are: 1) assessing three aspects of pragmatic competence ––pragmatic appropriateness judgment “perception”, production, and comprehension with a focus on the speech acts of request, refusal and apology as well as implicature and 2) exploring the pragmatic developmental pathways of how their pragmatic competence develops while studying abroad in the United States. The study utilized an explanatory sequential mixed method design, with a quantitative phase followed by a qualitative phase. Seventy Saudi L2 students completed three pragmatic measures, namely, multiple-choice-discourse completion test (MDCT), written completion test (WDCT), and implicature listening test (ILT) that were administered electronically through a software for gathering data called Qualtrics . This was followed by semi-structured interviews with a sample of eight students who participated in the quantitative phase of the research. Several major findings were uncovered. In phase one, findings revealed that Saudi L2 learners were relatively competent in identifying, producing, and understanding appropriate language in contexts. Interview data suggested that there is a need to have a broader focus in language learning, including, beside grammar structure and vocabulary accuracy, the considerations of speech appropriateness and the different cultural issues. The interview data also discussed the participants’ acquisitional and developmental pathways of pragmatic competence as well as the sources they utilized to gain and develop their pragmatic competence in the SA context. Finally, the study concluded that almost all participants perceived SA in the native country to be helpful for developing pragmatic skills.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/pragmatic-developmental-pathways-saudi-learners/docview/2114885751/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Putra, Kristian Adi",2018,"Youth, Technology and Indigenous Language Revitalization in Indonesia","The three studies in this dissertation were carried out with the intention of showing how Indigenous communities in critically endangered language settings can “bring their language forward” (Hornberger, 2008) by encouraging Indigenous youth participation and integrating technology into Indigenous language revitalization efforts in and out of educational settings. Indigenous youth play a pivotal role in determining the future of their languages (McCarty, et. al, 2009). However, youth are often situated in contexts where they no longer have adequate supports to learn and use their Indigenous languages (Lee, 2009; McCarty, et.al, 2006; Romero-Little, et.al, 2007; Wyman et al, 2013) and Indigenous languages are continuously marginalized and unequally contested by other dominant languages (Tupas, 2015; Zentz, 2017). The study within was situated in a multilingual and multicultural urban area in Indonesia marked by complex dynamics of language shift and endangerment in and out of school settings, where the teaching of Indigenous language at school was managed by the local government and limited as a subject to two hours a week. However, the study also documented multiple existing and potential resources for language revitalization, and demonstrated possibilities for building language revitalization efforts on youth language activism and the availability of technology in and out of schools. In the first study, I examined the implementation of Lampung teaching in schools in Bandar Lampung, looking at the outcomes, challenges, and achievements of existing programs, and available resources for further developing and improving the programs. In the second study, I present ethnographic vignettes of three Indigenous youth and young adult language activists from three different Indigenous communities in Indonesia, highlighting how study participants initiated wide-ranging language activist efforts, and suggested new ways to encourage other youth to participate in Indigenous language revitalization. In the third study, I invited eight young adult language activists to share their stories of language activism with students in three Lampung language classrooms in Bandar Lampung, Indonesia, and help facilitate students’ Lampung language learning and use in online spaces together with Lampung language teachers. In the three studies, I triangulated quantitative data from sociolinguistic surveys and writing and speaking tests with qualitative data from interviews, focus group discussions, observations and documentation of language use in on and offline contexts. Overall findings from the three studies show how positioning youth and young adults as a resource (Wyman, et. al, 2016), and building on young peoples’ engagement with contemporary technology as a tool (Thorne &amp; Reinhardt, 2008; Reinhardt &amp; Thorne, 2017), can help youth learn, use and advocate for their Indigenous languages, offering hope for supporting language vitality in the future. Findings also demonstrate the potential for top down and bottom up language planning initiatives (Hornberger, 2005) to support youth Indigenous language learning and use beyond classroom settings, and encourage youth participation in community efforts to reverse language shift.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/youth-technology-indigenous-language/docview/2109028595/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Menjo, Shigehito",2018,The Development of L2 Prosody in Japanese Speakers of English: A Quasi-Longitudinal Study,"In this dissertation, I present the development of English prosody use in production and perception tasks by native Japanese speakers of English (JPs). Previous studies have shown that prosody is a crucial component in verbal interactions (Pickering, 2001) and affects comprehensibility, fluency, and accentedness (Kang, O., 2010; Trofimovich &amp; Baker, 2006). However, a smaller number of studies has been conducted in understanding the development of English prosody use by JPs over time and what factors may affect the development of their production and perception of prosodic features. Considering this gap, I examined English prosody manipulation by JPs over time using a mixed quasi-longitudinal research design with the emphasis on quantitative analysis. The participants included 31 native speakers of English (NSs) as a control group (Male = 8, Female = 23) and 93 JPs with 3 different proficiency levels (Male = 41, Female = 52) that were based on their length of residence in the United States with age of arrival held consistent. The participants completed 2 production tasks and 1 perception task. For the production tasks, 2 data-eliciting techniques were used: a read–aloud protocol and a spontaneous speech. For the perception task, the Profiling Elements of Prosody in Speech- Communication (PEPS-C; Peppé &amp; McCann, 2003) software was used. The production data sets were analyzed auditorily and instrumentally, and pause measurements, rate measurements, stress measurements, and intonation (Kang, O., &amp; Pickering, 2011) were examined. The data sets of both the production and perception tasks were statistically analyzed. The results of statistical analyses for the production tasks indicated that a combination of prominence characteristics strongly discriminated between the speaker groups. The results also showed that the production of tone, rate, and stress measures were other significant factors that discriminated between the speaker groups. The results for the perception task showed that none of the JPs met the NSs in perceiving interpersonal and informationally marked intonation patterns. In conclusion, the overall results indicated that length of residence partially accounts for the development of a second language (L2) prosody performance and that socially constructed prosodic cues should be taught explicitly in the classroom. They also indicated that more attention should be given to perception in L2 prosody acquisition as Flege (1995) claimed that accurate perception leads to accurate production.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-l2-prosody-japanese-speakers-english/docview/2103180418/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"DuBois, Stefan Karsten",2019,Are L2 Speakers Allowed to Use Colloquialisms? L1 Attitudes Toward Spanish L2 Speakers' Use of Informal Lexical Items,"Extensive literature demonstrates that, with extended contact and high integrative motivation, L2 speakers gradually acquire L2 nonstandard variation over time as a result of interaction with speakers of the target language (Dewaele &amp; Regan 2001, Dewaele 2002, Nagy et al. 2003, Raish 2015, Salgado-Robles 2011). Yet, some learners fear that adopting nonstandard variation would be inauthentic (Kinginger and Farrell 2004, Ringer-Hilfinger 2012, Trosset 1986), and various pedagogical models and scholarly works advocate against the dangers of overaccommodation, arguing that native speakers expect language learners to set a linguistic target more socially prestigious than the vernacular common to the L1 community (Andreasson 1994, Auger &amp; Valdman 1999, Christophersen 1973, Saville-Troike 2003, Valdman 1988). The question of how native speakers perceive L2 use of nonstandard variation has received little attention in terms of empirical studies, and results have been conflicting among the few works which have investigated the issue. Some have found that L1 speakers respond negatively to such language use (Prodromou 2007, Ruivivar &amp; Collins 2018, Swacker 1976) while others indicate the opposite (Beaulieu 2016; George 2013, 2014, 2017). The present study sought to clarify these conflicting findings by investigating the attitudes of L1 speakers of Peninsular Spanish to the use of colloquial lexical items by L1 speakers of English. The study utilized a matched guise methodology (Lambert et al. 1960), asking over 200 participants to evaluate audio samples of L1 and L2 speakers using colloquial language which was selected according to a corpus analysis of Peninsular Spanish. Participants assessed the speakers according to factors such as linguistic proficiency, the appropriateness of language use according to context, and personality traits corresponding with the dimensions of status, solidarity, and dynamism common to language attitudes research (Giles &amp; Billings 2004, Zahn &amp; Hopper 1985). The results of the study found that the use of colloquial language did not quantitatively correlate with significantly higher or lower measures of linguistic proficiency on a broad level, despite its use being highly salient to participants. In terms of measures of contextual appropriateness and personality ratings, the study found that L2 speakers experience many of the same disadvantages suffered by native speakers when using nonstandard language—for example, being downgraded on personality characteristics associated with status (successful, intelligent, etc.)—but they do not have the same level of access to corresponding advantages, such as increased ratings of traits indicating solidarity (sociable, friendly, etc.). While these results verify to some degree the existence of a double standard in attitudes toward nonstandard language use according to the speaker’s L1, the lack of concrete benefits available to L2 speakers using colloquial language constituted a bigger drawback than any outright negative associations made with its use; what negative associations did exist were by and large those experienced by L1 speakers, and these were not so negative as to justify theoretical arguments in the literature advocating the wholesale avoidance of its production. Instead, the results of this study suggest that so long as L2 users are aware of the potential risks associated with using such language, there seems to be no reason to discourage its production.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/are-l2-speakers-allowed-use-colloquialisms-l1/docview/2299815946/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Martin, Alexandra",2018,"How to Synchronize? A Study of Video-Based, Voice-Based & Text Based Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication, Working Memory, and Second Language Learning","The growing presence of Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication (SCMC), defined as ‘real-time, synchronous conversation that takes place online’ (Baralt &amp; Leow, 2016, p. 200), via video-chat programs such as Skype in online language courses has been documented in the literature (Ziegler, 2016c). While research up to now has shown that text -based SCMC impacts positively on second language (L2) learning, the effects of video - and voice -based SCMC still need to undergo a formal investigation as a means for effective L2 instruction. On the other hand, the role of working memory capacity (WMC) in the SCMC mode has begun to be explored in previous research but only for text-based SCMC, whereas oral SCMC has yet to be addressed. Using a controlled experimental design, the current dissertation helps fill these gaps in the literature by investigating the potential of these three SCMC modes (text-based, voice-based, and video-based) to promote L2 Spanish grammatical learning. Additionally, it addresses whether WMC mediates the effects of mode for L2 learning. Sixty-five intermediate L2 Spanish learners completed an interactive task in one of these three environments that targeted the learning of Spanish past subjunctive, a complex structure thought to be difficult to learn for L2 learners of Spanish (e.g., Collentine, 2010). Grammatical learning was assessed via pre-, post, and delayed posttest of written and oral production. Results from a series of several repeated-measures ANOVAS, ANCOVAS, and correlational analyses indicate that participants in the three SCMC modes learned the past subjunctive and many retained that learning one week after the treatment, and that this learning was not significantly different across groups. No effects were observed for WMC, indicating that participants across the WMC spectrum successfully achieved grammatical learning under the given explicit experimental conditions. Finally, participants in the text-based group took a significantly longer time to complete the task than the other two groups, although they needed significantly fewer feedback episodes than participants in the voice-based group to achieve similar rates of learning. These findings point to the importance of designing theoretically motivated learning tasks that can promote meaningful interaction in written and oral SCMC environments for L2 grammatical learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/how-synchronize-study-video-based-voice-amp-text/docview/2093905623/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Choi, Jung Eun",2019,"The Syntax-Pragmatics Interface in L2 Acquisition of Korean Case, Topic and Focus Particles","This dissertation investigates how adult second language (L2) learners of Korean attain the knowledge and use of four Korean particles, – i/ka ‘NOM’, - (l)ul ‘ACC’, - (n)un ‘TOP’, and – to ‘also/even’. All of these particles indicate the distinct pragmatic roles that noun phrases play in a given context. Therefore, L2 learners need to acquire the knowledge of pragmatic properties each particle is associated with in order to use them in a native-like way. In the first half of the dissertation, I characterize the four particles appealing to various semantico-pragmatic properties, and hypothesize that the computational load induced by such properties cause difficulty in the L2 acquisition of the four particles. In the latter half, I report an experimental study that tests this hypothesis. It also examines whether various aspects of learners’ first language (L1) would hinder or facilitate the acquisition of the four particles. In the experiment, a total of 130 participants (50 Chinese-speaking and 52 English-speaking learners at four proficiency levels and 28 native Korean-speaking controls) performed the forced-choice task, the acceptability task and the interpretation task. The results confirmed that the heavier computational load induced by the semantico-pragmatic property of the particle, the more difficult the acquisition of the particle. The results also indicated that approximate lexical encoding in L1 English did not facilitate the acquisition of the case particles in Korean, and that syntactic expression of topic in L1 Chinese helped the acquisition of generic topic marking, but it did not facilitate the acquisition of anaphoric or contrastive topic marking. Additionally, the results suggested that, due to L1 transfer, the additive focus particle - to was initially analyzed as an adverbial by Chinese-speaking and English-speaking learners, but its usage as an adnominal suffix was gradually acquired as the learners' proficiency level increased, and that lexical transfer facilitated scalar implicature computation, while lexical gaps caused difficulties. The dissertation sheds light on the nature of the L2 learning problems with respect to the four Korean particles, – i/ka ‘NOM’, - (l)ul ‘ACC’, - (n)un ‘TOP’, and – to ‘also/even’.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/syntax-pragmatics-interface-l2-acquisition-korean/docview/2305192482/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Monfaredi, Elham",2019,Occasioned Storytelling in Persian Language Classrooms,"The use of stories as pedagogical tools in second language (L2) classrooms has a longstanding research tradition (e.g., Huang, 2006; Inal &amp; Cakir, 2014). In these studies, stories are deployed as prepackaged instructional tools that are incorporated into lesson plans and embedded in the overall pedagogical concept. However, the ways in which stories figure as naturally occurring activities in L2 classroom interaction remains an understudied research topic. This investigation utilizes a conversation analytic approach in which storytelling is viewed as a social, situated activity that is locally occasioned, collaboratively accomplished, and interactionally consequential. Specifically, the study examines how impromptu stories unfold during ongoing instructional activities and what actions they accomplish in L2 classroom settings. The data come from 37 hours of videorecorded intermediate and advanced Persian classes at two North American universities. For analysis, multimodal conversation analysis (Mondada, 2014) and membership categorization analysis (Sacks, 1972; Fitzgerald &amp; Housley, 2015; Hester &amp; Eglin, 1997) are combined to examine the sequential and categorial production of stories told by teachers and students. In the corpus of stories told by the teachers, stories are launched in first position to exemplify, elaborate, or extend upon the ongoing pedagogical project, and in second position to provide counter examples and accounts, or to reject or accept students’ proposals. In contrast, students’ stories begin in responsive positions to accomplish actions such as giving accounts and bringing their cultural competencies and membership knowledge to the forefront. The findings also demonstrate that stories typically orient to the current pedagogical agenda or accomplish a particular instructional action. The study enhances applied linguistic knowledge about storytelling as a social practice in ongoing classroom interaction and thus contributes to the large field of second language classroom research. It also contributes to the scant research literature on instruction in Persian as a foreign language and begins to place pedagogical practice in the teaching of Persian on an empirical footing.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/occasioned-storytelling-persian-language/docview/2316417912/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ko, Wei-Hong",2020,Developing Pragmatic Competence in Game-Mediated Space: The Case of World of Warcraft,"This dissertation consisted of two inter-related studies examining second language (L2) learners’ development of pragmatic competence in game-mediated communication contexts. Research has shown that multiplayer online role-playing (MMORPG) games such as World of Warcraft (WoW) and Guild Wars 2 afford opportunities for improving L2 learners’ linguistic competence such as vocabulary learning and translanguaging practices. However, there is a relative lack of studies focusing on L2 pragmatics and game-mediated communication. Study 1 examined whether L2 learners raised their pragmatic competence through a three-month immersion in WoW whereas study 2 investigated learners’ engagement patterns in gameplay (i.e., whether they focused on gameplay or language learning) and the effects of these patterns on their pragmatic proficiency. Seven learners (4 males, 3 females) with two first language backgrounds (i.e., Chinese and Hindi) and two male native English speaking (NES) players were recruited from a large Midwestern University. Another group of eighteen participants with similar backgrounds served as a control group. The experimental group learners were paired with two NES players and were assigned to form two teams with a combination of novice and expert players. Experimental group participants completed a pre-posttest discourse completion task (DCT) containing tasks eliciting speech act production and played WoW together for three months. Control group participants also completed the pre-posttest DCT for comparison purpose. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore learners’ perception of gameplay and language learning. Pre-posttest comparison revealed the participants in the experimental group outperformed their counterparts in the control group. In addition, analysis of chat transcripts showed participants employed a variety of speech acts such as requests, suggestions, compliments and complaints. Results also showed some players made significant progress in making appropriate communicative activities such as orientation to others’ needs (e.g., appropriate conversational openings and closings) and facilitation of gameplay (e.g., appropriate request strategies) due to affordances for constant communication between other NNES players as well as NES player provided by the WoW game setting. Participants also improved in their oral speech act production as the number of conversational turns and number of words decreased across the three month timespan. Interview results indicated three major themes in facilitating or limiting players’ pragmatic development, including 1. NES players as language guides 2. Game expertise mediates language learning and 3. Motivation and perceived team dynamics mediate language learning. Overall, this study found participants employed different types of speech acts in their in-game communication and some participants showed pragmatic development through opportunities for interaction and collaboration the game design provided.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/developing-pragmatic-competence-game-mediated/docview/2678459509/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Sun, Tongle",2020,Second Language Identities and Socialization during Study Abroad: Chinese STEM International Exchange Students in an English-Speaking Country,"Underpinned by poststructuralist notions of identity (e.g., Block, 2007; Norton, 2013) and second language (L2) socialization (e.g., Duff, 2007, 2019; Jackson, 2018), this study investigated the language, identities, and intercultural learning of Mainland Chinese STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) students from a Hong Kong university who participated in a semester-long international exchange program in an English-speaking country. Adopting a multiple case study design, this investigation tracked the developmental trajectories of three focal case participants before, during, and until six months after their study abroad (SA) experience. International exchange questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interview protocols, monthly email prompts, multimodal entries, and a research journal were employed as data collection instruments. Data was gathered from April 2017 till July 2018 in the following phases: pre-sojourn, sojourn, immediate post-sojourn, and six-month postsojourn. NVivo 11 Pro, a qualitative software tool, assisted the data organization and analysis. Triangulation of the mixed-method, longitudinal data (e.g., questionnaire surveys, in-depth interview transcripts, email reflections, multimodal entries) revealed divergent developmental trajectories among the participants. While a few actively ii sought opportunities for L2/intercultural engagement in the host environment and experienced identity expansion (e.g., developed a more open, inclusive self), most did not fully act on the language and intercultural affordances in the host community and had limited gains. A cross-case analysis identified a complex mix of internal factors (e.g., agency, motivation) and external variables (e.g., host receptivity, housing situation) that appeared to influence the participants’ language, identity expansion, and intercultural learning. The findings raise awareness of the complex, idiosyncratic nature of SA and the challenges facing STEM students who participate in an international exchange program. The study has both theoretical and pedagogical implications. It enriches the existing body of literature on language and intercultural learning through SA, with a particular focus on the international educational experience of STEM students. In addition to helping us to better understand the complexity and individuality of SA, the study further debunks the ‘myth’ about the automatic transformation of SA students simply by being present in the host environment. Drawing on the findings, a conceptual model was developed to illustrate the multifarious variables that can influence the L2 identities and socialization of STEM SA students. In addition to theory-building, the findings provide valuable direction for pedagogical interventions for both sending and receiving institutions. Suggestions are offered to optimize student learning throughout the full SA cycle (e.g., pre-departure preparation, ongoing sojourn support, reentry debriefing). Thus, the findings of the study have implications for future SA STEM students, STEM educators, SA educators/mentors, program administrators/coordinators, and language and intercultural communication instructors, as well as other relevant stakeholders (e.g., international office staff, program initiators, policymakers) in the international education sector. While the study focused on the SA journeys of Mainland Chinese STEM undergraduates from a Hong Kong university, the recommendations are apt to be relevant to SA STEM students in other contexts. Many of the suggestions should also be applicable to the enhancement of the international educational experience of students in other disciplines.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-identities-socialization-during/docview/2605221178/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Wang, Qian",2020,"The Intelligibility, Comprehensibility, and Acceptability of China English: An Investigation of the Effects of Segmental and Suprasegmental Features","In today’s globalized world, where English is increasingly used by speakers from different language backgrounds as a lingua franca, a growing number of new English varieties are emerging in different parts of the world. China English (CE), as one of the fastest-growing varieties of English with the largest number of speakers, has been attracting a great deal of attention in recent years.&#xa0; The present study examines three interrelated constructs that underlie the development of CE as a new English variety: intelligibility, comprehensibility, and acceptability. Two interconnected phases were included in this study: a production study that aims to identify the distinctive phonological features of CE at both segmental and suprasegmental levels and a perception study that examines how different phonological features contribute to the three perceptual constructs of CE mentioned above. Results from this study provide acoustic evidence to support previous impressionistic observations of CE phonology, such as the neutralization of vowel contrasts, centralization of vowel space, syllable-timed rhythm, absence of unstressed syllables, and slow speech rate. Auditory analyses also reveal some distinctive features of CE, including the substitution of TH sounds, omission and vocalization of dark /l/, varied pronunciation of /ʒ/, and absence of voicing of word-final voiced sounds. Moreover, the segmental and suprasegmental features that affect intelligibility, comprehensibility, and acceptability of CE were identified through both statistical analysis and manual verification. In order to examine the effects of task type and language background of the listeners on their perceptions of CE, listeners from different language backgrounds (i.e., Kachru’s three concentric circles, mainland China, and Indonesia) were included for each of the listening tasks used in this study (i.e., word identification, cloze test, and word-for-word transcription). The results show that mainland Chinese (ML) listeners achieved significantly higher intelligibility scores than the other four listener groups, which confirms the beneficial effect of the shared native language. Inner-Circle (IC) listeners did not have a statistically higher intelligibility score than other non-Chinese groups, which suggests that native listeners are not necessarily the best judges of non-native speech. Additionally, there is a significant difference in listeners’ intelligibility scores between the four listening tasks. All of the listeners achieved 90 percent or above in the transcription task of the conversational interview, which is significantly higher than those in the cloze task and word identification task in which minimal pairs were used, and context is unavailable. This finding provides some evidence showing that contextual information in real communication settings do facilitate listeners’ understanding to a great extent even if the speakers carry some distinctive features that are different from IC English varieties.&#xa0; From a pedagogical perspective, this study sheds light on the learning and teaching of spoken English in China. The findings provide a basis for teachers and curriculum designers in China to revise and develop new English curricula in the globalized world by prioritizing the pronunciation components that are of primary importance for learners to be understood by speakers of other varieties of English. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the development of CE as a widely accepted English variety and lead to a better understanding of the relationship between the pronunciation features of CE and listeners’ perceptions of CE.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/intelligibility-comprehensibility-acceptability/docview/2570367504/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Hamada, Masumi",2020,Exploration of an Effective Way of Teaching the Aspect Marker -<em>tei</em>(<em>ru</em>) to Learners of Japanese Adopting a Cognitive Linguistics Approach,"This dissertation explores a new way to teach the use of the Japanese aspect marker - tei ( ru ) which occurs in various aspectual contexts (e.g. progressive, resultative, and perfective), to learners of Japanese by adopting a Cognitive Linguistics approach advocated by scholars like Langacker (2008), Lakoff (1987), Tayler (2003), Boers &amp; Lindstromberg (2006), Niemeier, (2008), Tyler (2012), etc. A general finding of previous L2 studies that examined the acquisition order of the progressive and the resultative use of this aspectual marker (e.g. Sheu, 1997; Shirai &amp; Kurono, 1998; Sugaya &amp; Shirai, 2007) is that learners have more difficulties in learning the resultative use over the progressive use. I argue that one source for this reported difficulty may come from the way - tei ( ru ) is conventionally introduced in many textbooks. This dissertation holds the view that the aspectual meanings associated with - tei ( ru ) belong to a super-category “continuity”, and within this super-category they themselves form sub-categories which are linked with each other. Based on these assumptions, a new CL-based method of teaching - tei ( ru ) is developed, in which - tei ( ru ) is introduced as a “continuity” marker and the resultative is used as the exemplar, anticipating that learners can generalize the use of - tei ( ru ) to other aspectual contexts.	 A quasi-experimental study was conducted involving two groups of learners: one group received the CL-based instruction and the other group a conventional textbook-based instruction. Two research questions were addressed (i) whether the CL-based instruction is indeed effective and (ii) whether the effect of the CL-based instruction of one usage allows learners to go beyond that usage and facilitate or support the learning of other usages. The results show that the CL-based instruction is more effective than the conventional instruction for teaching resultative - tei ( ru ), and that the benefit of the CL-based instruction did extend beyond the original usage covered.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploration-effective-way-teaching-aspect-marker/docview/2492315426/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ikeda, Maiko",2020,Conversation in CMC: Tracing Novice Agency from a Language Socialization Perspective,"This dissertation examines how second language (L2) Japanese language learners exercise their agency in the language learning process in and how that use impacts their development of pragmatic competence within the language socialization (LS) process, with specific focus on selection and usage of sentence ending speech styles through online interactions with native Japanese university students. While the originators of LS carefully conceptualized the LS process as contingent, fluid, unpredictable, contested, and bidirectional (or multidirectional), the pioneer studies of LS have focused on how children and novices are socialized by their caregivers and experts. Consequently, this focus has created misunderstanding that LS emphasizes the reproduction of language, from expert to novice, as a successful and smooth process, where novices are mere passive receivers of knowledge from experts in order to functionally participate in the practices of their target communities. This complex process in which novices ratify, reject, and negotiate has to do with their agency, yet what novice agency is and its implication in the LS process has yet to be examined at any depth due to this narrower interpretation of LS. The present study responds to these challenges by examining how Japanese language learners develop competence to effectively and meaningfully participate in online class activities with native speaker university students over three months by analyzing both learners’ and native speakers’ agentive usage of Japanese sentence ending speech styles. To understand the process of their pragmatic competence development, this study quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes learners’ usage of speech style throughout the online activities in conjunction to semi-structured interviews with participants discussing their pragmatic choices in the data. The analysis on speech style usage shows learners of Japanese exert agency in a v multitude of ways within online interaction with their partnered native Japanese university students through selection of speech style, including strategies such as: shifting speech styles to initiate new context creation, persistent usage of a selected speech style that differs from that of native speaker’s and/or adoption of speech styles in relative synchronicity to native speakers’ selections. These findings indicate that not only do learners agentively select speech style, but also that such agency plays a significant role in their manipulation of linguistic form. Agency that exists extralinguistically, such as participation / non-participation in classroom-prescribed activities, also influences novice’s language learning outcomes. Finally, the findings prove that the LS process is contingent and bidirectional, and that novices, in this case learners of Japanese, actively organize and influence the LS process.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/conversation-cmc-tracing-novice-agency-language/docview/2492301804/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zaky, Hany",2020,Asynchronous Peer Assessment in ESL College Composition Curriculum: An Investigation of the Influence of Students' Learning Styles on Their Perceptions in USA Context,"Due to the growing focus on English learners' independence in composition classes, Peer Assessment has recently received the lion's share of attention. The use of Peer Assessment differs in various schools as different teaching styles of teachers and curriculum goals. This study investigated ESL college students' perceptions regarding these factors that could direct their use of Peer Assessment in their college writing classes. Comparisons of correlations between the different factors reported in the literature, such as gender, first language, first language writing, second language writing, and Peer Assessment preferences. Identifying these correlations could direct educators and curriculum designers to build their school's curricula around Peer Assessment as an instructional method to enhance 21st-century skills such as collaboration, cooperation, and negotiation. This quantitative study investigates ESL students' perceptions regarding the factors (gender/ first language/ first language writing learning styles/ Second language writing learning styles) directing their satisfaction of Asynchronous Peer Assessment use in terms of their learning styles in composition classes. This study is built on the research conducted by Huang (2015) entitled ""The influence of learning styles on Chinese students"" attitudes toward peer feedback: developing a survey tool for peer feedback training."" Statistical findings obtained from this research indicate that ESL students' learning styles of their writing in both first language and English as a second language might impact their perceptions of using Peer Assessment. Specifically, these statistical findings indicate that interpersonal learning styles of first language writing and the role of discussion before writing in English could direct students’ perceptions of using Peer Assessment. Furthermore, students' preferences for receiving Peer Assessment in different language areas such as quality of ideas, the flow of ideas, mechanics, grammar, and vocabulary could influence their perceptions of receiving and delivering a quality Peer Assessment. The significant contribution of this dissertation is addressing ESL students’ perceptions of the factors that could influence their perceptions of using Peer Assessment, as an instructional approach in writing classes in terms of their learning styles. It could provide writing teachers and curriculum designers and developers with some insightful perspectives to build on the writing theory and collaborative learning and teaching of writing. The dissertation contributions highlight how theory and practice should be.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/asynchronous-peer-assessment-esl-college/docview/2469531120/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Strawbridge, Arthur McReynolds",2020,The Social Networks: Characterizing L2 Spanish Proficiency Development in Study Abroad Through Social Network Analysis,"This study examines the social network development of L2 Spanish learners over the course of an academic semester spent studying abroad in Spain. Social network analysis has been utilized widely in sociological research to understand and predict a range of human behaviors, and has also been applied to research in sociolinguistics (Milroy, 1980) and second language acquisition (SLA) (e.g., Baker-Smemoe et al., 2014; Isabelli-García, 2006; Mitchell et al., 2017). The present investigation proposes to utilize this level of analysis to identify patterns in university sojourners’ social experience, to describe the relationship between these patterns and L2 Spanish proficiency development, and to contextualize these findings within the landscape of contemporary U.S. study abroad practice. Data for this investigation were collected from 43 L2 Spanish learners who were university students enrolled in various institutions in the U.S., and who spent the spring 2019 academic semester studying abroad in Spain. Students were recruited from six study abroad programs located in four cities in Spain (Granada, Madrid, Sevilla, Toledo). Social network data were collected via a specially designed social network questionnaire, while linguistic data were collected via the administration of two Spanish language proficiency tests, a Diploma de Español como Lengua Extranjera (DELE) exam and an elicited imitation task (EIT) (Ortega, Iwashita, Norris, &amp; Rabie, 1999). Data collection was performed at the beginning and end of the participants’ sojourn in Spain, a period of time lasting approximately 12 weeks. The results of this study identify four prominent social network patterns exhibited by students during their time abroad, characterized by varying levels of Spanish language use, emotional proximity to contacts, frequency of interaction, contact nationality, and network cohesion. These patterns exert a significant influence on learners’ gains in Spanish proficiency, with the most powerful influences on proficiency gains being the development of Spanish language-dominant social networks with NNS program peers, as well as the development of high numbers of integrated NS/NNS social groups. These findings are discussed in the context of the current state of U.S. study abroad programming.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/social-networks-characterizing-l2-spanish/docview/2444805016/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Holsworth, Michael J.",2020,"The Effect of Extensive Reading, Timed Reading, and Word Recognition Training on Reading","Word recognition skill is fundamental for readers to successfully process any given text. Proficiency in the component skills of word recognition, orthographic, phonological, and semantic knowledge, is what readers need to accurately and automatically decode words to apply meaning to what they have read. For second language readers, the challenge of reading is often hindered by a lack of word recognition skills and therefore, they often suffer from low reading rates and consequently poor reading comprehension. This study was a quasi-experimental longitudinal inquiry into the effects of extensive reading, word recognition training, and timed reading on second language reading comprehension. Through word recognition tasks focused on orthographic, phonological, and semantic knowledge development, the aim of this study was to (a) better understand the effects of orthographic, phonological, and semantic skill training on word recognition skills, (b) better understand the effects of word recognition training on reading rate and reading comprehension, (c) understand the effects of long-term word recognition training on reading comprehension, (d) investigate if changes in word recognition components correlate with changes in reading comprehension, and (e) better understand reasons for expected and unexpected outcomes of participants in the study. A total of 248 participants took part in the study. The participants were a combination of first- and second-year economics majors from a private university in western Japan. They were from ten intact classes that were randomly assigned to one of four groups. The first group acted as a comparison group and focused on intensive reading training. The second group did extensive reading and included sustained silent reading. The third group did extensive reading and received word recognition training. The fourth group did extensive reading, word recognition training and timed reading training. All participants took a reading course as part of the required English program that lasted for two 15-week academic terms. The first 30 minutes of each class were used for each group’s respective training, and the remaining 60 minutes were used to teach general reading strategies. Quantitative data were gathered using a variety of instruments that included a lexical decision test, an antonym pairs test, a pronunciation test, a reading comprehension test, and a reading rate test. Additional qualitative data were gathered via selected participant interviews and a post-study survey. The results showed that the participants who received word recognition training in conjunction with extensive reading, produced positive changes in reading comprehension. However, only two of the components of word recognition ability improved with training, semantic knowledge and phonological knowledge. This indicated that more focus on specific components of word recognition might provide better scaffolding to foster reading development. The results also indicated that the three treatment groups all performed significantly better than the comparison group in reading rate gain and those improvements were reflected in reading comprehension gains. With respect to word recognition and its impact on reading comprehension, there was evidence showing that word recognition training did positively impact reading comprehension, but that more time might be required than used in this study to see its full impact. Finally, there were data to indicate that there was a correlation between semantic knowledge and reading comprehension. This study shows that although extensive reading is an effective approach to teaching L2 English reading, the addition of word recognition training and timed reading can benefit readers by improving reading comprehension. The addition of word recognition training can assist lower-proficiency readers to automatize low-level cognitive processes such as orthographic, semantic, and phonological processes, and by doing so, reallocate cognitive resources to higher-level cognitive processes such as inferencing and schemata activation required for reading comprehension. Finally, the addition of timed reading seems to have contributed to overall reading rate and reading fluency development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-extensive-reading-timed-word-recognition/docview/2444407111/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Reaves, Alisha Jacqueline",2020,Discourse Markers in Second Language French,"In the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA), the acquisition of pragmatic competence has received far less attention that grammatical competence. Early focus on the acquisition of pragmatic competence has often centered on speech acts or conventional expressions. Discourse markers, also known as discourse particles, pragmatic particles and pragmatic markers, have received increasing attention over the last twenty years. These “little words”, are features of informal oral discourse and can contribute greatly to discourse cohesion and interlocutor interaction. Native speakers of French employ them extensively, and without them, discourse can seem stilted, unnatural or be difficult to follow. Despite their importance to communicative competence, they are largely ignored in the foreign language classroom and are generally presumed to be nearly un-acquirable without extensive immersion experience. And even with advanced language proficiency and extensive immersion experience, prior research has largely concluded that learners cannot or do not employ discourse markers like native speakers. This dissertation attempts to respond to this presumed limitation of foreign language (classroom) learners in examining the interlanguage of learners at three different proficiency levels. The 38 learners and 12 native speakers participated in an unstructured interview and completed three tasks: a narrative film retell, a film discussion and role-play scenarios, which were transcribed, coded and analyzed for their discourse marker use. The study identified discourse markers first by their function rather than from a predetermined list. The resulting inventory of discourse markers was then analyzed for frequency, variety and the range of functions expressed as learner proficiency increased. Results indicate that the frequency and variety of discourse markers produced does in general increase with proficiency. But interestingly, in concentrating on the functions expressed, we are able to observe shifts in discourse marker use for particular functions as the learner’s lexicon expands to include a wider range of discourse markers. Ultimately learners make extensive use of the discourse markers lexically available to them to perform a wide variety of functions. They then modify and expand these functions as more discourse markers are added to their lexicon.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/discourse-markers-second-language-french/docview/2444404090/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Bistline-Bonilla, Christine",2020,"Interaction in Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication: The Effects of Interlocutor, Task, and State Anxiety","There is an increasingly large body of research that has addressed how interaction via Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication (SCMC) may support second language (L2) development (see Ziegler, 2016 for a review). Various empirical studies in SCMC have demonstrated that type of interlocutor (e.g., Liu, 2017) and type of task (e.g., Blake, 2000; Yilmaz &amp; Granena, 2010) can significantly impact the amount of negotiation that occurs during interaction. Nevertheless, the number of empirical studies is limited and they vary widely in their methodology. In addition, other researchers have suggested that one of the possible advantages of SCMC over other modes of communication is its potential to reduce L2 learner anxiety (e.g., Abrams, 2003). 	The present study aims to contribute to instructed second language acquisition (ISLA) research by employing two types of tasks along with three types of interlocutors in SCMC to address whether 1) production of language-related episodes (LREs) on task, 2) amount of talk on task, and 3) L2 lexical recognition and production scores over time are related to type of interlocutor, type of task, and learners’ state anxiety. It included 82 adult intermediate L2 learners of Spanish who collaborated with either a peer, professor, or native speaker via Zoom instant messaging to complete 1) an information gap task and 2) a decision-making task. After completing each experimental task, they completed a state anxiety questionnaire adapted from Baralt and Gurzynski-Weiss (2011). 	Statistical analyses revealed that a combination of Type of interlocutor and Type of task differentially affected the production of LREs and the amount of talk on task. In terms of participants’ lexical recognition and production performance over time, the analyses indicated that while Type of interlocutor played a limited role, participants were significantly more accurate in their recognition and written production of the decision-making task target items. It was also found that interlocutor type and task type were not predictors of participants’ overall state anxiety. Ultimately, these findings provide a better understanding of the roles of interlocutor status and the type of task in text-based SCMC and their impact on subsequent recognition and written production of L2 lexical forms.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interaction-synchronous-computer-mediated/docview/2443656789/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lee, Keunyoung",2020,"Impoliteness, Identity and Power in Korean: Critical Discourse Analysis and Perception Study of Impoliteness","The current dissertation aims to further our understanding of the impoliteness phenomenon in language by investigating how impoliteness is connected to the construction of identity and the exercise of power in on-going interaction. To achieve the research goal, the study closely examines naturally occurring polylogal discourse from two different institutional settings in the context of Korean: the TV talk show (television entertainment discourse) and the National Assembly’s hearing (political discourse). Following the notion of relational work proposed by Locher and Watts (2005) and the bottom-up approach (i.e. impoliteness 1 or first order impoliteness) which focuses on participants’ judgements of discourse in interaction, the study argues that impoliteness is inextricably linked to participants’ co-constructions of identity as an interactional resource causing conflicts and as a linguistic index showing where co-participants identities are negotiated. The study also argues that impoliteness plays a significant role in the exercise of power in political discourse by illustrating that the successful use of impoliteness causing offense is strategically used to restrict the action environment of one’s interlocutor. The findings of the study suggests that the judgements of impoliteness are related to the institutional norms and expectations but also highly context-dependent.&#xa0; The study also expands the discussion of impoliteness to L2 learners’ perception of impoliteness in the target language by examining how L2 proficiency and cross-cultural variations affect learner’s perception of impoliteness. It is observed that there is L2 proficiency effect when the context has limited visual and prosodic features that learners can rely on for their judgements. The study identifies that Korean honorifics is one of the major causes which lead the novice learners to misjudge impolite utterances as polite because they could not understand the sarcastic use of honorifics which appear as polite on surface but convey offensive and insincere messages. The results of the study suggest that interpreting humor, jokes and sarcasm/irony is a quite difficult pragmatic task for the novice L2 learners.&#xa0;", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/impoliteness-identity-power-korean-critical/docview/2442595771/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

This study explores the implementation of semantic language play tasks in an intact Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) classroom. In the study, I detail how I designed and implemented tasks meant to foster play in a JFL class. I analyze qualitative data from transcripts of classroom learner interactions to show how study participants played, experimented, and pushed themselves in their L2 during interactive tasks designed for playful language use. I also explore how participants provided peer assistance during playful interactions. The study shows how playful language learning tasks can encourage creativity, participation, and expression within the language classroom.

"Suzumura, Nana",2020,The Usefulness of the Computer-Based Speaking Tasks of the AP Japanese Exam,"The Advanced Placement (AP) Japanese Language and Culture exam (the AP Japanese exam) is a large-scale high-stakes test targeting high school students in the United States. It is a computer-based test that consists of speaking, listening, reading, and writing sections. The present study focuses on the speaking section which aims to measure examinees’ interpersonal communication skills and presentational skills. The usefulness of the speaking tasks was investigated from a variety of perspectives. Drawing upon Bachman and Palmer’s (1996) model of test usefulness, the present study scrutinized reliability, construct validity, and authenticity of the AP Japanese speaking test tasks. In order to strengthen arguments regarding the usefulness of the AP Japanese speaking test tasks, the present study employed a mixed methods research design. The primary design was a concurrent design (R. B. Johnson &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Teddlie &amp; Tashakkori, 2006, 2009). The present study also employed a partial sequential design to integrate quantitative and qualitative methods at the analysis stage. Evidence for the usefulness of the test was collected by examining the speaking tasks used for the AP Japanese exam in the past, examinees’ language samples and test scores from the simulation of the AP Japanese exam, and examinee and rater survey responses. Four sets of conversation tasks and two sets of cultural perspective presentation tasks were selected from past test items and used in the simulation test. A total of 111 high school students, from two U.S. states, who were planning to take the AP Japanese exam participated in the present study. Their performance was rated by a total of six raters who participated in the present study: three raters for the conversation task and three raters for the presentation task. From the quantitative strand, generalizability theory and many-facet Rasch measurement (MFRM) (Linacre, 1989) were employed to analyze the test scores and to collect evidence primarily for reliability and construct validity. From the qualitative strand, discourse analysis was employed to analyze test task characteristics and examinees’ performance and to collect evidence primarily for authenticity and construct validity. The present study found that overall the AP Japanese speaking section has a reasonable level of usefulness in that it showed a reasonable level of reliability and it aims to represent more dimensions of speaking ability than other computer-based language tests. Yet it also has some issues related to construct validity and authenticity, especially for the conversation task. In particular, the present study recommends reviewing the amount of contextual information, the proportion of information-seeking prompts and non-information-seeking prompts, and the appropriateness of the conversation scoring criteria in relation to the nature of the conversation prompts. The present study illustrated how intricately different facets of test usefulness can interact. This study exemplified how useful a mixed methods approach can be in collecting more comprehensive evidence for test validation and how that in turn can allow for more meaningful and practical suggestions to improve the overall usefulness of a language test.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/usefulness-computer-based-speaking-tasks-ap/docview/2430176301/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hauk, Bryn",2020,Deixis and Reference Tracking in Tsova-Tush,"This dissertation takes an in-depth look at deixis and reference tracking in Tsova-Tush, a Northeast Caucasian language spoken in the Republic of Georgia. First, I establish basic patterns of argument structure, complementation, and question formation using available corpora. I identify an unusual type of subordination that combines properties of complement and relative clauses, and I outline patterns of apparent long-distance agreement and long-distance reflexivization. Together, these descriptions characterize the structure of simple clauses through complex sentences in Tsova-Tush. Building off these insights, I undertake an investigation of deixis in embedded contexts, typically established within complement clauses. I show that Tsova-Tush has a restricted type of indexical shift, in which all context parameters shift together under verbs of speech, while indexically shifted clauses retain the ability to form semantic dependencies. Beyond indexical shift, I detail other types of embedded perspectives, including quotation and perspective-taking under perception verbs, and I use corpus methods to describe the function of quotatives and discourse markers. Finally, I explore reference tracking in thirteen narratives. I identify an indefinite marker for first mentions of animate referents and discuss the use of demonstrative adjectives as markers of definiteness at subsequent mentions. Conditions for covert reference, including activation status and syntactic position, are described. Argument dropping is found to be preferred when reference is continuous across clauses and when the referent serves as the subject of a transitive verb. Further, in contrast to some other languages, I show that gender in Tsova-Tush is a poor strategy for reference tracking, but that shifted attitudes assist in maintaining the activation and prominence of the attitude holder. This examination of narratives further contributes a description of several additional discourse-level features, including tail-head linkage. Altogether, this dissertation provides a detailed examination of patterns in Tsova-Tush syntax, semantics, and discourse relevant to the study of deixis and reference tracking. I show that Tsova-Tush exhibits syntactic phenomena found in other Caucasian languages, such as indexical shift and long-distance agreement. Further, I find that one purpose of shifted indexicals is to aid in reference tracking, while gender agreement can fail to exhibit this function.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/deixis-reference-tracking-tsova-tush/docview/2428561000/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hwang, Haerim",2020,"A Contrast Between Vp-Ellipsis and Gapping in English: L1 Acquisition, L2 Acquisition, and L2 Processing","This dissertation probes the L1 acquisition, L2 acquisition, and L2 processing of contrasts between two seemingly similar phenomena in English. The first, VP-Ellipsis (VPE), involves the deletion of an entire verb phrase (e.g., Sara made pizza and Kelly did [e] too ); the second, Gapping, involves a verb gap (e.g., Sara made pizza and Kelly [e] pasta). One such contrast is that whereas VPE is grammatical both in conjunct clauses and in adjunct clauses (e.g., Sara made pizza {and Kelly did too/because Kelly did} ), Gapping is grammatical only in conjunct clauses (e.g., Sara made pizza {and Kelly pasta/*because Kelly pasta }). Another contrast is that whereas Gapping (e.g., Mom hugged the boy at home and Dad in the park ) allows the noun phrase following the conjunction to be interpreted as either the subject (e.g., ‘hugger’) or object (e.g., ‘huggee’) of the gapped verb, VPE (e.g., Mom hugged the boy at home and Dad did too ) permits only a subject reading. Importantly, these grammaticality and interpretation contrasts constitute learnability challenges for L1-English children and L1-Korean L2ers of English alike: For neither group can input alone lead to implicit knowledge of the impossibility of both Gapping in adjunct clauses and the object reading for VPE; for L1-Korean L2ers, moreover, implicit knowledge that VPE in adjunct clauses is possible and that the object reading for VPE is impossible cannot come from their L1 grammar or from their classroom instruction, either. Study 1 is a corpus-based study examining how (in)frequent VPE and Gapping are in the input to L1-English children and the input to L1-Korean L2ers of English. The input corpora to each of these groups revealed hardly any instances of VPE in adjunct clauses or of Gapping at all, which suggests that input alone cannot derive the two contrasts at issue. Two acquisition studies tested L1-English children ( n = 24–33) and (early, n = 27; late, n = 30) L1-Korean L2ers of English for knowledge of these contrasts between VPE and Gapping: the grammaticality contrast via an acceptability judgment task (Study 2) and the interpretation contrast via a picture-sentence matching task (Study 3). The results showed that (a) the L1 children know the grammaticality contrast as early as age 5;11 and the interpretation contrast as early as age 5;6, and (b) the higher-proficiency early L2ers and most of the late L2ers had also acquired both contrasts. Processing of Gapping vs. VPE by adult L1-Korean L2ers ( n = 48) was investigated in Study 4 via a self-paced reading task making use of the fact that (im)plausibility is manipulable in Gapping, but not in VPE, by changing the verb (e.g., Bill {ordered/*drank} coffee and Jane sandwiches vs. Bill {ordered/drank} coffee and Jane did too ). Like the native speaker controls ( n = 53), the adult L2ers exhibited implausibility effects only for Gapping, thereby indicating that they can retrieve verb information at the gap site in real-time processing. In short, the acquisition studies provide evidence that L1 children and L1-Korean L2ers can overcome the learnability problems involved in the grammaticality and interpretation contrasts between VPE and Gapping in English, and the self-paced reading study demonstrates that adult L1-Korean L2ers can process English Gapping sentences in a target-like manner.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/contrast-between-vp-ellipsis-gapping-english-l1/docview/2428556967/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Rothgerber, John Robert",2020,The Influence of Native Language Phonotactics on Second Language Lexical Representation in Japanese Learners of English,"Previous studies on segmental contrasts have suggested that learners may store the sounds of second language (L2) words in their mental lexicons in a way that is influenced by the first language (L1) phonological system. However, it remains unclear what influence L1 phonotactic constraints have on L2 lexical representations. Phonotactic constraints are language-specific constraints on how sounds can be arranged and sequenced. In Japanese, for example, two consonants cannot occur together in the syllable onset. Therefore, the English word group is adapted into Japanese as [ɡuɾuːpu], with an epenthetic vowel inserted into the consonant cluster. Research has shown that L1 Japanese learners tend to perceive an epenthetic vowel [u] in English consonant clusters, despite no vowel being present. It is therefore possible that they also encode this epenthetic vowel in the mental lexicon. The current study addressed this possibility by using a lexical decision task with Japanese learners of English. Nonword stimuli were created by inserting epenthetic vowels into real English words (e.g., [ɡuɹuːp] from group [ɡɹuːp]). Words were varied according to their loanword status in Japanese and to the cluster-initial consonant. The results showed that learners tended to accept such nonwords as real words, and intermediate learners showed higher rates of acceptance than advanced learners. No effects were found for loanword status or consonant type. The results of the lexical decision task correlated strongly with the results of an oddity discrimination task, which is a measure of perception. These findings provide evidence that learners lexically encode epenthetic vowels. This, in turn, suggests that L1 phonotactic constraints influence L2 lexical representations. As learners advance in proficiency, they tend to become more accurate in both perception and lexical representation, although further research is needed to tease apart the relationship between the two.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/influence-native-language-phonotactics-on-second/docview/2425859886/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Vallejos, Cristi",2020,"Fluency, Working Memory, and Second Language Proficiency in Multicompetent Writers","The present study compared pausing behavior while writing in the L1 and the L2 of emergent bilinguals and investigated the role of WM and proficiency level, as well as observed the cognitive processes that occurred during these pauses using a mixed-methods approach. Learners from a 5th semester ( N = 17), 7 th semester ( N = 16), and graduating seniors ( N = 14) produced argumentative tasks in their L1 and L2 and all writing behavior was recorded using Inputlog (Leijten &amp; Van Waes, 2013), a keystroke logging program designed specifically for writing studies. Pause frequency and length was compared within and across languages and regressions were run to test the effects of the different components of WM on pausing behavior in the L1 and L2. Proficiency level was also included for the L2. Stimulated recalls were collected for a subset of participants ( N = 5) and these were coded according to Kellogg’s (1996) model of writing to compare cognitive behavior. Results show that in both languages pause length increased by constituent level but that all pauses were longer in Spanish than English. The relationship of WM and pauses was different for each language, in English visual spatial WM was related to pause frequency between sentences while the updating function was related to pause length between words and pause length and frequency between sentences in Spanish. Proficiency level was found to have the most effects on pauses, with those at higher proficiency levels pausing less frequently between words and sentences and pausing for shorter periods of time. Stimulated recall comments showed that participants did engage in the cognitive processes described by Kellogg (1996) in both languages, however there were qualitative differences. Processes related to formulation were the most prevalent in both languages, but there were more behaviors related to planning in English and translation was the most frequent behavior in Spanish. Some differences were also seen by proficiency level, those with a lower proficiency level did not show evidence of monitoring in Spanish while those with a higher proficiency level did.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/fluency-working-memory-second-language/docview/2414708854/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Schaefer, Vance",2015,Influence of the first and second language on the perception of Thai tones,"Convergent results from second language (L2) phonology literature suggest that when a phonetic or linguistic dimension is present or important in the first language (L1) of a learner, acquiring words that use this dimension in an L2 will be facilitated (Feature Hypothesis, McAllister, Flege &amp; Piske, 2002). This study applies this hypothesis to the dimension of linguistic pitch by testing speakers from L1s which utilize lexically-contrastive pitch in varying manners and degrees—Mandarin Chinese, (using pitch as tone), Japanese (using pitch accent), English (using pitch in word stress), and finally Korean (not using pitch to distinguish words)—on their perception of Thai tones. Additionally, an L1-English-speaking group who learned Mandarin as an L2 was tested on their perception of Thai tones to examine whether they can transfer their acquired perception of Mandarin tones to the naive perception of Thai tones. This L2 Mandarin Learner group has also been tested on a lexical decision task composed of Mandarin words and non-words to determine their acquisition of L2 Mandarin tone. Results show that lexically-contrastive pitch in the L1 does indeed influence the perception of a non-native lexically-contrastive pitch system, namely Thai tones. Furthermore, this influence differs in a hierarchical manner depending on the extent of the usage of lexically-contrastive pitch system. Second, results clearly demonstrate learning a tone language as an L2, i.e., Mandarin Chinese, by L1 speakers of English shapes the perception of a non-native tone language, i.e., Thai. Exposure to and accordingly encoding of Mandarin tones appear to be sufficiently robust to shape the naïve perception of Thai tones. L2 Mandarin learners outperform non-learners of Mandarin who also speak English as an L1 and perform at comparable levels to L1 speakers of Mandarin on the naïve perception of Thai tones. Furthermore, results show that learners are generally able to encode L2 tonal information in their lexical representations to the extent that lexical access is constrained.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/influence-first-second-language-on-perception/docview/1746683619/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Xie, Feng",2020,Exploring CFL Learners’ Message Formation Process Through Video-recorded Text Chat,"This study explores the affordances of text-based synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) for advanced-level Chinese learning. Research on SCMC has shown its benefits for second language acquisition. It has been proved to bring opportunities for second/foreign language learners to negotiate for meaning, receive comprehensible input, obtain corrective feedback from their interlocutors, self-correct their own errors, and notice “gaps” in their interlanguage systems. However, there has been little scholarship that tracks learners’ moment-to-moment behaviors as they engage in SCMC activities. Using video screen capture technology, this study examined advanced-level CFL learners’ message formation process when engaging in text chat (one type of SCMC) discussions with different types of partners (i.e., with other CFL learners, or with Chinese native speakers). Learners’ perceptions of participating in text chat activities were collected from post-activity questionnaire and interviews. The first research question focused on the issues of the learners’ interlanguage systems and the errors committed by them. The findings show that learners from both the NNS (non-native speaker) and HS (heritage speaker) groups committed more errors on grammatical and lexical items than Chinese characters and phonological items. The second research question centered on the extent to which learners noticed and corrected their errors. The findings show that they self-corrected most phonological and Chinese character errors, but only a small portion of lexical and grammatical errors. Comparisons between different groups of learners’ language production show that the heritage learners had a better performance than the second language learners (i.e., non-heritage learners). However, language productions from both groups were found to be influenced by their native languages (mainly English) or native Chinese dialects (other than Mandarin). Findings from learners’ perceptions showed that their attitudes toward text chat activities were positive. They liked that text chat discussions offered them opportunities to use their Chinese language in a less threatening communicative setting, to solidify previously learned knowledge, and to look up new words to convey their meanings. They also particularly enjoyed chatting with Chinese native speakers. Although occasionally being “annoyed” by the lengthy character searching processes, they generally still enjoyed practice typing in Chinese. They also offered specific suggestions on integrating text chat activities into the curriculum design of Chinese language classes.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-cfl-learners-message-formation-process/docview/2403116141/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Cerda Oñate, Karina",2019,Testing the Effect of Synchronous Speech Tasks in the Production of L2 Speech Rhythm in Learners of Spanish as a Second Language,"The following study tested the effect of synchronous and non-synchronous speech conditions in the production of L2 speech rhythm in Spanish. Namely, it assessed the production of American English speakers of Spanish with intermediate and upper-intermediate levels of competence in Spanish (n = 31) in comparison to the L1 speech rhythm of a control group of native speakers of Spanish (n = 32). For this purpose, speech samples were elicited from a reading aloud task, including four speech conditions: 1) Synchrony live condition; 2) Synchrony with the recording from the live condition; 3) Synchrony with a recording from a non-live condition; and, 4) Solo recording condition. The analysis of the results showed that the speech rhythm of the experimental group and the control group was modulated by the different conditions of the experimental task. Notably, non-native participants produced longer vocalic and consonantal intervals and higher vowel percentages than the native speakers of Chilean Spanish across conditions. The theoretical and pedagogical implications concerning the use of synchronous speech in the production of L2 speech rhythm are assessed and discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/testing-effect-synchronous-speech-tasks/docview/2452124238/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Imai, Junko",2019,L2 Learning-to-Write through Writing Conferences: A Mixed Methods Research Study,"A writing conference (WrC) is a one-on-one consulting session concerning a student’s written academic work that takes place in a novice–expert pair. The literature on second language (L2) WrCs commonly addresses issues such as how novice writers learn to write, writers’ communicative responsibilities, and the challenges involved in L2 WrCs (e.g., Cumming &amp; So, 1996; Ewert, 2009; Patthey-Chavez &amp; Ferris, 1997; Young &amp; Miller, 2004). L2 writing research has identified conditions that lead to successful textual revisions by coding texts, while conference studies have illustrated dominance and miscommunication in WrC talk by analyzing discursive practices. Yet these approaches are rarely employed together to understand data from the same participants and contexts, and most studies have been conducted on a small scale. To understand the effectiveness, meaningfulness, and challenges of L2 WrCs, I introduced WrCs in a college-level English for Academic Purpose (EAP) program in Hawai‘i. Employing a sequential explanatory mixed-methods research design (Creswell, 2009), I collected pre and post questionnaires and essays from 108 learners. Over the course of the semester, 33 student–tutor pairs met for WrCs outside of regular EAP class times. I video recorded the WrCs, collected the students’ drafts and revisions, and conducted playback interviews with each participant. I statistically compared the quality of the students’ texts and attitudes, coded the topics discussed, discourse structures, and revision types, and explored the participants’ performances qualitatively. While the findings of the quantitative analysis indicate marginal effectiveness of L2 WrCs, the coding analysis demonstrates the diversity of the participants’ engagement in the WrCs. Qualitative analysis of selected WrCs illustrates the active participation and scaffolding that occurred in individual sessions, shows the interactive structure of the WrCs, and validates quantitative and coding results. Finally, the study explores the convergence and divergence of the findings from the different analyses, allowing a mixed-methods interpretation that casts new light on WrCs and L2 learning-to-write. Pedagogically, this study addresses the following matters: (a) whether WrCs are useful, (b) whether L2 learners should attend WrCs, (c) what learners and their tutors discuss during WrCs, and (d) how learners and tutors participate in WrCs.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-learning-write-through-writing-conferences/docview/2379033484/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tobaru, Hiromi",2019,Style Shifting and Social Network Development during Education Abroad Programs in Japan,"This dissertation explores ways that home institutions—educational institutions that send their students to affiliated universities—can provide pedagogical support to maximize the learning experience of U.S. undergraduate students during yearlong education abroad (EdA) programs in Japan. The results of this dissertation suggest several features that are key to pre-EdA training. The most crucial is repeated experiential practice on inter-personal negotiations toward co-constructing a meaningful Third Space (Jian &amp; Walker, 2017) that entails raising sensitivity to style-shifting strategies. Group, rather than individualized, format better maximizes the opportunities for negotiation. Also useful would be opportunities to hear the experience of students who have just returned from a yearlong EdA in Japan, focusing on their experience (or lack) of network building. The need for repeated practice entails that training occurs over a duration of time, such as a semester. The first phase of this research examined difficulties in building intercultural relationships that American students and local Japanese students experience in a short-term EdA program in Japan. Data collected through interviews and observation suggest that the two groups have gaps in their expectations about speech style when interacting with each other. In particular, U.S. students struggled in shifting their speech from formal to casual. Based on these findings a pre-departure training regimen was devised for students participating in a yearlong EdA program in Japan. The training focused on style-shifting skills to develop a relationship-building persona in a Japanese college setting. The second phase of the study investigated the outcomes and process of learning in yearlong EdA exchange programs. Of the seven undergraduate students who participated in this phase of the study, four went through the pre-EdA training, while the other three chose not to. Two proficiency tests and a microanalysis of their discourse in terms of style shifting during proficiency interviews were used to assess the outcomes of all participants’ EdA gain. The process of their EdA learning was examined by analyzing their language use logs and interviews about social network development. The effectiveness of the EdA training was measured by comparing the findings of the two groups, i.e. the EdA training group and the non-EdA training group. Findings suggested that the EdA training did not have a great impact on the participants’ outcome of EdA learning as measured by the proficiency tests. However, a closer examination of the learning process revealed that those participants who faced and endeavored to overcome challenges in building their social networks with locals demonstrated more EdA gain than those who did not. These students had to negotiate relationships continuously with interlocutors from the host community. Repeated negotiation experiences may have facilitated these EdA students’ learning of how to communicate effectively in Third Spaces. In the current study, such social ties are called negotiated Third Space . The findings also suggested that the structure of EdA programs at host universities (e.g., roles and culture of dorms, school events, language programs, etc.) had the greatest impact on constructing negotiated Third Spaces. In order to maximize EdA learning in Japan, it is crucial to support EdA students’ negotiation skills. EdA students can utilize style shifting as a communication strategy to recognize, negotiate, and co-construct expectations with locals. Such skills also help EdA students develop a relationship-building persona, which enables them to forge intercultural relationships with locals, which in turn maximizes their EdA learning in Japan. In addition, understanding each EdA program from the students’ perspectives is also crucial to maximize EdA learning in general. Home institutions should use the returnees as a resource for those who will participate in the same EdA program.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/style-shifting-social-network-development-during/docview/2320962890/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Chen, Yunchuan",2019,The Acquisition of Japanese Relative Clauses by L1 Chinese Learners,"This dissertation focuses on L1 Chinese learners’ acquisition of Japanese relative clauses (RCs), as it provides an ideal testing ground for two important questions of L2 acquisition in syntax: (i) when two languages have a superficially similar syntactic structure that arguably involves different syntactic operations, can L2 learners acquire the difference? (ii) if successful acquisition of such a difference does occur, in what ways does that inform us about the nature of L2 acquisition of syntax? Despite such superficial similarities between Chinese and Japanese RCs, previous theoretical work puts forward different analyses for their syntactic structures. Thus, the first two parts of this dissertation provide novel experimental evidence indicating that the head noun phrase (NP) of RCs is only base-generated in Japanese but is either raised or base-generated in Chinese. Nevetheless, the experimental evidence also suggests that the raising strategy is preferred to the base-generation strategy to derive the head NP from the singly embedded object position of Chinese RCs. In the third part, I reported the findings from another experiment I created to explore whether L1 Chinese learners of L2 Japanese are able to acquire the syntactic knowledge that the head NP of Japanese RCs can only be base-generated. Since such knowledge is implicit, I used a diagnostic to test how L1 Chinese learners interpret the anaphor jibun ‘self’ within the head NP of Japanese RCs. The experimental results show that at least some advanced L1 Chinese learners of Japanese have acquired the difference between Chinese and Japanese RCs in terms of the interpretation of the anaphor inside the head NP, despite its underdetermined nature. This in turn argues for the Full Transfer/Full Access Hypothesis (Schwartz &amp; Sprouse, 1994, 1996) and argues against ‘partial access to UG’ approaches such as the Interpretability Hypothesis (Tsimpli &amp; Dimitrakopoulou, 2007).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-japanese-relative-clauses-l1-chinese/docview/2316439620/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Evans, Anna A.",2019,"An Integrated Writing Task in French as a Foreign Language: An Analysis of Processes, Products, and Perceptions","Writing instruction and assessment in foreign language courses have traditionally relied on independent writing tasks, which require learners to compose essays in response to short prompts. Concerns with the limitations of independent writing tasks (e.g., inauthenticity) have resulted in increased interest in integrated/source-based writing tasks. Integrated writing tasks require learners to use sources in their writing and thus resemble academic writing more closely than do independent writing tasks. A review of the research literature has revealed a significant lack of studies investigating both composing processes and written products in response to integrated writing tasks, French as a second language writing, source-based writing on a computer, and the use of modalities other than print sources (e.g., visual and audio sources). This study addresses the identified research gaps by investigating French learners’ composing processes, written products, and perceptions in response to an integrated writing task in which the participants read a passage, visually examine a graph, listen to an audio recording, and then write a persuasive essay based on the three sources. Participants were 38 university students enrolled in third-year French language courses. Data included think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, notes, essays, questionnaire responses, and interviews. Data analysis focused on (a) composing processes and time allocated to them; (b) total amount, location, attribution, and degree of transformation of language integrated from the sources into the essays; and (c) perceptions of the integrated writing task and source use. Results indicate that the French learners actively interacted with the sources and integrated them into their writing in a variety of ways. Despite a relatively high percentage of the total amount of textual borrowing in the essays, the participants’ tendency to acknowledge and transform language from the sources pointed to their developing abilities and skills in appropriate source use. Most students liked writing an essay in response to the integrated writing task and viewed the three sources as valuable resources for language, content, and organization. Finally, pedagogical implications for student writing in upper-level foreign language courses are discussed. By incorporating integrated writing tasks along with traditional independent writing tasks, instructors can diversify their practices in writing instruction and assessment, increase the authenticity of writing tasks, and prepare students for their future foreign language courses, academic studies, and professional pursuits.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/integrated-writing-task-french-as-foreign/docview/2311898745/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Olovson, Brian M.",2018,Are Two Heads Better than One? A Process and Product Analysis of Collaborative Writing in the Spanish as a Foreign Language Classroom,"Collaborative work in pairs or groups is a common practice in the workplace, in content courses, and in classrooms across languages, settings, and geopolitical boundaries. However, research on collaborative writing—working with a partner to jointly produce a text, including both planning and writing phases—is limited. In addition, it has resulted in contradictory findings, especially in terms of whether learners deliberate about language and how the composition process affects the written texts produced learners produce. The present study, carried out in a fifth-semester university Spanish Writing course, examines the process (i.e., interaction) and product (i.e., written document) of a collaborative writing module that focused on the creation of narratives. The analysis of learners’ collaborative dialogue produced during the planning and writing phases of the interaction focuses on: (1) at a macro level, how learners apportion their time while collaboratively planning and producing a written narrative (e.g., planning, formulating, revising); and (2) at a micro level, the types (e.g., discourse, grammatical, lexical, mechanical), frequency, and resolution (e.g., resolved, unresolved, resolved incorrectly) of their language-related episodes (i.e., the instances where they talk about the language they are producing and question their language use). Learners’ jointly produced texts were examined analytically in terms of complexity, fluency, and accuracy measures, as well as holistically using a rubric. Additionally, a microdiscourse analytic approach was used to examine the means by which members of a collaborative pair position themselves as partners in a collaborative writing activity. Results indicate that a fully collaborative writing event is a productive site for co- constructed learning as students pool their knowledge to solve language-use problems, particularly those related to word choice and grammatical structures. Additionally, the texts composed collaboratively are of higher quality, based on several of the measures utilized, than texts composed individually by members of the collaborative pair. Finally, implications for implementing collaborative writing tasks in L2 classrooms are discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/are-two-heads-better-than-one-process-product/docview/2078878558/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Yelin, Boris",2018,Lexical Access and Cross-linguistic Influence in Trilingual Language Switching,"Recent psycholinguistic research has explored language switching in bilingual populations to understand how language is stored in the mind. Whereas the bilingual analysis has been useful, multilingual switching may provide more nuanced details about how the multilingual lexicon (vocabulary) is cognitively organized and how languages interact during speech. This dissertation examines the structure of the multilingual lexicon in two ways: (1) reaction time and carrier phrase duration measures are examined to provide evidence of trilingual lexical access when language switching in connected speech; (2) cross-linguistic influence in trilingual production is examined as evidence of the organization of the lexicon. The independent variable is language dominance. This dissertation is the first known study in which the L1, L2, and L3 are purposely varied for participants, which allows for generalizable results regardless of a specific language combination. It is also the first study to use a task that combines sentence reading in conjunction with cued picture naming, where the picture represented the object of the sentence to be produced. There were eleven sets of language triads (e.g. English, Russian, Spanish or English, French, Portuguese); within a triad, eight easily identified words with comparable mean frequencies in each language were chosen as object stimuli. Each stimulus contained a written carrier phrase in one of the participant’s three languages. The carrier phrase language was randomly selected, and it was followed by an object represented by a picture, which was to be named in the target language of the session (L1, L2, or L3). Stimuli were presented in conditions; a condition was a set of trials in which the target language of the language switch was always the same. Conditions were counterbalanced, with respect to order of acquisition, so that an equal number ( n = 7) of the total participants ( N = 42) followed each of the six potential orderings, e.g. L2, L3, L1 or L1, L3, L2, which was repeated for the total of nine conditions. In each condition, thirty-six stimuli were presented. All forty-two participants also completed a language profile questionnaire in order to gauge language dominance. Results from three mixed models (two for each of the reaction time analyses and one for the carrier phrase duration analysis), examining the main effects, support prior studies of lexical access investigating switch costs in which switching into a more dominant language exhibits a slower reaction time. Additionally, the results provide complementary approaches where latencies may be attributed to the predictability of a language switch. The cross-linguistic influence results partially corroborate past research in which more dominant languages were more easily suppressed, but do not strongly support the claim that more dominant languages cause less cross-linguistic influence. Rather data show that the L2 is both the most influential and most affected language, which supports the L2 Status Factor Model which states that the L2 has an intermediary position between one’s native language and other languages. Considered together, a more nuanced picture of the multilingual lexicon appears in which forces of inhibition and activation exist in an interplay to moderate lexical selection.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/lexical-access-cross-linguistic-influence/docview/2054017459/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Göktürk, Nazlınur",2016,“Every Student Didn’t Learn English” the Acquisition of Scope by L2 Learners of English,"This thesis examines how Turkish learners of English interpret constructions involving negation and a universal quantifier phrase such as every squirrel didn’t pick up nuts . Two experiments were conducted in this study. The first experiment, which consisted of an off-line acceptability rating task, was devised to set the baseline for Turkish and English native speakers’ scope interpretations of the target constructions, and to test how L2 learners with different proficiency levels (i.e., intermediate and advanced) interpret the target constructions. It was administered to the English, and Turkish native speakers, intermediate and advanced L2 learners. The second experiment, which involved a self-paced reading task in tandem with an end-of-trial truth-value judgment task, aimed to find out how Turkish L2 learners of English comprehend the target statements in real-time. It was administered to the native speakers of English, intermediate and advanced L2 learners. The results of the off-line study showed that there was not a developmental pattern in L2 learners’ scope judgments, contrary to the assumptions of the Full Transfer/Full Access Hypothesis. The advanced L2 learners were found to behave like Turkish native speakers in their scope judgments, while the intermediate L2 learners seemed to exhibit native-like behavior in their scope judgments. However, the results from the on-line study revealed that intermediate L2 learners processed the target constructions in a non-native-like manner, whereas the advanced L2 learners manifested native-like processing behavior in the interpretation of the target constructions. The observed differences in the L2 learner group are accounted by integrating the Developmentally Moderated Transfer Hypothesis and a pragmatic account of Turkish quantifier scope.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/every-student-didn-t-learn-english-acquisition/docview/3132861365/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Wang, Hao",2016,Towards Perceptually Enhanced Corrective Feedback Generation in Computer-Aided Pronunciation Training with Crowdsourcing and Spectral Space Warping Strategies,"This thesis investigates different methodologies for feedback generation in existing computer-aided pronunciation training (CAPT) systems and proposes perceptually enhancing corrective feedback generation (in the context of CAPT systems targeting Chinese learners of English) from two aspects: (1) prioritizing detected mispronunciations based on listeners’ perception; and (2) synthesizing personalized correct pronunciations to facilitate learners’ perception. It is of pedagogical importance that only a few (instead of all) errors made by the learner should be signaled at one time. Speech intelligibility to listeners is a reasonable criterion to prioritize errors. The first contribution of this thesis starts with collecting perceptual ratings of word-level non-native English mispronunciations according to different levels of severity using the novel crowdsourcing technique. Then, the WorkerRank algorithm is devised to control the quality of the crowdsourced data from anonymous Workers. As a result, a subset of the Workers is selected as reliable and their ratings are deemed reliable . The second contribution focuses on the use of reliable crowdsourced data and phonological modeling to predict human perceptual gradations on non-native English word mispronunciations. Word mispronunciation gradation is highly dependent on phonetic errors which are represented by phonological rule s. Hence, each phonological rule can be assigned with a gradation score which is, in turn, used to predict gradations of word mispronunciations. Experimental results show that this prediction mechanism is able to closely approximate human listeners’ perception in terms of the level of agreement on ratings of mispronunciations. Once errors are pinpointed, it can be perceptually very useful for a learner to listen to the corresponding correct pronunciations in his/her own voice. The third contribution focuses on achieving this goal by implementing a novel spectral space warping approach to cross-lingual voice transformation for HMM-based speech synthesis. This approach uses only a target speaker’s Mandarin corpus and a reference speaker’s English corpus. Based on an assumption that the spectral space of a speaker is composed of universal elementary units (e.g. tied states) in different languages, the proposed approach warps one spectral space towards the other by finding an optimal one-to-one tied state mapping, thus bridging across both language and speaker differences between the two corpora. Consequently, the target speaker’s high-quality English speech can be synthesized.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/towards-perceptually-enhanced-corrective-feedback/docview/1957904418/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nomura, Kazuyuki",2016,A Sociocultural Analysis of Motivation for Learning the Japanese Language in Contemporary Hong Kong,"Japanese is a major foreign language in Hong Kong with an estimated 90,000 Japanese-speaking Hong Kong Chinese today. This thesis examines how sociocultural contexts feed into various motivations behind Japanese language learning in contemporary Hong Kong. By observing interactions at eight classrooms in four educational institutions and analyzing life history narratives from 29 proficient speakers of Japanese, I look into how Hong Kong Chinese learners of the Japanese language craft their social identities through their language socialization. Language socialization is defined as motivational processes in which a novice learner seeks competence in the target language, and simultaneously desires to become associated with the target culture. My findings are two-fold. First, while the “Chinese learner” is often characterized as a passive or non-autonomous learner, the Hong Kong Chinese learners of Japanese language I studied are active learners who self-select what they want to gain or not to gain from language learning. Second, Hong Kong Chinese learners of Japanese language are generally motivated to become socialized to Japanese social ethics and aesthetics beyond mere pragmatic purposes. Related to the second finding, Japanese language learning offers a way of claiming an imagined Chinese identity through a shared past of Confucian tradition. Many Japanese-speaking Hongkongers perceive ethnic/historical legitimacy in claiming Japanese social ethics/aesthetics to which they have socialized themselves. While this may imply that learning Japanese language in Hong Kong is ultimately traditional, their self-identification and distinction, as well as claims of a romanticized ancient China are a modern project, being fueled by the current sociopolitical and sociocultural tensions between Hong Kong, China, and Japan. This thesis should be of interest to educators of Japanese and other languages who wish for a contextualized understanding of time and effort made by each learner beyond particular cultural or economical appeals. It should also be of interest to researchers of education, linguistics, anthropology, and social science in general who wish to explore language, society, and culture in today’s Hong Kong, where political tensions are rising and where language is implicitly tied to ways in which people are navigating and crafting their social identities.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/sociocultural-analysis-motivation-learning/docview/1943280117/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Kim, Jung Sun",2016,The Effect of Instruction on the Acquisition of Japanese Discourse Marker <i>ndesu</i>,"The present study investigated the effects of explicit pragmatic instruction on the acquisition of the Japanese discourse marker ndesu by second language (L2) learners enrolled in third- and fourth-year Japanese courses at the university level. The research was based on a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest, and delayed posttest design using an experimental group (pragmatically-oriented) and a control group (textbook-based). The present study was specifically designed to examine the effect of a pragmatically-oriented intervention introducing a unified concept of ndesu in which the pragmatic aspect was emphasized (e.g., specific context, speaker’s intention) by comparing it to a textbook-based approach offering several representative functions of ndesu with no mention of how each function is related to each other. The study aimed not only to determine how much the pedagogical intervention facilitated learners’ ability to apply the unified concept of ndesu to the functions they had learned, but also to access their ability to understand the functions not yet introduced. Furthermore, this study explored whether certain critical demographic factors (e.g., course level, duration of stay in Japan, hours of exposure to Japanese culture, and contact hours with native speakers) affected students’ knowledge of ndesu . To investigate the effect and applicability of a pedagogical intervention of ndesu , and the relationship between various factors and knowledge relating to ndesu , two groups were compared to examine the effect of the pedagogical intervention providing a unified concept of ndesu . The pragmatically-oriented group received instruction providing a unified concept of ndesu , whereas the textbook-based group was instructed by following the textbook Nakama (Hatasa, Hatasa, &amp; Makino, 2009) that provided an explanation of each ndesu function. The results showed that both groups had a positive, immediate effect for learning ndesu , that is, explicit ndesu instruction was effective regardless of the type of instruction. Moreover, the pragmatically-oriented instruction group performed better than the textbook-based group in the posttest. Although a short-term effect was shown, a long-term effect was not retained as indicated on the delayed posttest for both groups. For each item type, both groups performed similarly on test items they were familiar with. However, the pragmatically-oriented groups performed significantly better on the items where ndesu should not be used. The result also showed that among the demographic factors (e.g., course level, duration of stay in Japan, hours of exposure to Japanese culture, and contact hours with native speakers), only general proficiency (i.e., course level, pretest score) affected the participants’ previous knowledge and learning of ndesu .", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-instruction-on-acquisition-japanese/docview/1910156852/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Stephenson, Grace Karram",2016,Exploring the Identities of Students at Western Branch- campuses in Malaysia and United Arab Emirates,"Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are rapidly growing economies with diverse ethnic and linguistic populations. In both, the need for skilled labour has increased the importance of higher education for national development goals. Lacking the capacity to provide public higher education for all their citizens both countries have recruited foreign institutions to educate those who do not have access to public higher education. This thesis examines the experiences of students at Australian and British international branch-campuses (IBCs) in the UAE and Malaysia in order to understand the influence that enrolment at an IBC has on students’ identities. Synthesizing the American and European literature on identity and higher education, this thesis conceptualizes identity as the fluctuating social categories that distinguish groups or individuals from one another. The data for this study was collected during five months of fieldwork, employing qualitative interviews with 49 students and 13 administrators/instructors. The majority of student-participants in this study were affiliated with economically powerful, yet politically marginalized minority groups. The findings suggest that Western IBCs promote a new set of identities that differ from those prioritized in the political and social contexts of the UAE and Malaysia. Students perceive that micro-divisions related to ethnicity decrease at an IBC, but new divisions emerge based on ability, language or region. These findings reflect a changing relationship between higher education and identity in the 21st Century. Cross-border higher education is not embedded in a national or local context, nor promotes identities related to those contexts. Instead, students’ identities become linked to their achievements, and thus branch-campuses support students as they forge market-relevant identities. In contexts such as Malaysia and the UAE, this role is significant as IBCs provide peripheral ethnic groups with an alternative pathway to enter the economic sector which is increasingly detached from its political context.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-identities-students-at-western-branch/docview/1883860163/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Harvey, T. Neal",2016,Effects of low pass filtered input on adult non-lexical intonation in second language acquisition,"This study examined the effect of a Low Pass Filter (LPF) on the accuracy of language learners producing intonation contours. Visualization technologies have proven useful in intonation instruction, and increasing pitch movement height and magnitude, while also spectrally limiting the speech stream may provide ways to raise the salience of intonation for learners as well. Nineteen participants were provided a pre and posttest between which they received either LPF training, Non-Filtered training, or no training. All input was given using the characteristics of Infant Directed Speech, providing, among other features, increased pitch movement height and magnitude. It was predicted that the LPF training would increase the accuracy of learners. The LPF did not significantly increase accuracy in intonation contour production, although focused training on intonation showed a significant increase in accuracy over no training at all.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-low-pass-filtered-input-on-adult-non/docview/1867573999/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lasan, Ivan",2016,EFL learners' perceptions of (in)formality: Address forms in interaction with other (in)formal register markers,"Perception and production of stylistic variation is an important aspect of sociolinguistic and pragmatic competence. Whereas most research has focused on the production of (in)formal variants by native speakers, this study compares perceptions of formality by English-dominant (ED) speakers and advanced English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) learners measured on a 5-point Likert scale for 20 examples of e-mail workplace communications in which (in)formal greetings, address forms, and vocabulary are variously combined as three register markers. Participants also reported how certain they felt about their formality ratings on a 4-point Likert scale, and identified features that they considered significant in their perceptions of formality. Statistically significant differences between the two participant groups emerged in 11 of the formality and 12 of the certainty ratings. A trend which needs to be substantiated by further research was observed suggesting that the EFL learners found address forms more and vocabulary less salient than the ED speakers.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/efl-learners-perceptions-formality-address-forms/docview/1864735961/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Mihi, Park",2016,Third language acquisition among early bilinguals,"This dissertation primarily investigates the acquisition of a third language (L3) by early bilinguals with a special focus on the acquisition of morphosyntactic features. Three studies that investigated the role of potential factors, such as a formal L2 experience, home language, L3 proficiency and structural familiarity, in L3 through experimental and corpus-based methodologies are reported here. To examine the potential role of transfer in L3 acquisition by investigating typological proximity, an untimed grammaticality judgment task measures explicit knowledge of nominative and accusative Korean case-marking in four different argument structures (e.g., intransitive, transitive, etc.). The learners with any prior formal L2 experience (EBLs+L2) were further subdivided into those with experience studying Japanese versus those without Japanese experience. Although specific experience with Japanese may convey slight advantages, EBLs+L2, regardless of typological proximity to Korean, significantly outperformed EBLs. These findings suggest that EBLs+L2 are generally advantaged in L3 study, not because of transfer from typologically similar languages, but due to generally enhanced metalinguistic awareness. The results of examination on the role of L3 proficiency indicate that the benefit of prior L2 experience is strongest at the initial stage of L3 learning. At the initial stage of learning, prior formal language study experience allows learners to be equipped with enhanced sensitivity to new linguistic inputs, which facilitates learning of syntactic features, even those used in structures that are unfamiliar to the learner. In addition, the advantage of L2 learning experiences was not limited only in acquiring obligatory grammatical features but it could be extended to learning sociolinguistic variations in L3. The study that examined the acquisition of variation in argument realisation involving such case-marking found that EBLs+L2 patterned more closely to native speakers in variation of argument realisation. Native speakers of Korean vary in argument realisation between full NP with explicit case marker, full NP with dropped case marker, and covert NP, depending on the sociolinguistic and discourse context. This study, using a variationist sociolinguistic framework, investigates whether prior experience with formal study of an L2 influences Korean learners’ Type 1 variation (i.e., correct versus incorrect argument realization) and Type 2 variation (i.e., variation between alternative acceptable variants). The results showed that the Type 2 variation patterns of EBLs+L2 were found to more closely mirror the patterns of their classroom input as compared to EBLs, suggesting that students with prior formal L2 learning experience have enhanced sensitivity to Type 2 variation. Specifically, significant differences were found between the two learner groups for sentence structures that are unique to the L3 and thus unfamiliar to learners. However, both groups performed comparably in terms of Type 1 variation with a partial advantage in accusative marking, meaning that they produced the same proportion of correct versus incorrect tokens generally. This study demonstrates that, in addition to previously demonstrated benefits for acquisition of grammatical competence, prior language learning experience may facilitate acquisition of variation patterns and thus enhance sociolinguistic competence in a third language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/third-language-acquisition-among-early-bilinguals/docview/1858156275/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shleykina, Galina",2016,The speech act of greeting performed by Russian EFL learners,"The present study centers on interlanguage and cross-cultural pragmatics. It investigates semantic formulas in the speech act of greeting performed by Russian EFL learners. In particular, it compares the non-native speakers’ (NNS) and native speakers’ (NS) production of semantic formulas in terms of their number, frequency, and content. Secondly, the study examines the NSs’ perception of NNS greetings for their pragmatic appropriateness and identifies areas that influence the ratings. A Free Discourse Completion Test (FDCT) containing 16 situational prompts was used to elicit greetings by the English NNSs and NSs. Retrospective interviews were additionally administered to triangulate the data. The NNSs’ greetings were rated by the NS raters on a four-point scale for their pragmatic appropriateness. The results show that the NNSs significantly deviate from the NSs in terms of number, frequency, and content of greetings strategies, namely, greetings proper, phatic questions and phrases, address terms, and situational greetings. The differences result from negative pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic transfer, lack of appropriate linguistic means, or not fully developed pragmatic competence. The NNS greetings were rated as pragmatically appropriate in general; however, several areas including grammatical and sociopragmatic factors led to lowering the scores. The NSs’ ratings as well as NNSs’ production can be regarded in view of socio-cultural differences in communication styles between Russian and English cultures. These dissimilarities in sociopragmatic behavior may account for low ratings from the NSs’ perspective and for frequencies of certain semantic formulas in the NNSs’ production as well. Finally, important pedagogical implications regarding pragmatic instruction are discussed. The results contribute to a better understanding of how Russian EFL learners greet and respond to greetings in English. They also shed light on the discussion of L2 learners’ pragmatic competence and NS perception of pragmatic appropriateness.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/speech-act-greeting-performed-russian-efl/docview/1853871241/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Bernau, Toshiko",2016,Japanese Language Teaching in High School and Use of Multiple Intelligences Theory,"Research indicates that to accommodate students’ diversity in learning ability, teachers who utilize all eight Multiple Intelligences (MI) have demonstrated better student performance. Studies indicate that all eight MI are important; however, there is a need to investigate whether all eight intelligences are being represented equally in the classroom. The purpose of this quantitative correlational study is to examine the extent each of the eight MI is utilized in a classroom curriculum and to determine whether any demographic variables are associated with MI use. The participants were 127 high school Japanese language teachers in the USA who were contacted via emails and invited to answer a survey through Qualtrics. The survey instrument, The MI-inspired Teaching Strategy Index (MITSI), developed by Huang (2005), was used to measure the eight MI outcome and the predictor variables, gender, academic qualifications, and teaching experience. Once the surveys were obtained, the results were analyzed through statistical software SPSS version 24.0. To test each teacher’s utilization of the MI, multivariate tests with pairwise comparisons were conducted comparing each of the eight MI variables at a 95% confidence interval ( p &lt; .05). The results identified that the strongest teaching strategy among Japanese teachers was the Interpersonal intelligence teaching strategy, and the weakest was the Naturalistic intelligence teaching strategy. The relationship between a teacher's demographic variable and the usage of MI was tested by using a multivariate analysis of variance. The results of the present study indicated that female teachers utilize more Kinesthetic intelligence teaching strategies than do male teachers. Teachers with less than five years of teaching experience used fewer spatial intelligence teaching strategies than did teachers with more teaching experience. The survey results suggested the guidance to the Japanese teaching community on the strengths and weaknesses of MI implementation and where further MI training is most needed and beneficial at the national, regional, or local level. However, overall, participants in this study had a largely positive attitude toward MI teaching that is to meet the needs of their students’ learning preferences and to create the lesson that emphasizes each student’s diversity of learning. The continued research in depth is recommended further to investigate the relationship between teachers' MI profile and their teaching strategies and conduct the similar research on middle school Japanese teachers in the USA., and the schools in other countries that the Japanese language is largely taught.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/japanese-language-teaching-high-school-use/docview/1853475002/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kim, Hyun-Jin",2016,Sentence processing and the L2 acquisition of the semantics and discourse function of the English past progressive,"Previous research has found that learners’ use of tense-aspect morphology is strongly dependent on the aspectual semantics of the verb phrase. However, the processes underlying the acquisition of semantic values of aspectual morphemes are still not well understood. I investigated the acquisition of the semantics of the progressive morphology -ing in past progressive sentences by second language (L2) learners from the point of view of learning as a by-product of the parsing task. The central research question is: How is a semantic value for aspectual -ing computed and identified in L2 sentence processing? Two learning-theoretic hypotheses were formulated: (1) the predicate-based semantics selection hypothesis representing hypothesis-testing and (2) the transition-based semantics selection hypothesis representing a deductive learning. L2 learners of intermediate and advanced English proficiency from typologically different L1s, Korean and Chinese, were engaged in a written film retell, a verb cloze, a judgment task, and two online processing tasks (garden-path and ellipsis tasks). Across tasks, the results showed coherent patterns distinguishing learners by proficiency but not by L1 background. In processing by higher-proficiency learners, the -ing morphology resulted in the anticipation of activity predicates. Learners’ narratives associated -ing and -ed morphology with activities and accomplishment respectively. In processing by lower-proficiency learners, the -ing morphology resulted in the anticipation of an accomplishment predicate. Their production behavior did not show the strong association of -ing morphology with activities. These patterns suggest deductive computations involving a set of transitions in an event schema that includes a culmination. The lower proficiency learners failed to complete all transitions to progressive states/process stages in the processing of past progressive sentences. The higher proficiency group’s recovery of analysis, in contrast, signals the reliable computation of progressive states/process stages semantics for past progressive sentences. The findings emphasize the role of deductive parsing in the acquisition of tense and aspect.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/sentence-processing-l2-acquisition-semantics/docview/1848288668/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Burch, Alfred Rue",2016,Motivation in interaction: A conversation-analytic perspective,"Over the past decade, the field of L2 motivation research has begun to turn its focus toward what Dörnyei and Ushioda (2010) have termed “socio-complexity” approaches, following recent trends in the wider field of SLA that incorporate discursive and usage-based methodologies (Atkinson, 2011; Cadierno &amp; Eskildsen, 2015; Firth &amp; Wagner, 1997; 2007; Ortega, 2013). These socio-complexity approaches, including Ushioda’s (2009) “person-in-context” perspective, Dörnyei’s (2005; 2009) “L2 motivation self system” and various Complexity/ Dynamic Systems Theory (CDST) approaches (Dörnyei, 2014; Dörnyei, MacIntyre &amp; Henry, 2015; MacIntyre, 2012; MacIntyre &amp; Legatto, 2011), though eclectic in focus and methodology, have all begun to step away from the assumptions of context as background variable and individual differences as psychological traits that have dominated much of the previous L2 motivation research, to instead view motivation as dynamically changing and socially contextualized on multiple timescales, and more importantly, have come to recognize that “L2 learner” is just one of many potentially relevant situated identities (Zimmerman, 1998) for those interacting in their L2s (Firth &amp; Wagner, 1997; Ushioda, 2009). This study contributes to this dynamic and contextualized perspective at the interactional time scale by utilizing EMCA (Ethnomethodology/Conversation Analysis) as it has been applied to second language acquisition (or CA-SLA; see Kasper &amp; Wagner, 2011; 2014)—including sequential analysis (Schegloff, 2007), membership categorization analysis (Fitzgerald &amp; Housley, 2015; Stokoe, 2012), discursive psychology (Edwards &amp; Potter, 1992; 2005) and a focus on embodied interaction (Streeck, Goodwin &amp; LeBaron, 2011)—to analyze mundane Japanese as a Second Language interactions. The data follows Peony, an L2 speaker of Japanese, in video recordings of interactions between her and her L1 speaking friends and family collected over the course of 13 months. The analysis focuses on the actions and interactional projects that Peony and her co-participants undertake and co-construct, and takes into account the linguistic, embodied, and material resources that they employ, in order to develop a perspective that focuses on motivation as socially viewable, accountable, and accomplished. In particular, this study focuses on three aspects of motivation-in-interaction: 1) persistence , or the sustained orientation (often through interactional difficulty) toward an interactional goal, 2) initiative , or engagement and participation at points where it would not be noticeably absent or accountable to not engage, and 3) motivation as topic , focusing on Peony’s self-assessments of her Japanese ability and her accounts regarding the efforts she makes towards studying the language. The analysis reveals that while there are indeed times that Peony’s effort is oriented toward specific learning objects, much of her effort is exerted towards other situated identities such as being an attentive friend or family member. Furthermore, the sequential nature of persistence and engagement, and Peony’s relationships with her co-participants on one hand, and the relationships with others that are invoked in her conversations, with their concomitant category bound rights and obligations on the other, make clear that motivation at the interactional level is very much a matter of mundane morality (Jayussi, 1984; 1991).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/motivation-interaction-conversation-analytic/docview/1847950575/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Xu, Jun",2016,An analysis of the Japanese sentence final particle <i> yone</i>,"The Japanese sentence final particle yone is commonly used as a tag-like question corresponding to “isn’t it?” or “right?” in English. yone is also commonly used to show agreement. Another sentence final particle, ne , is considered as sharing those two functions with yone . However, they are not always interchangeable because there are cases in which yone or ne is the only possible choice; the alternate choice results in an unnatural utterance. This indicates that a simple description of the functions of yone as a tag-like question or showing agreement cannot provide a clear picture of its use. Situated in a discourse and functional framework, the present study analyzes the use of yone as a tag-like question and response with invented and naturally occurring conversation data. The present study argues that when yone is used as a tag-like question, it is associated with explicit or implied cognitive or interactional incongruity while ne encodes that the speaker assumes no difference of understanding or knowledge between conversation participants. Three types of incongruity have been identified in the present study. Type I and Type II are associated with an incongruity of the speaker’s understanding or an existing incongruity because the information belongs more to the hearer than the speaker. Type I indicates that the speaker is not completely certain about the information while in Type II the speaker feels completely certain about the information. yone is used because the information belongs more to the hearer. Type III is associated with a disalignment between the speaker and interactant. yone is used when disalignment appears and the speaker feels the necessity to seek support from the addressee to justify one’s position. Type III also appears in a situation where the addressee does not respond to what the speaker asks or requests. When yone is used in responses, including showing agreement, it indicates the speaker’s previously held recognition while ne presents the speaker’s here-and-now recognition. Examples are examined in four situations: i) response to immediate situations; ii) response to the speaker’s already-known information; iii) response to the answer to a question; and iv) response to assessment.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/analysis-japanese-sentence-final-particle-i-yone/docview/1845890554/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shoji, Shinichi",2016,The Repeated Name Penalty and the Overt Pronoun Penalty in Japanese,"This research investigated the Repeated Name Penalty (RNP) and the Overt Pronoun Penalty (OPP) in Japanese. The RNP was first reported by Gordon, Grosz and Gilliom (1993), who observed that English sentences with repeated-name subject anaphors were read slower than sentences with overt-pronoun subjects when the antecedents were either the grammatical subject or the first-mentioned surface-initial noun phrase of the previous sentence. The OPP has been reported in studies of Spanish (Gelormini-Lezama &amp; Almor, 2011) in which sentences with overt-pronoun subject anaphors were read slower than sentences with null-pronoun subject anaphors for subject antecedents. A concern with the RNP and OPP is that, in most previously tested languages, the grammatical subject of a sentence is typically also its discourse topic. Thus, it remains unclear whether these effects are attributable to the anaphors’ subject-hood or to their topic-hood. To address this question, the present study examined the RNP and the OPP in Japanese, a language that distinctly utilizes the topic-subject and non-topic-subject. In addition, while the existing studies controlled saliences of antecedents by grammatical status (i.e., subject vs. object), the present study utilized the information-structurally different antecedents, namely topic vs. non-topic (both were grammatical subjects in this dissertation study), and the non-linguistic aspects, empathy locus vs. non-empathy locus (both were grammatical subjects in this dissertation study). The present study consisted of six self-paced sentence-by-sentence reading experiments with native Japanese speakers. The results showed that when antecedents were subjects or objects, the RNP and the OPP were detected only when anaphors were non-topic with the nominative-postposition, ga, but not topic anaphors with the topic-postposition, wa. The outcomes indicate that the topic-hood of anaphors activated immediate anaphoric interpretation. In contrast, when the antecedents were the topic or non-topic, the processing of anaphors with wa showed a marginal RNP, and anaphors with ga elicited no RNP. The results are attributed to the differences in salience between the antecedents and the function of the postpositions. Finally, although the different empathy statuses of antecedents elicited neither the RNP nor OPP, a closer examination of the results found a marginal OPP, likely reflecting the anti-logophoricity of overt pronouns in Japanese. Overall, these results indicate that the topic-hood of anaphors should be considered in studies of the RNP and OPP and that the saliences of antecedents may be dependent on non-grammatical aspects such as discourse topic or empathy status in addition to grammatical status.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/repeated-name-penalty-overt-pronoun-japanese/docview/1845018035/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kang, Tingting",2016,Effectiveness of strategy instruction using podcasts in second language listening and speaking,"Mobile devices have become a significant part of students’ lives. The average number of hours that college students reported using their smartphones each day was nine hours—more than half of their daily waking hours (Roberts, Yaya, &amp; Manolis, 2014). Although software developers and teachers have started to develop and incorporate various mobile applications to promote teaching and learning, as Egan wrote, “the best of technology does not by itself create a productive learning environment” (1999, p. 281). Applying suitable and effective instructional techniques in mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) is crucial. Podcasts, one type of MALL, have been proposed as a technological tool to improve second language (L2) learners’ listening and speaking skills (e.g., Ducate &amp; Lomicka, 2009; O’Bryan &amp; Hegelheimer, 2009). Such improvement might be achieved by using teaching methods that include self-regulated listening and self-awareness strategies in order to guide students toward autonomous learning (e.g., Alderson, 2005; Roussel, 2011). This dissertation study evaluated the effectiveness of incorporating self-regulated and awareness strategies with podcast activities in an integrated listening and speaking English as a second language (ESL) class. Participants were 20 intermediate ESL learners enrolled in an intensive English program (IEP) at a southwestern American university. The treatment length was 12 weeks. This study employed a quasi-experimental research design. Two independent variables were time (within-subjects factor) and group (between-subjects factor). Six dependent variables included listening skills, speaking skills, attitudes, self-regulation, self-awareness, and use of podcasts. A series of mixed-method comparisons were conducted to analyze two groups’ performances on the pre-, post- and delayed post-measures. Additionally, participants’ weekly listening logs and speaking performances were charted across weeks to examine trends. Results revealed that (a) both groups improved significantly on listening and speaking achievement tests, (b) no statistical differences were observed between groups on the listening, speaking, and strategy measures, (c) the experimental group’s listening comprehension was slightly better and more stable than the comparison group’s, (d) the experimental group produced slightly slower and more comprehensible speech, and (e) both groups showed positive attitudes towards the podcast activities. This dissertation study provided empirical research support on the effectiveness of instructional techniques using podcasts, perfected podcast activities in L2 classes, provided important information about students’ preference and ownership of different technology devices, and motivated L2 learners to take advantage of authentic materials outside the classroom.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effectiveness-strategy-instruction-using-podcasts/docview/1808501344/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hara, Yoshiyuki",2016,The Perceptions of the Japanese Imperfective Aspect Marker –<i>Teiru</i> among Native Speakers and L2 Learners of Japanese,"The Japanese imperfective aspect marker –teiru is one of the most widely researched tense/aspect markers because of its multiple semantic functions. It has been claimed that the –teiru form can describe two main aspectual meanings, progressive and resultative, depending on the lexical aspect of the attached verb. The present study aims to empirically investigate native speakers’ interpretations of the –teiru meaning with different verb and sentence types through a judgment test. It compares them with the predicted semantic categories from the previous studies, which based their conclusion upon introspective analysis, as well as perceptions of L2 Japanese learners. The results suggest that overall perceptional patterns are consistent with predicted descriptions but also that interpretations of the meaning are flexible to some extent. As for learners’ perceptions, the results indicate that L2 learners develop progressive semantic processing in Japanese faster than resultative semantic processing in Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/perceptions-japanese-imperfective-aspect-marker-i/docview/1808261295/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

To find learning evidence, a systematic review of empirical studies entailing books and articles published between 2004 and 2015 was conducted. The participants of the studies were second language learners, foreign language learners, native speakers of the target language, users of English as a lingua franca, or language learners in multilingual and multicultural contexts. For the descriptive mapping stage, features of the context of each study were coded according to a coding scheme and analyzed quantitatively using descriptive statistics. The findings of studies conducted only in university contexts were in-depth reviewed inductively according to the review questions. Analysis of the data suggests that Web 2.0 tools and applications have a beneficial impact on learners’ ICC but future research should focus on multimodality, methodological triangulation, less commonly taught languages, and the K–12 context.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/research-synthesis-systematic-review-impact-web-2/docview/1801960917/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Smith, Megan",2016,Testing the shallow structure hypothesis in L2 Japanese,"Language processing heuristics are one of the possible sources of divergence between first and second language systems. The Shallow Structure Hypothesis (SSH) (Clahsen and Felser, 2006) proposes that non-native language processing relies primarily on semantic, and not syntactic, information, and that second language (L2) processing is therefore necessarily less sensitive to syntactic constraints than native language (L1) processing. The SSH further predicts that regardless of whether a participant’s L1 and L2 instantiate the same structure, L2 processing will always be less sensitive to structural constraints. The present dissertation tests these claims in non-native Japanese processing. L1 English and L1 Korean speakers completed a self-paced reading task that tested their ability to rely on case particles to project clause structure in relative clauses, their sensitivity to wh- dependencies, and their ambiguity resolution preferences. Results suggest that L1 English and L1 Korean speakers rely on case particles to project structure, but that they diverge from native Japanese speakers with respect to whether projecting a second clause facilitates the processing of the head noun of the relative clause. Results also suggest that both groups of L2 Japanese speakers are sensitive to wh- dependencies in canonical wh- biclausal sentences, but only the L1 English group is in the scrambled ones. Ambiguity resolution preferences for both L2 groups converge on native-like preferences. These results are incompatible with the predictions of the SSH. The role of L2 literacy and syntactic knowledge in language processing is also discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/testing-shallow-structure-hypothesis-l2-japanese/docview/1793940458/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tobin, Stephen James",2015,Phonetic Accommodation in Spanish-English and Korean-English Bilinguals: a Dynamical Account,"Recent research reveals that pronunciation converges in verbal interaction (Babel, 2012), but this varies between speakers (Pardo, 2006). Based on dynamical principles I predict differences in bilinguals’ accommodation towards English voice-onset-time (VOT). VOT is a phase relation between two articulatory gestures measuring the time between oral closure release and voicing initiation. Dynamical systems research shows that synchronous (in-phase) timing of finger/limb actions is more stable than asynchronous (anti-phase) timing (Kelso, 1981). Browman and Goldstein (1992) propose this principle for speech. Near-zero VOTs reflect gestural synchrony, whereas long-lag VOTs reflect asynchrony (cf. data from Fuchs [2005]). I hypothesized that native Korean speakers’ aspirated stops (VOT=~120 ms) would more readily accommodate than native Spanish speakers’ voiceless stops (VOT=~20 ms) towards English voiceless stops (VOT=~70 ms; Lisker &amp; Abramson, 1964). I also hypothesized that perception changes would parallel production, extending the concept of parity (Liberman &amp; Whalen, 2000). Additionally, I predicted that intermediate phonetic-proficiency second-language (L2) English speakers would accommodate more than those of high/low proficiency. Both languages should influence a bilingual’s L2-English phonetic categories if they are equidistant between corresponding English and L1 categories. Spanish- and Korean-English bilinguals shadowed American English [k]-initial words. Before (Baseline) and during (Test) shadowing, participants completed speech production (word reading) or perception tasks (goodness judgments; Allen &amp; Miller, 2001). In production, the Korean-English group’s unstable VOTs reduced significantly towards typical English, while the Spanish-English group’s stable VOTs did not change, supporting the hypothesis. Low phonetic-proficiency speakers accommodated most, and high proficiency speakers least. In perception, no language- or proficiency-specific shifts obtained in category centers. However, bilinguals’ perceptual categories expanded, whereas monolinguals’ category narrowed. Although perception did not parallel production shifts, parallels were found between the similarity of L1 VOTs to English VOT and expansion vs. narrowing of their categories. The production results support the hypothesis that zero VOT constitutes a stable attractor, but the perception results do not, possibly because the perception task involved judgment. However, bilinguals’ perceptual category expansion and monolinguals’ category narrowing can be explained by the dynamical phenomenon of detuning.

We provide data that help choose between two prevailing accounts of prominence, the first which attributes prosodic reduction to low-level activation (Accessibility Theory , e.g. Arnold and Watson 2015), and the second which attributes it to a syntactic operator that requires an antecedent, much like a pronoun (Anaphoric Theory , Rooth 1992, Wagner and Klassen 2015). Our English production data show that native English speakers shift prominence in the sentence according to the contrast that speakers intend to convey, using additional adverbs which are only compatible with certain choices in antecedents. We argue that this can only be accounted for by the Anaphoric Theory. With respect to the differences in prosodic focus marking between English and Spanish (and, tentatively, Germanic and Romance more generally), we show that the crosslinguistic differences can be explained by a syntactic-semantic account: the scope of the focus domain in Spanish must be wide, encompassing the entire speech act, while in English it can scope over smaller constituents, as expected based on the Scope Hypothesis (vander Klok et al. 2014). Additionally, the observation in Ladd (2008) that focus in Spanish must be correctional in nature, may indeed be correct, meaning that the interpretation of the focus operator in Romance is also restricted in addition to its scope. What is more, our data show that the differences between English and Spanish focus marking cannot be explained by phonological constraints on phrasing. Using our L1 hypotheses about the crosslinguistic variation of prosodic focus as a starting point, we form a hypothesis regarding the L2 acquisition of prosodic focus, based on standard assumptions about the availability of evidence in L2 (White 2003). We suggest that English speakers have issues with Spanish prosodic stress shift because its use is constrained to a narrow set of contexts. Therefore, in order to acquire the specific restrictions (i.e. only corrective contexts), learners must integrate two separate pieces of evidence, or else they may simply posit the existence of two grammars, resulting in optionality. Our production data support this hypothesis. After this, we examine the online processing of English cataphoric prosodic focus by Spanish native speakers– the nature of L2 processing being a debated issue (Kaan 2014). We show that L1 transfer plays a role in L2 processing of prosodic focus: Spanish-speaking learners of English are able to take into account prosodic cues during the processing of an English sentence only when these cues are similarly used in Spanish. We do not find evidence for different processing strategies between native and non-native speakers of English.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-focus-prosody-english/docview/2519249300/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Okuma, Tokiko",2015,Overt Pronoun Constraint Effects in Second Language Japanese,"This dissertation investigates the applicability of the Full Transfer/Full Access hypothesis (FT/FA) (Schwartz &amp; Sprouse, 1994, 1996) by investigating the interpretation of the Japanese pronoun (kare ‘he’) by adult English and Spanish speaking learners of Japanese. The Japanese, Spanish, and English languages differ with respect to interpretive properties of pronouns. In Japanese and Spanish, overt pronouns disallow a bound variable interpretation in subject and object positions. By contrast, In English, overt pronouns may have a bound variable interpretation in these positions. This is called the Overt Pronoun Constraint (OPC) (Montalbetti, 1984). The FT/FA model suggests that the initial state of L2 grammar is the end state of L1 grammar and that the restructuring of L2 grammar occurs with L2 input. This hypothesis predicts that L1 English speakers of L2 Japanese would initially allow a bound variable interpretation of Japanese pronouns in subject and object positions, transferring from their L1s. Nevertheless, they will successfully come to disallow a bound variable interpretation as their proficiency improves. In contrast, L1 Spanish speakers of L2 Japanese would correctly disallow a bound variable interpretation of Japanese pronouns in subject and object positions from the beginning. In order to test these predictions, L1 English and L1 Spanish speakers of L2 Japanese at intermediate and advanced levels of proficiency were compared with native Japanese speakers in their interpretations of pronouns with quantified antecedents in two tasks. To make the comparison, the interpretation of pronouns with referential antecedents, which do not obey the constraint, was also investigated. The results support the FT/FA hypothesis in two respects. First, the intermediate English group accepted a bound variable interpretation of subject pronouns more often than the native Japanese speakers while the intermediate Spanish group did not. Moreover, the intermediate English group was not sensitive to the referential/quantified antecedent asymmetry in interpreting subject pronouns while the intermediate Spanish group showed sensitivity. These differences are attributable to their L1s, English, which does not demonstrate the OPC effects, and Spanish, which does, just like Japanese. Second, the advanced English group as well as the advanced Spanish group showed evidence of a target-like grammar, suggesting the OPC effects in their grammars. Given that the OPC effects are underdetermined in input, these results suggest that Universal Grammar (UG) is operative in L2 acquisition.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/overt-pronoun-constraint-effects-second-language/docview/2518083793/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Barney, Keiko Moriyama",2015,Identifying and Understanding the Difference Between Japanese and English when Giving Walking Directions,"In order to better identify and understand the differences between Japanese and English, the task of giving walking directions was used. Japanese and American public facilities (10 each) were randomly chosen from which to collect data over the phone in order to examine these differences based on the following five communication styles: 1) politeness, 2) indirectness, 3) self-effacement, 4) back-channel feedback (Aizuchi), 5) and other linguistic and cognitive differences in relation to space and giving directions. The study confirmed what the author reviewed in the literature: Japanese are more polite, English speakers tend to give directions simply and precisely, Japanese prefer pictorial information and most Americans prefer linguistic information, Japanese is a topic-oriented language and also an addressee-oriented language. The information revealed from this study will help Japanese learners develop important skills needed for developing proficiency in the target language and also teach important differences between the two languages.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/identifying-understanding-difference-between/docview/2490097400/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Furniss, Edie A.",2015,A Web-Based Instructional Module for the Teaching of Routine Formulas in Russian,"Pragmatic competence comprises an essential component of proficiency: it enables speakers to use and interpret language appropriately in varied contexts. The use of technological applications for teaching pragmatics is on the rise (Taguchi &amp; Sykes, 2013), in part because those applications are well-suited to the types of awareness-raising tasks that support Schmidt's (1993; 2001) noticing hypothesis. However, the potential for technology in the instruction of routine formulas has yet to be examined. Furthermore, there has thus far been no research on the intersection of pragmatics and technology in the instruction of Russian. Russian pedagogical materials rarely present routine formulas, which communicate pragmatic meaning in social interaction, in a thorough manner. This dissertation reports on the impact of an awarenessraising, corpus-referred instructional website on L2 Russian learners' acquisition of nine routine formulas, selected with reference to analyses of corpus data and popular textbooks of Russian. Intermediate and advanced L1 English learners of Russian were assigned to either an experimental ( n = 18) or control ( n = 16) group. An oral proficiency assessment and background questionnaire were used to collect information on participants. Pre-/post-/delayed post-tests assessed knowledge and aural recognition of the targeted routine formulas. Experimental group participants completed online instructional modules that provided information on the form, function, and typical contexts of these formulas, along with authentic examples of usage (Russian National Corpus excerpts and film clips) and opportunities for practice. Data on the experimental group participants' experience with the routine formulas and reactions to the instructional website were collected via an online feedback form and retrospective interviews. Results indicate that the intervention had a durable effect on learners' knowledge of the targeted routine formulas. However, aural comprehension was not affected. Participants who used the website reported that it increased their awareness of the routine formulas and their functions in conversation. Use of the formulas was found to be contingent on many factors, particularly context and relationships with interlocutors. This study demonstrates the potential for pedagogical interventions that explicitly instruct pragmatics and for the use of corpus methodologies in pragmatics-focused technological applications, especially for languages other than English.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/web-based-instructional-module-teaching-routine/docview/1986240194/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Takeuchi, Jae DiBello",2015,Dialect Matters: L2 Speakers' Beliefs and Perceptions About Japanese Dialect,"This qualitative interview study investigates the dialect-related beliefs and perceptions of second language (L2) speakers of Japanese who were JET Programme participants living and working in Ehime, Japan. The dialects of Ehime differ significantly from Standard Japanese and can pose problems to someone unfamiliar with them. In local communities such as those in Ehime, in addition to Standard Japanese, L2 speakers often encounter Japanese Dialect and must negotiate its understanding and use. Conducted within a constructivist framework, this study draws on theories of linguistic ideologies (Silverstein, 1979), linguistic capital (Bourdieu, 1991), and L2 identity and investment (Norton, 2000/2013, 2006), and seeks to understand the relevance of dialect from the perspective of L2 speakers. The study examines how L2 participants’ stances toward dialect use compared to those of their Japanese counterparts. The study also considers whether dialect functions as linguistic capital for L2 speakers and whether dialect-as-linguistic-capital differs for L2 speakers in comparison to first language (L1) speakers. Participants were 20 L2 speakers of Japanese and 24 L1 speakers of Japanese. All L2 participants had been living in Japan for a year or more at the time of the study. Data include background questionnaires, open-ended, semi-structured interviews in participants’ first languages (i.e., English or Japanese), and observations of participants’ daily life activities. All L2 participants encountered dialect and negotiated complex linguistic choices about whether to use it. For L2 speakers who live and work in Japan, such as the L2 participants in this study, dialect matters for how they understand the speech used around them and for how they perform their identities as they navigate local communities. By examining how L2 speakers negotiate choices between standard and dialect, this study expands our knowledge of the role of non-standard varieties for L2 speakers. Theoretical contributions are made to research in sociolinguistics and second language acquisition (SLA) regarding L2 identity and how speakers negotiate linguistic choices in Japanese; the findings also extend the conceptualization of linguistic capital for L2 speakers. Broader implications for the field of SLA and for the teaching and learning of Japanese as a Foreign Language are also considered.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/dialect-matters-l2-speakers-beliefs-perceptions/docview/1939991555/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Oda Nuske, Tomoko",2017,Reconceptualizing study abroad: American and Japanese university students' subjective construction of identity through language learning abroad,"Study abroad is an under-researched domain of language learning. Moreover, most investigations of this phenomenon adopt traditional structuralist approaches, wherein outcomes of study abroad are assessed solely in terms of proficiency gains as measured through conventional exams. The present study builds upon an emerging body of poststructuralist research that foregrounds connections between language study abroad and the reconstruction of learners’ identities (e.g., Block, 2007; Kinginger, 2010). More specifically, it utilizes Kramsch’s (2009) notion of subjectivity to argue that language learning is a phenomenon that affects the entire human being (Hanauer, 2012) while bringing focus to how learners themselves define and evaluate the successfulness of their study abroad experiences. The study adopted a longitudinal mixed-method approach encompassing interviews, narrative essay writing, and poetry writing tasks to investigate how perceptions of self and language learning evolved among Americans studying Japanese in Japan (n=9) and Japanese studying English in the United States (n=10). The specific research questions were: 1. How do students’ subjective understandings of language learning and study abroad experiences involve views of the self? 2. In collecting data on personal experience in different genres (narrative interview, narrative essay writing, and poetry writing), what are the values and qualities of each of the data elicitation methods used? Individuals who most consistently provided all three data types (4 Americans; 3 Japanese) were selected for qualitative case studies. Results demonstrated that their understandings of their experiences abroad changed according to idiosyncratic dynamics, yet they all eventually viewed their experiences abroad as significant life transitions into adulthood. Some derived great meaning from moments when they were able to use the target language in authentic situations outside the classroom, while others abandoned language learning and determined other goals for their study abroad. Quantitative analysis of the entire dataset made use of a computational linguistic approach to systematically measure the degrees of expressivity present in the corpus of texts in each genre. The study concludes by recommending the establishment of a system of routine mentoring sessions or conferences wherein study abroad learners are provided with more opportunities to contemplate the meanings of their ongoing language learning experiences.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/reconceptualizing-study-abroad-american-japanese/docview/1884298285/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Maimone, Luciane L.",2017,"The Role of Crosslinguistic Influence From L2 Spanish, Type of Linguistic Item, and Aptitude in the Learning Stages of L3 Portuguese Forms: An Exploratory Study","This study investigates facilitative and non-facilitative crosslinguistic influence (CLI) from second language (L2) Spanish in third language (L3) Portuguese learning by native English speakers, testing some of the hypotheses of L3 acquisition models. To assess CLI effects on the intake and learning of Portuguese forms by novice Portuguese learners, the performance of L2 Spanish speakers was compared to that of non-Spanish speaking learners. The study also addresses the question of how CLI affects the intake and learning of lexical versus morphosyntactic items. While this study does not pinpoint the exact mechanisms affected by CLI during input processing, it approaches CLI from a cognitive perspective, going beyond the simple verification of transfer and looking at prior knowledge as a cognitive factor in interaction with the analytical components of aptitude, operationalized as grammatical sensitivity and grammar inferencing. It also looks at how CLI affects different learning stages, following Leow's (2015a) model of the L2 learning process in ISLA. Participants underwent laboratory learning conditions and were assessed at three points in time. Results confirmed non-facilitative CLI from Spanish in the recognition and production of lexical items and irregular past participles, and positive CLI from Spanish in the recognition and production of regular past participles, partially supporting the Typological Proximity Model (TPM) (Rothman, 2010) and the Scalpel Model (Slabakova, 2016). Results also showed that CLI affected different learning stages similarly, and that differential performance on lexical versus morphosyntactic items was mediated by verb morphology and prior language knowledge. Aptitude only correlated positively with overall accuracy and agreement in the production of regular verb forms, with no mitigating effects on negative CLI.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-crosslinguistic-influence-l2-spanish-type/docview/1901490664/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hannouchi, Said",2017,"Likely, Comfortable, and Appropriate Behaviors in Arab Cultural Interactions: Perceptions of First-semester College Learners and Moroccan Native Speakers of Arabic","This dissertation uses empirical (questionnaire &amp; interview) data to contribute to the theoretical conceptualization of intercultural competence in foreign language learners. Specifically, this study describes and compares how native speakers (NSs) and non-native speakers (NNSs) of Arabic perceive a variety of cultural products, practices, and perceptions associated with Morocco. What is more, the study also explores the expectations that NSs and NNSs hold of themselves and each other in inter- and intra-cultural encounters. The study explores in depth the following assumptions that frequently shape pedagogical practices: (1) That NSs expect NNSs to comply with the NSs perspective when the NNSs interact with NSs; and (2) that NNSs feel obliged to adopt NSs norms of cultural appropriateness and furthermore desire to meet these obligations. The study included 52 Moroccan NSs of Arabic and 31 American college students learning Arabic in the first semester at a large Midwestern research university. Learners of Arabic rated 148 and Moroccans rated 117 items in surveys about cultural norms and projected &amp; preferred behaviors; they also participated in face-to-face interviews. Findings included the following: (1) Learners reported inclinations toward cultural behaviors in Arabic that were significantly misaligned with the behaviors that Moroccans reported they would (or would not) engage in. (2) Moroccans made allowances with regard to the extent to which they expect Americans to conform to Moroccan cultural norms; however, they also wished that Americans learn about these cultural norms and refer to this knowledge in their interactions as part of their developing intercultural competence. (3) Learners when interviewed indicated a potential readiness to conform so as not to arouse offense but in their survey responses indicated that they would ultimately not be likely to do so. Instead, they preferred cultural behaviors that they found comfortable regardless of their compliance with Moroccan cultural norms.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/likely-comfortable-appropriate-behaviors-arab/docview/1902252249/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Muhammad, Ananda Astrini",2017,Creation and Evaluation of Multimedia Materials to Promote Development of Current and Prospective International Students' Pragmatic Competence in Academic Settings,"Literature on communicative language ability has identified pragmatic competence as a crucial aspect of second language (L2) communicative language ability. However, current literature has employed varied definitions of pragmatic competence, and little effort has been made to synthesize pragmatics studies in order to come up with a comprehensive list of components that comprise pragmatic competence. This effort was recently undertaken by Laughlin, Wain, and Schmidgall (2015), who conducted a systematic literature review of many different models, principles, and theories of pragmatics. The result was a construct of pragmatic competence which included five components, namely sociocultural knowledge, pragmatic-functional knowledge, grammatical knowledge, discourse knowledge, and strategic knowledge. In addition to proposing a more comprehensive construct of pragmatic competence, Laughlin et al. (2015) also suggested an operationalization of the construct through the use of multimedia materials. The present study aims to operationalize this construct by designing, producing, and evaluating multimedia materials to teach pragmatics, particularly making requests in spoken and written communication within U.S. academic settings. More specifically, this research work investigates: (1) how participants perceive the effectiveness of the multimedia materials and accompanying tasks for developing their pragmatic competence; and (2) how participants’ performance differs between pre-instruction and post-instruction assessments. The creation of the multimedia materials was guided by multimedia design principles proposed by Mayer (2009) and Chapelle’s (2001) Computer Assisted Language Learning task appropriateness framework. Two groups of participants, namely current U.S. international students and prospective international students, participated in the study. Both groups used and evaluated the multimedia materials hosted on an online learning platform. Data were collected from participants’ responses to feedback questionnaires, and their self-evaluation and self-reflection reports as well as their performance on pre-instruction and post-instruction assessments. Findings suggest that overall, participants’ learning experience was positive: they perceived gains specifically in their sociocultural, pragmatic-functional, and grammatical knowledge. However, certain limitations to the multimedia materials were also commented on by the participants, including the audio quality and length of the videos. Additionally, a comparison of participants’ performance in the pre-instruction and post-instruction assessments in Unit 1 seemed to suggest that most of the participants were able to successfully use the knowledge of request strategies and politeness features that they obtained from the instructional materials. This is indicated by their shift from using speaker-oriented strategies that are more direct in the pre-instruction assessment to using hearer-oriented strategies that are more indirect in the post-instruction assessments. Additionally, participants’ use of request strategies and politeness features were more varied after instruction. Results of this study provide insight on multimedia materials design that promotes an effective learning environment, especially for acquisition of pragmatic competence.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/creation-evaluation-multimedia-materials-promote/docview/1918119771/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Barkan, Maayan",2018,"The Pragmatic Strategy of Main-Clause Omission in Japanese: Its Contrast with Hebrew, and Its Learnability","Typically, linguists study things that people actually say, but this dissertation focuses on what people do NOT say; specifically, it deals with main-clause omission. This paper presents an empirical study on main-clause omission constraints in Japanese after the concessive particle ga (‘although’/’but’), the first known controlled experiment of its kind in the literature. It investigates, from a pragmatic and discourse-analytic perspective, intuitive judgments regarding the allowance of main-clause omission in Japanese, in an attempt to reveal whether Japanese Native Speakers (JNS) use main-clause omission as a pragmatic strategy, as is suggested in the literature. If they do, then what triggers main-clause omission in Japanese and whether this pragmatic strategy is rule-governed and systematic are further areas of interest and investigation. Moreover, this study presents a comparative analysis regarding the behavior around main-clause omission in natural conversation in both Japanese and in a language that is rarely directly compared to it in the literature: Hebrew. The reason for this comparison is that these two languages contrast pragmatically: Japanese is considered to be one of the most “high-context” languages in the world—i.e., a language where a lot of the information is internalized in the speaker, and very little is said explicitly, meaning a language that encourages omission in general; Hebrew, on the other hand, is considered to be one of the most “low-context” languages in the world—i.e., a language in which most of the information is expressed explicitly, and omission is discouraged (Hall, 1976, p.79, 98). Lastly, predicting a difference in behavior around main-clause omission between the two languages, this study looks at Hebrew native speakers who are learners of Japanese, in an attempt to reveal whether the Japanese native speakers’ behavior around main-clause omission is learnable or not by Hebrew native speakers (HNS). Results from experiments conducted on 40 participants—20 native speakers from each linguistic group—show that main-clause omission is not acceptable among Hebrew native speakers (HNS), but is widely acceptable, in certain contexts, among Japanese native speakers (JNS). Results also reveal that JNS use the omission as a pragmatic strategy, not randomly but systematically, and that the speech act of Mitigation in the subordinate clause is a crucial trigger for main-clause omission. Further, they reveal a sharp disparity in the cultural interpretation of main-clause omission: JNS view it as a strategy to show respect and politeness toward the listener, while HNS view it as an expression of disrespect. A follow-up experiment on 20 HNS who are advanced Japanese language learners (JLL) reveals that despite cultural and discourse pragmatic differences, the widely employed strategy of main-clause omission among JNS is learnable among non-native Japanese speakers. The study concludes that incorporating discourse pragmatic strategies of this kind into language textbooks and curricula, especially for speakers with different communication tactics, such as JNS and HNS, would contribute to higher proficiency of the target language and its cultural norms. Ultimately, the results strengthen the claim that discourse pragmatics are rule-governed, have systematic constraints, and are learnable.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/pragmatic-strategy-main-clause-omission-japanese/docview/2042959057/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Maruyama, Rie",2018,L2 Japanese Learners' Development of Conversational Involvement During Study Abroad: An Analysis of Overlap in Talk-In-Interaction,"This dissertation examines the changes in the occurrence of overlap in L2 Japanese learners’ conversation from the perspective of the development of interactional competence during study abroad. Previous studies have suggested that overlap of utterances in talk-in-interaction can function positively to show involvement, understanding, and cooperation and to move a conversation forward (e.g. Tannen, 1985; Maynard, 1989; Fujii &amp; Otsuka, 1994). Given that overlap can positively contribute to the joint construction of the conversation, overlap can be considered as one of the interactional resources that participants in conversation use for effective interaction (Young, 2008). A few studies have examined L2 Japanese learners’ overlapped utterances in conversation, but the number is limited. A longitudinal study in the context of spontaneous casual conversation will lead to a further understanding of the use of overlap by L2 Japanese learners. I collected recordings of dyadic casual conversations and of pre- and post-interviews from five L2 Japanese learners who participated in one-year study abroad programs in Japan. Each student recorded three to four conversations with their native Japanese friends or host families over the course of study abroad. The interviews were conducted before and after study abroad with the investigator. Their conversations and interviews were transcribed and all instances of overlaps were extracted and analyzed. The results showed changes in both frequency and contexts in which L2 learners’ overlap was observed. All L2 learners showed an increase in the occurrence of overlap in their conversations and expanded their use of different functions of overlap in the conversation over time. Although the L2 learners developed at a different rate, they appeared to have followed a similar developmental sequence. The results suggested the influence of two main factors, linguistic ability and the degree of involvement in the conversation, on the types of overlap found in their conversation. The findings suggested some trends in the developmental sequence of L2 learners’ overlap in conversation.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-japanese-learners-development-conversational/docview/2040121243/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Akiyama, Yuka",2018,Reciprocity in Online Social Interactions: Three Longitudinal Case Studies of a Video-Mediated Japanese-English e-Tandem Exchange,"Reciprocity is a key principle of eTandem, a telecollaborative arrangement where learners of different native languages meet online and use one language during half of the session and then do the same for the other language. While it has been argued that successful implementation of eTandem relies on this principle, the construct of reciprocity has not been operationalized beyond the traditional sense of ""equal time, effort, and interest"" (Brammerts, 1996). Thus, this study attempts to fill this gap by uncovering (1) what is reciprocity, and how it is enacted and accomplished, (2) what factors may mediate the enactment of reciprocity, and (3) what aspects of reciprocity seem more amenable to change than others. The context of this study was a semester-long, video-mediated eTandem project between U.S. learners of Japanese and Japanese learners of English who engaged in weekly interactions via Google Hangouts . After operationalizing reciprocity from second language acquisition (SLA), interactional sociolinguistics, and multimodal discourse analysis perspectives, I took a case study approach to examining the social interaction of three focal dyads who exhibited contrasting behaviors and perceptions about the project. The analysis showed that the participants enacted reciprocity beyond its traditional sense using both linguistic and non-linguistic resources. Specifically, the most successful dyad’s interaction was characterized by a collaborative interactional pattern, maximization of technological affordances, and various forms of situated reciprocity. Meanwhile, the least successful dyad’s interaction was characterized by a disproportionate conversational contribution by the U.S. participant and silences by the Japanese participant, mainly due to incompatible conversational styles (Tannen, 2005). Finally, the third dyad, who initially overemphasized the language-learning aspect of eTandem and struggled to establish comity (Aston, 1993), became one of the most successful and invested (Norton Peirce, 1995) dyads after resolving a ""critical incident"" that occurred when the U.S. participant came out as lesbian and both participants realized the importance of achieving intercultural understanding and fully exploiting each other’s bilingual resources. Based on these findings, I discuss what each form of reciprocity can reveal about participants’ social interaction and propose a new model for analyzing social interactions that take place in eTandem.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/reciprocity-online-social-interactions-three/docview/2030074138/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Daşkın, Nilüfer Can",2017,A Conversation Analytic Study of Reference to a Past Learning Event in L2 Classroom Interaction: Implications for Informal Formative Assessment,"This study sets out to investigate an unexplored phenomenon named “Reference to a Past Learning Event” (RPLE) in different L2 classroom contexts from the perspective of Conversation Analysis (CA) and CA-SLA. In doing so, it involves the analysis of a data-set that comes from a corpus of video-recordings of an EFL class (55 classroom hours) in a preparatory school at a state university in Turkey. Using CA, it investigated how teachers and students make RPLE by contingently diverging from the main activity to what was presented in past learning events in and through interaction. The micro-analysis generated models for the different sequential positioning of RPLE in teacher follow-up, response and initiation turns and in student turns. Regardless of the sequential position, RPLE confirms what is shared and establishes common ground, continuity and temporality in an instructional setting. However, it is also found that the motivation for employing RPLE varies with different sequential positions and L2 classroom contexts. Besides, the analysis demonstrated that RPLE creates learning opportunities and results in socially displayed and situated recollection of what was studied earlier not only within single learning events but also across subsequent learning events. As supplementary to the analysis of the interactional data, introspective data was gathered from stimulated recall sessions with the teachers and its analysis confirmed the conversation analytic findings but also generated additional findings. Lastly, the findings have implications for informal Formative Assessment, the description of L2 Classroom Interactional Competence and L2 teacher education.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/conversation-analytic-study-reference-past/docview/3122721630/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Han, Chan Yee",2017,The Use of Anime as a Teaching Tool in a Japanese as a Foreign Language Classroom,"Nowadays, with the rapid growth and availability of technology, traditional teaching approaches are often complemented by new innovations such as computer and audiovisual equipment as additional teaching aids along with the textbooks to teach language. Although the use of audiovisual materials, such as movies, dramas, news, and cartoon in language teaching has become a common approach for the language educators, many of them might not be well aware of the option of using anime in the context of teaching Japanese as a Foreign Language (JFL). There has been very little research reported on the practical use of anime in a JFL classroom. The present study was aimed to fill this gap by introducing the use of anime as a teaching tool in a JFL classroom and to understand the JFL students’ experiences of learning the Japanese language and culture through anime in the classroom context. To this end, eleven participants selected from a pilot study were invited to attend a course named “Learning Japanese Language and Culture through Anime” in a local public university. The present study employed the phenomenological research design by collecting qualitative data via participants’ analysis worksheets, learning diaries, and group interview. The findings showed that a JFL classroom could be dynamic and effective with the use of anime as a language and culture teaching tool. Through several classroom activities such as active viewing, reproduction, repetition, freeze framing, and follow-up discussion, productive lessons could be conducted. The analysis of anime dialogues played a very important part in raising the learners’ awareness about language features in anime such as different levels of politeness, casual forms, sentence-final particles, pronouns, honorific suffixes, and proverbs. Apart from effective language and culture learning, the use of anime in the JFL classroom was found to be able to create a motivating learning environment, provide a unique way of learning, strengthen classroom engagement, promote the learners’ critical thinking skill, and stimulate the learners’ extra effort to learn about the Japanese language and culture. On the other hand, the problems of using anime as a teaching tool such as biases towards anime and stereotypes were identified. For successful communication, the learners should have clear understanding not only of the lexicon, grammar, and culture patterns, but also the pragmatic background of the situation. In other words, the learners need to understand how context contributes to meaning in order for them to construct meaningful and effective communication in the foreign language that they are learning. In the case of teaching and learning JFL, the present study has shown that anime could be useful to help the language educators and language learners to achieve these language teaching and learning goals.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/use-anime-as-teaching-tool-japanese-foreign/docview/2877962967/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Do, Juhyun",2017,EFL Teaching on the Ground: A Case Study of Primary EFL Classroom in Korea,"This study explores how 5th grade EFL learners learn and use English in the primary EFL classroom in the complex sociocultural context of Korea. By exploring students' language learning and practices in their school setting triangulated with interviews about their out-of-school language as well as parents' perspective on English, the study highlights the interplay of in- and out-of-school language learning in EFL settings. This qualitative study consisted of semester-long persistent classrooms conducted along with audio-recordings of class sessions and interviews designed to target the complex realities of English education in this setting. Classroom observation focused on moment-to-moment teacher-student and student-student interactions as well as on the nature of language use by teachers and students, including the distribution of roles, rights, and duties closely examined using discourse analysis and triangulated with interviews. In addition, the macro-level values and beliefs prevalent in Korean English education were also examined. In this classroom, a Korean co-teacher (KT) and a native English-speaking co-teacher (NT) try to overcome their students' lack of exposure to the target language by providing meaningful contexts so that the students can learn and practice useful expressions with a variety of materials and modes of teaching and learning. The teachers' educational beliefs and interests thus influenced and constructed the students' language learning environment in the EFL classroom. For one semester, the students were socialized into new frames of teacher-controlled classroom routines through modelling, repetition, visual aids, and praise. In addition, this study reveals how the macro-level values and beliefs of Korean English education influences one local EFL classroom. The practice of teaching and learning in this local context has thus ecologically influenced by official themes promoted in the upper reaches of the national educational system. The findings confirm that the expectations of parents regarding the global and local value of English as an international language shapes the language learning opportunities of the focal students. All three focal participants started to learn English prior to the start of official language learning in school settings. Their parents believed that English is one of the most important subjects in their children's school life. The three focal students likewise believed that English is a basic tool for living as a global citizen in the future. The three focal student participants stated that their ultimate goals in learning English was to acquire comprehensive communicative language proficiency, not to be native-like speakers of English, which was coherent with their parents' view of language. Although the parents of all three focal participants were very supportive, parental investment did not seem to result in the same level of language proficiency. However, differences in language practice at home and especially some parents' direct involvement in their children's reading generated different language proficiency levels among the three focal students. The resulting gap between advanced and beginner learners thus generated asymmetric power relation among the students.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/efl-teaching-on-ground-case-study-primary/docview/2669445848/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Armağan, Kıymet Selin",2017,Effects of Timed Reading on Efl Learners' Reading Speed and Comprehension Level,"Reading has always been one of the most substantial topics in learning and teaching languages, as it is crucial to improve reading to become proficient in a language. A great number of studies have been carried out to clarify subskills and processes that are involved in reading process; several theories about improving reading skills have been put forward. Reading fluency has been discussed in detail and claimed to be crucial to become proficient readers. The highlight on reading fluency in native language (L1) has born questions about reading in a foreign language (FL). However, despite abundance of studies related to L1 reading, there is an obvious scarcity of studies on FL reading fluency mostly because of the complexity of reading process itself. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of timed reading practices on reading speed and reading comprehension levels of Turkish learners of English as a foreign language. 74 students participated in the study. However, 10 participants were detected as outliers via preliminary analysis, so they were left out from the analyses. The participants were divided into two groups as experimental and control groups. The experimental group received timed reading intervention for five weeks. A pre-test was applied a week before the learners started timed reading intervention and a post-test was applied one week after timed reading intervention period. The results revealed that timed reading intervention benefitted learners in terms of reading speed and reading comprehension significantly. Several implications for teaching reading in a foreign language were deduced depending on the findings of the research and the literature.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-timed-reading-on-efl-learners-speed/docview/2587649949/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Taylor, Laura Ann",2017,Contradictions and Possibilities: Examining the Complexities of Conferring across Three Elementary Literacy Classrooms,"This study explores the enactment of literacy conferences in reading and writing workshop across three classrooms at the same elementary campus, considering how these interactions between teacher and student served as spaces for humanizing literacy practice. To extend existing research on the discursive patterns and roles within literacy conferences, I examined reading and writing conferences from a critical perspective, drawing on theories of humanizing pedagogy and third space to study the circulation of power in these events. The study was guided by two research questions: (1) How do teachers and students co-construct critical humanizing pedagogy within reading and writing conferences?; and (2) How do teachers and students negotiate contradictions that arise in this work? The study is framed as a multiple case study of literacy conferences in three elementary classrooms within one urban elementary school. Using an ethnographic approach to data collection, I observed literacy instruction in first-, second-, and fourth-grade classrooms for five months. Data sources included: video- and audio-recording and field notes of reading and writing conferences; audio-recording and field notes of other components of literacy instruction; multiple teacher interviews; and artifacts of literacy instruction. Two focal teacher-student dyads were selected in each classroom, and eight conferences between each of these dyads were chosen for further analysis (resulting in a total of forty-eight focal conferences). I used a microethnographic approach to discourse analysis to analyze each focal conference, examining how literacy knowledges, practices, and identities were constructed in these interactions through the verbal and nonverbal actions of teacher and student. In the findings, I first detail how humanizing pedagogical discourses expressed by teachers in interviews were enacted in literacy conferences, including how these discourses at times contradicted and conflicted other discourses circulating in the classroom. Then, I consider how teachers strategically used these contradictions to construct moments of third space with students during conferences that produced new understandings of literacy. This analysis suggests that the enactment of humanizing pedagogy within literacy conferences is a necessarily complex social practice, but also one that allows for emancipatory knowledge and identity construction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/contradictions-possibilities-examining/docview/2156314874/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ro, Eunseok",2017,Interaction and Learning in an Extensive Reading Book Club,"As a pedagogical approach to second language (L2) learning, Extensive Reading (ER) has been practiced in various contexts of foreign and second language learning. Evidence for the benefits of ER has accumulated in an extensive body of research (Jeon &amp; Day, 2016; Nakanishi, 2015 for reviews) that documents the effects of individual reading on various L2 learning outcomes. Although ER is often implemented through pedagogical activities that associate individual reading with talk (e.g., S-K. Jung, 2017; Shelton-Strong, 2012; Song &amp; Sardegna, 2014; Suk, 2016), there is a lack of empirical studies that examine how ER activities evolve as social interaction and whether and how students benefit from participating in them. To fill this gap, this dissertation examines students’ long-term development of literacy practices in a book club designed in accordance with ER principles (Day &amp; Bamford, 1998, 2002; Green, 2005). Using multimodal conversation analysis, the study addresses three main topics. (1) It explicates the interactional organization of the book club and the multimodal practices through which the participants accomplish the institutional agenda. (2) It tracks how the students become interactionally competent participants over the course of two terms (18 weeks). Specifically, it describes how the students improve the recipient design of their contributions when they talk about a book to the group and more effectively align themselves as recipients. (3) The dissertation reveals how the facilitator’s instructions work as a catalyst for transforming the students’ participation practices and evolve the institutional norms. The findings suggest directions for providing ER with an interactional footing and for conducting ER book clubs specifically.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interaction-learning-extensive-reading-book-club/docview/2030531837/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kunisawa, Tae",2017,Thinking-for-Speaking and the EFL Mind: Face-to-Face Dialogue to Talk about Vertical Space,"Studies of thinking-for-speaking (Slobin, 1987) and of linguistic relativity (Gumperz &amp; Levinson, 1996) in multilinguals have been attracting more attention (Ortega, 2015). I propose the incorporation of sociocultural theory and linguistic relativity as a novel research approach in second language acquisition (SLA). Japanese learners of English go through a process in which word meaning develops from a single to binary semantic categorization as they learn to express vertical spatial operations in their second language (L2). Japanese has a nonobligatory distinction between contact and noncontact relationships when expressing vertical space (single semantic categorization), whereas English has an obligatory contrast (binary semantic categorization) (Munnich et al., 2001). The expression of vertical spatial relationships in Japanese and English is further influenced by language typology. Japanese, an SOV language, uses postpositions while English, an SVO language, uses prepositions. Vygotsky (1987) argues that verbal thinking (the internalization of speech) is tied with word meaning, and thus, as Japanese EFL high school students learn to express the obligatory contact-noncontact feature of vertical spatial configurations in English, moving from a single to a binary semantic categorization, verbal thinking will also develop. Vygotsky (1987) further claims that verbal thinking has sociocultural origins. In this dissertation, I investigate whether gesture can be instrumental in overcoming the constraints imposed by linguistic relativity. Vygotsky (1998) states, “Speech becomes the means for thinking mainly because it reflects an objectively occurring intellectual operation. This is a moment of major importance in the development of speech and thinking, which discloses the secret of the development of verbal thinking as a whole” (p. 114). I predict that a distinct worldview and the “development of cognitive processes” (Matyushkin, 1997b, p. 272) arise together when Japanese EFL students learn vertical spatial structure with the Gesture Listening Higher Concept Approach, which leads to “a qualitatively new mental formation that develops according to completely special laws and is subject to completely different patterns” (Vygotsky 1998, p. 34). The purpose of this study: (1) To pursue the new research path regarding incorporating linguistic relativity into SLA in sociocultural theory; (2) to explore whether the concurrent use of iconic co-speech co-thought gesture (ICSCTG) and listening practice can help Japanese high school students learn to express vertical spatial relationships in English more than they would learn from either treatment alone; (3) to investigate whether teaching ICSCTG and listening practice together will help Japanese EFL learners preserve knowledge of how to express vertical spatial relationships in English for a month after the intervention. I employed quantitative methods to accomplish the goals noted above. Results in this study suggest that the Gesture Listening Higher Concept Approach is an effective, evidence-based theoretical and pedagogical framework, which can facilitate L2 learning and conceptual change at the high school level. The effect of the Gesture Listening Higher Concept Approach on long-term foreign language learning would be a valuable avenue for future research. Slobin, D. I. (1987). Thinking for Speaking.

"Hsu, Hui-Ching Kayla",2017,Cultivating Asian Students' Willingness to Communicate in American Classrooms Using an Online Video-Based Pre-Arrival Course,"The purpose of this mixed methods study was: 1) to document the design and implementation process of an online video-based pre-arrival course that was intended to cultivate Asian students’ willingness to communicate in American Classrooms; 2) to assess the effectiveness of the course by measuring students’ oral proficiency and willingness to communicate; and 3) to investigate their first-year classroom participation as well as their experiences with the pre-arrival course. This research inquiry was guided by two research questions: 1) How does completing an online pre-arrival course influence Asian students’ speaking abilities, willingness to communicate, and verbal participation in their first-year engineering classrooms? 2) What are the course takers’ experiences in the online American Classroom Readiness (ACR) course? Using a convergent parallel design, this study collected quantitative and qualitative data to address the research questions. The quantitative data, including scores on a willingness to communicate survey and oral proficiency analysis, measured the effectiveness of the ACR course. The qualitative interview data captured students’ experiences with the online course as well as their first-year engineering classes. Nine students completed the online pre-arrival course, and five of them participated in the follow-up interview and survey. A control group of students who did not take the online course was deployed to provide a data source for comparative analysis. The analysis of the video recordings from Week 2 and Week 6 indicated that students’ oral proficiency in English had slightly increased. However, their willingness to communicate (WTC) survey scores, compared to those of non-course takers, did not show a significant difference. When it comes to the students’ verbal participation in their first-year engineering classrooms, students who took the ACR course used strategies covered the course to communicate. The qualitative data illustrated students’ experiences with the online pre-arrival course. Using a video-based platform, students were able to connect with one another via a highly-perceived social presence. The students’ perceptions of the course format were mixed. Some students were more comfortable with the video recording, while others were nervous about being in front of the camera. Participants who reported being comfortable with the video recording scored higher on the WTC survey that was based on the face-to-face classroom, compared to the rest of the course taker group. For those participants who reported being nervous about the video recording, the effects of the ACR course were not unclear. Although not all the data indicated that this innovative undertaking was a completely successful, this study provided merits in its relevant theories and applications, including promoters of willingness to communicate and the refinement of video-based online courses. Based on the analysis, related implications and recommendations for future study were also included.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/cultivating-asian-students-willingness/docview/2016198641/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Miyao, Mari",2017,"The processing of referential expressions in discourse by Chinese, English, and Japanese native speakers and by Chinese and Japanese learners of English","Referential expressions (REs), such as proper names and pronouns, pose challenges to second language learners (L2ers). Generally, adult native speakers prefer a more explicit RE form (e.g., a proper name) when referring to a less salient/accessible entity in the discourse and a reduced RE form (e.g., a pronoun) for a salient/accessible entity (e.g., Ariel, 1990). To use REs successfully, L2ers need to calculate the accessibility of discourse entities and associate them with particular RE forms. The present study asks how adult L2ers whose first language (L1) is Chinese or Japanese (null-subject languages) comprehend and produce REs in discourses in English (a non-null-subject language). Experiment 1 looks at the comprehension of REs in subject position (subject-REs), using closely-translated versions of a sentence-by-sentence self-paced reading task adapted from Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom (1993), by native speakers of English, Chinese, and Japanese. Experiment 2 examines the same participants’ production of subject-REs via a three-panel picture-narration task adapted from Arnold and Griffin (2007). Experiments 3 and 4 employ the English version of the two tasks to explore the comprehension and production of subject-REs by intermediate-to-advanced L1-Chinese and L1-Japanese L2ers of English. In the reading task, native English and native Japanese speakers preferred the most reduced subject-REs in their native language––respectively, overt-pronoun subjects and null-pronoun subjects––for accessible entities; native Japanese speakers strongly dispreferred overt-pronoun subjects. Different reading-time (i.e., raw vs. residual) analyses indicated different subject-RE preferences for native Chinese speakers, but they never dispreferred overt-pronoun subjects. In the production task, all three language groups preferred pronominal subject-REs for accessible entities, but when accessibility was reduced by the presence of another entity in the discourse, by gender congruence, or by a shifted discourse focus, they produced (more explicit) repeated-name subject-REs more frequently. Neither L2 group showed subject-RE preferences in reading, but in production, where pictures helped build firm discourse representations, they clearly preferred pronominal subjects for accessible entities and repeated-name subjects for less accessible entities. Overall, the present study suggests that when sufficient contextual support is provided, L2ers can calculate discourse accessibility and choose subject-RE forms according to the accessibility level (contra Sorace, 2011).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-referential-expressions-discourse/docview/2014467662/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Acosta, Diana M. Fernandez",2020,The Syntax-Pragmatics Interface: Intransitivity and Word Order in L3 Spanish,"Until fairly recently, most researchers assumed that the acquisition of a second language (L2) and of a third (or subsequent) (L3/Ln) language were indistinguishable. This is not the case, as knowledge of two or more previous languages adds complexity to non-native acquisition. This study addresses the issue of crosslinguistic influence between three languages in view of two theories: (a) the L2 will always be the cause of crosslinguistic influence in an L3 (Bardel&amp;Falk, 2012); (b) the determining factor for transfer is typological similarity between the languages in question (Rothman, 2010). This study focuses on the L3 acquisition of Spanish by speakers whose L1 is Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and L2 is English. A comparison group consisted of learners of L2 Spanish whose L1 is BP. In particular, I examined the acquisition of the choice of word order in Spanish, subject-verb or verb-subject, which depends on two factors: the type of verb (morphosyntax), and the information structure of the sentence (pragmatics), whether focused or unfocused. The problem for learners consists of processing the interface of two linguistic modules: morphosyntax and pragmatics. Interfaces have been found to be difficult in acquisition (Sorace, 2011), adding an additional wrinkle to the problem faced by learners. The three languages chosen differ in relation to word order: Portuguese distinguishes between verb types, but pragmatics is not a factor; English exhibits fixed subject-verb order; and Spanish takes both verb class and pragmatics into consideration. Because of this, we are able to distinguish between possible influence from English, which predicts rejection of verb-subject order in all circumstances, and typology, which predicts learners using verb class to distinguish word order but not pragmatics. Participants completed a preference task (Lozano, 2006), a production task, a vocabulary quiz, and a linguistic profile questionnaire. Findings support the hypothesis that typology plays a role in L3 transfer, as learners are able to adjust their interlanguage to accept the inverted order in instances where the L2 is inflexible. However, both L2 and L3 learners also seem to integrate pragmatic constraints in their interlanguage showing that they are on their way to acquiring a Spanish native-like grammar.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/syntax-pragmatics-interface-intransitivity-word/docview/2714869691/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hoshi, Saori",2017,"'That movie was so hilarious <i>ne</i>!' the development of Japanese interactional particles <i>ne, yo,</i> and <i> yone</i> in L2 classroom instruction","The present study examines the development of L2 interactional competence (Hall, 1999; He &amp; Young, 1998) by JFL learners in an explicitly instructed setting as evidenced by their metapragmatic development and use of Japanese interactional particles ne, yo, and yone in unscripted conversations with NSs and peer learners. More specifically, the study aims to investigate the role of pragmatics-focused instruction in the learners’ ability to participate in a range of assessment activities (Goodwin &amp; Goodwin, 1992) using the particles ne, yo, and yone as resources to co-construct stance and achieve intersubjectivity (e.g., Du Bois &amp; Kärkkäinen, 2012; Kärkkäinen, 2006) between participants in an ongoing interaction. To bridge the gap between the paucity of instructional treatment and the highly frequent use of the interactional particles in mundane Japanese conversation, an instructional approach that incorporated awareness-raising and conversational activities was proposed and implemented in a third semester JFL course for one semester. In order to examine the effects of instruction on the development of interactional competence as evidenced by the learners’ use of particles ne, yo, and yone in the conversation sessions, the study focuses on the following perspectives: 1) learners’ metapragmatic understanding of the variability in particle function and in the meanings that the particles can index; 2) learners’ use of the particles in ways that are consistent with what they were taught, and that potentially extend beyond their instructed learning in terms of form, function, and activity-relevant participation; and 3) the learners’ demonstration of ability to deploy these particles as resources for joint stance taking in the conversations with NS partners and peer learners in linguistically and culturally appropriate ways. Findings from the experimental group learners’ performance from the pre- and post-tests provide evidence that they have demonstrated metalinguistic development of the discourse functions of the particles in the described discourse situations. The conversation data revealed that the learners’ development of interactional competence is evidenced by their increasing ability to attend to, and design their own talk in a way for it to be understood and responded to by the recipient (Pekarek Doehler &amp; Berger, 2016) through the use of the particles ne, yo, and yone for achieving joint construction of stance and intersubjectivity with their conversational partners. Moreover, the learners’ greater understanding and use of the particles through the instruction facilitate the emergence of learners’ agency, which provides the learners with an increased capacity to actively pick up linguistic affordances to develop their personal voice (Liddicoat &amp; Scarino, 2013) to interact more creatively and meaningfully with their conversational partners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/that-movie-was-so-hilarious-i-ne-development/docview/2014436157/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Forsythe, Edward M., III",2017,A Qualitative Case Study of Japanese University Students and Personal Smartphone Use in English as a Foreign Language Classes,"Japanese university English instructors are increasingly requiring students to use their personal smartphones for activities in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom activities. Because of this, it has been recommended that studies be conducted to ascertain Japanese university students' perceptions of using smartphones in EFL language learning. The problem that this study addressed is that several studies have demonstrated Japanese university EFL teachers require students to use their smartphones to perform language learning activities, but little is known about student perceptions of using their own smartphones for EFL activities. The purpose of this qualitative, single case study was to explore Japanese university students' perceptions of required use of personal smartphones in EFL classes. Purposeful sampling was used to gather a sample of nine students from a sampling frame from one university EFL class at one public university in northern Japan. Data collection employed in-depth interviews to gather college student experiences with being required to use their personal smartphones in the EFL course. Secondary data was gathered by collecting nonverbal cues observed during the interviews to confirm the students’ feelings as expressed in their verbal interview responses. This study was grounded in a thorough review of the literature that identified a need for further exploration of Japanese university student perceptions of using their personal smartphones in their EFL classes. The results of this study showed that Japanese university students have had little experience with using their smartphones for language learning activities, but that they enjoy and prefer that their professors require them to use their smartphones in EFL class activities. They feel that EFL classes which take advantage of student smartphones are more interesting and more productive because of the affordance of individualization of instruction. This study provides Japanese universities’ EFL educators insight into student perceptions of current educational trends, and the results provide insight into how those trends may affect students’ motivation. However, because this study was limited in size, replication studies should be conducted to thoroughly understand student and teacher preferences in using smartphones in EFL learning and to make EFL education in Japanese universities as efficient and effective as possible.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/qualitative-case-study-japanese-university/docview/2006913606/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Baxter, Robert Patrick",2017,Co-constructing turns as interactional competence: Collaborative turn sequences in L1 and L2 Spanish,"Interactional competence is a theoretical construct that has only recently been tested empirically. Speakers contribute to an interaction with their individual resources; however, interactional competence is co-constructed by all participants. Interactional competence can be observed in spoken interaction as speakers’ combined ability to recognize and respond to expectations within a context (Young 2008, 2011). Collaborative turn sequences occur when an interlocutor who does not hold the floor pre-emptively contributes to an ongoing turn, eliciting an act of acknowledgement. Collaborative turn sequences have thus far been primarily examined in English, whereas use in first and second-language (L1 and L2) Spanish are relatively unexplored. This study thus characterizes and compares collaborative turn sequences in L1 and L2 Spanish. Sixteen native speakers of Spanish and 22 fourth-year learners completed Spanish and English conversation tasks, an experimental production task, and a judgment task. In Spanish conversation, NS-NS pairs employed prosodic, syntactic, and discursive cues for pre-emptive entry, continued the structure of ongoing turns, and acknowledged contributions with repetition. Learner-learner pairs displayed high and low-production patterns that differed in cues for pre-emptive entry and contiguity with the ongoing turn. High-production learners displayed a targetlike use of prosodic and syntactic cues (especially intonation), whereas whereas low-production learners hesitated with pauses, fillers, and restarts to such a degree that prosodic and syntactic cues lost their strategic value. High-production learners continued the structure of ongoing turns more often than low-production learners, and L2 acknowledgment overall favored affirmation over repetition. In experimentally-controlled attempts to collaborate with recordings, NS responses approximated response strategies observed in conversational data, whereas L2 responses demonstrated that all learners were at least capable of producing pre-emptive contributions. Experimental responses accentuated the nontargetlike nature of L2 pre-emptive entry, since learners often said “too much, too late” compared to native speakers. In the judgment task, native speakers considered authentic recordings of collaborative turn sequences to be appropriate, whereas learners from high and low-production groups judged sequences as both appropriate and inappropriate. Learners noticed collaborative and competitive aspects of collaborative turn sequences, and some learners even regarded “interruptions” (i.e. conversational overlap) in Spanish to be a normal practice.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/co-constructing-turns-as-interactional-competence/docview/1972137869/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Morris, Kimberly Jane",2017,Learning by Doing: The Affordances of Task-Based Pragmatics Instruction for Beginning L2 Spanish Learners Studying Abroad,"The study abroad (SA) context is often assumed to foster pragmatic development in a second language (L2), yet previous scholarship confirms that pragmatic norms are culturally-shaped and often remain imperceptible to uninstructed SA students (Bataller, 2010; Cohen &amp; Shively, 2007; Shively, 2010). Because pragmatics is not traditionally taught in language classrooms (Bardovi-Harlig, 2013), SA students are left to their own devices when interacting in the host community and performing face-threatening speech acts in their L2 such as requests and refusals, among others. Considering the importance of pragmatics for successful communication along with the predominance of short-term SA programs, it is crucial to support and accelerate students’ pragmatic development during immersion, especially beginners with limited linguistic and cultural knowledge. This study explores the affordances of explicitly teaching pragmatics to 12 students who studied beginning L2 Spanish in Spain for 10 weeks. A task-based instructional treatment (Long, 2015) was designed to raise students’ awareness of appropriate linguistic and cultural norms related to various speech acts, or meaningful “tasks” such as asking for directions and ordering a meal. Instruction was complemented with computer-mediated practice and weekly language exchanges with native speakers to further scaffold student learning. Following instruction, students carried out these tasks in the community and audio-recorded their interactions. To measure students’ development, data were collected through a pre/post Discourse Completion Test (DCT), pre-task audio-recordings conducted before instruction, naturalistic audio-recordings of task completion following instruction, self-reflections of task completion, interviews, and surveys. To corroborate the effectiveness of the instructional treatment, further pre/post DCT data were collected from two comparison groups of students studying beginning L2 Spanish, one abroad in Madrid and another at home in California. Analyses of the data confirmed the positive impact the instructional treatment had on students’ pragmatic development. The treatment group not only demonstrated statistically significant gains in pragmatic competence on the pre/post DCT measure, but they were also highly successful in applying their knowledge while completing the real-world tasks in the host community, as evidenced by comparisons of their pre-task and task completion recordings. Similarly, the students’ reflections of their own task completion showed increased awareness of the pragmatic features that were introduced in the instructional treatment, which likely explains why they demonstrated high retention of their pragmatic competence one full year after the program, as measured by a delayed post-DCT completed by eight of the 12 students. Moreover, the students who received the instructional treatment showed significantly higher gains in pragmatic competence when compared to the students in both comparison groups (abroad and at home) who did not receive the instruction. These results confirm the effectiveness of the task-based instructional model in accelerating beginning L2 students’ pragmatic competence while studying abroad. The findings from this study have the potential to not only inform the instructional design of study abroad programs, but also provide directors, teachers, and students with insights on how to maximize the study abroad experience. These findings could potentially change how and when pragmatics is taught both at home and abroad.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/learning-doing-affordances-task-based-pragmatics/docview/1970401508/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Van Booven, Christopher D.",2017,The Role of Context in the Development of Second Language Interactional Competence: A Comparative Microanalysis of Topic Initiation Practices in the Study Abroad Homestay and the Language Classroom,"This dissertation research aims to better specify the role of context in the development of second language interactional competence. Drawing on conversation-analytic methods and Wong and Waring’s (2010) model of interactional practices, I described and compared the opportunities that two study abroad contexts—the homestay and the language classroom—afforded one language learner to participate in one set of interactional practices—the initiation of new topic talk—throughout a semester-length study abroad program. Specifically, I sought to determine: (a) which methods the participants deployed to initiate new topic talk in each context; (b) which topic initiation methods were deployed exclusively by the learner, exclusively by the proficient speaker, or by both learner and proficient speaker in each context; and (c) how the participants sequentially organized each method of topic initiation in each context. The first set of analyses revealed that the participants made use of five distinct topic initiation methods and that all five methods appeared in both the homestay and the language classroom. The second set of analyses revealed that the affordances for participating as an initiator of new topic talk differed systematically by context, whereby the learner was observed to deploy a wider range of methods for initiating topic talk in the homestay as opposed to the language classroom. The third set of analyses revealed similarities and differences in the ways in which the participants organized topic initiation sequences across the two contexts. With respect to similarities, topic initiation methods appearing during casual pre-class talk interactional periods in the language classroom were often organized using the same basic sequences of turns that were observed in the homestay. Differences, meanwhile, included: (a) variations in sequential trajectories stemming from differences in participation frameworks (i.e., dyadic in the homestay vs. multiparty in the language classroom); (b) differences in the organization of methods between the homestay and pedagogically-oriented mid-class talk interactional periods; (c) differences in the range of topicalizable items; and (d) differences in the activities to which topic talk was directed. The observed differences in both the distributions and organization of topic initiation methods across the two contexts provide evidence that different learning contexts may afford learners differential opportunities for participating in second language interaction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-context-development-second-language/docview/1964286299/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kim, Sangki",2017,Stabilization of Idiosyncratic Fixed Expressions in the Wild,"Formulaic expressions (FEs) are considered integral to second-language (L2) competence, as they allow for: (1) socially shared resources to readily participate in everyday interaction; (2) a processing short-cut for fluent native-like performance; and (3) the seeds of L2 development. However, researchers using interlanguage (pragmatics) and dual-processing perspectives have argued that stabilized idiosyncratic FEs are evidence of rule-based productivity, thus challenging usage-based perspectives on FEs (Bardovi-Harlig &amp; Stringer, 2016; Wray, 2002). While a few studies have documented the stabilization of idiosyncratic FEs from usage-based perspectives (Eskildsen, 2012; Hauser, 2013c), there is still a paucity of research focusing on the use of idiosyncratic FEs in the L2 lifeworld, despite being recognized as characteristic of naturalistic adult SLA. Falling at the intersection of three research strands—the learning of formulaic language, stabilization of L2 competence, and L2 learning in the wild—this study aims to contribute to greater understanding of the stabilization of idiosyncratic FEs, using multimodal conversation analysis (Mortensen, 2012). Data for this study consist of 79 hours of video recordings capturing service encounters with customers over a 30-month period at a convenience store in Honolulu. The focal participant (Minji) is an adult Korean user of L2 English. Focusing on one type of routine sequences in payment activities, the analysis delineates Minji’s continuing use of idiosyncratic FEs in terms of their composition and sequential placements. The study examines how Minji and the customers co-construct the routine sequences with a focus on the customers’ epistemic status and their orientations to textual material in the setting. By accounting for the structure of understanding in the routine sequences, this study highlights the in-situ sense-making practices that Minji and the customers employ and their reflexive relationship with the stabilization of the idiosyncratic FEs. The analysis also focuses on repair activities arising in the informing sequences, looking at how the participants manage sources of trouble and their impact on L2 learning opportunities. The findings explain the stabilization of idiosyncratic FEs as embodied, sequential, and experiential phenomena occurring in an environment filled with meaningful materials and, further, are co-constructed in and through the participants’ interactional competence.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/stabilization-idiosyncratic-fixed-expressions/docview/1954090603/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zheltoukhova, Snezhana",2017,Tutoring in a Russian Flagship Program: Student and Tutor Perceptions and Their Organizational Representation,"In this dissertation, I examine foreign language teaching and learning in the context of the Russian Flagship Program, part of a federally funded nationwide initiative that helps undergraduate students of all majors achieve Superior-level proficiency on the ACTFL scale (ILR 3) in the target language. Conversation-based one-on-one and small-group tutoring is an indispensable part of the program. In this study, I aim to ascertain student and tutor perceptions of such tutoring and the ways in which reported beliefs are enacted in tutoring session interactions. For these purposes, I videotaped individual and small-group tutorials to analyze the major organizational features of student-tutor and peer-peer “conversations-for-learning” (Kasper, 2004). I subsequently conducted semi-structured interviews with the study participants, both students and tutors, in order to examine their views on their goals, factors for learning considered more or less helpful, as well as other salient aspects of tutoring. These interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded for recurrent themes through the lens of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, 1996). I used the sociocultural theory framework (Lantolf &amp; Thorne, 2006) to conceptualize the Russian Flagship conversation-based tutorials as collaborative conversations-for-learning, or meaningful dialogues, in which students and tutors participate for the purposes of mutual knowledge co-construction and language learning within the student zone of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1978). As a result, my research reveals major aspects of Russian Flagship Program tutoring from an emic (participant-relevant) perspective. I also demonstrate how participant beliefs emerge in tutorial interactions through the organizational properties of talk such as turn-taking, sequence structure, repair, and others. The findings of this analysis contribute to the overall understanding of interpersonal interactions within an institutional context and provide information on participants’ experiences of foreign language tutoring. Consequently, my study offers practical insights for improved facilitation of conversation-based learning practices for educators in any language program that uses tutoring as a part of its curriculum.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/tutoring-russian-flagship-program-student-tutor/docview/1953255763/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zamora, Celia Chomón",2017,The Secret is in the Processing: A Study of Levels of Explicit Computerized Feedback in Heritage and L2 Learners of Spanish,"The field of Instructed Second Language Acquisition (ISLA) has expressed interest in pursuing a research agenda that expands the current heritage language (HL) strand of research to investigate how this heterogeneous population re-learns their family language, and how this experience differs from that of second language (L2) learners. This dissertation examines an unexplored aspect of this strand - Depth of Processing (DOP) - and its potential role in the development of the Spanish pluperfect subjunctive in contrary to fact conditional sentences in the past, in both HL and L2 learner participant populations, and how it is facilitated by computerized feedback in more and less explicit conditions. The current study focused on four main issues: 1) it investigated how Spanish HL participants processed input in their heritage language, and how it was similar or different than L2 participants; 2) it examined how the Speaker profile and/or 3) Type of feedback (i.e. +Explicit feedback, -Explicit feedback, control) had an effect on subsequent performance on assessments; and 4) it addressed the potential correlation between levels of processing on performances following the experiment. Levels of processing were measured by means of think-aloud protocols collected during the experiment. Performance was examined by way of two written assessment tasks - a controlled production and a semi-spontaneous picture description task. Results showed that HL participants primarily employed non-metalinguistic strategies (e.g. grammatical judgment, prior knowledge) to process the input, whereas L2 participants relied more on metalinguistic strategies (e.g. mentions of previous lessons and explicit grammar). Additionally, although the HL participants significantly outperformed the L2 participants on both tasks at the immediate posttests, the significant difference was not maintained on the delayed posttest. Regarding the levels of explicitness of feedback, both the +EF and -EF groups significantly outperformed the control group on both tasks. At the same time, no significant difference was found between the +EF and –EF on both the immediate and delayed posttests. Finally, with respect to DOP, the +EF facilitated more instances of higher levels of processing than the –EF condition, and DOP was positively and significantly correlated with better performances at the delayed posttest.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/secret-is-processing-study-levels-explicit/docview/1949407696/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kawamoto, Shota",2017,The Effect of Written Corrective Feedback on Cohesion In Japanese as a Foreign Language Learners' Writing,"Cohesion in second/foreign language writing has been studied from a theoretical standpoint since the late 1970s; however, little research has been conducted to investigate how cohesion can be improved. There is research that indicates that teacher feedback contributes to the improvement of cohesion in EFL leaners’ writing (Lee, 2002; Tangkiengsirisin, 2010); however, there is little empirical research examining the effect of teacher feedback on cohesive devices in learners of Japanese as a foreign language (JFL)’s writing, which calls for further research to delve into this issue. The present study investigated whether or not written corrective feedback (WCF) increases the number of cohesive devices in lower-level JFL learners’ writing. The subjects received one of the following WCF: direct feedback that explicitly corrects errors, indirect feedback that provides the location of errors with underlines and error codes, or no feedback on cohesive devices. They wrote four short expository essays (250 to 300 letters) about a different topic and revised them as their homework. The long-term effect was investigated by comparing a pre-test writing and a post-test writing 2, which was assigned after the treatment. In addition, the pre-test writing and a post-test writing 1, which was assigned a month later, were compared to investigate whether there were short-term effects. Furthermore, the extent to which the number of each type of cohesive device (reference, substitution, ellipsis, or conjunction) increased was examined. The results indicated that WCF did not have a statistically significant effect on the use of cohesive devices for either the short-term effect or the long-term effect; nevertheless, significant increases for referential and conjunctive cohesive devices within groups were found. In addition, it was found that more than 90% of the subjects in the direct WCF group and more than 60% in the coded group succeeded in revising their first drafts based on WCF, indicating that WCF was effective for them into editing their errors on cohesive devices.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-written-corrective-feedback-on-cohesion/docview/1947709070/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hernández Morales, Ana Jessica",2017,Development in Pronunciation Accuracy Through Visual Feedback and Drills: Evidence From Stoprhotic Clusters in Learners of Spanish as L2,"Previous literature argues that native-like pronunciation is impossible in non-primary language acquisition related to the age of L2 onset (Scovel, 1988; Long, 1990). Studies provide evidence that different types of instruction have a positive effect on L2 learners’ productions (i.e., Derwing, Munro &amp; Wiebe, 1998; González-Bueno &amp; Quintana-Lara, 2011) and L2 learners may achieve native-like mastery of the target language phonetic features (Bongaerts, 1995). Some studies provide evidence that drills are effective for producing more native-like speech (Paulston, 1970; Yoshida &amp; Fukada, 2014). Other studies provide evidence that visualization of the speech contours has a significant effect on improving suprasegmentals (i.e., Chun, 1989; James, 1979) and segmentals (i.e., Motohashi-Saigo &amp; Hardison, 2009). For stop rhotic clusters (SRC), Spanish and English differ in: short vs. long lag stop voicing; rhotic manner (tap vs. retroflex), and epenthesis (presence vs. absence). Studies suggest that L2 learners may achieve native-like mastery of target language phonetic properties of SRC (Colantoni &amp; Steele, 2006) but no known studies have compared the use of a visual feedback paradigm (VFP), Drills, and traditional instruction in their production. Three groups of native English speaker learners of Spanish recorded a pre-test, 3 trainings and post-test throughout one semester. The visual feedback group and drills group performed a visual and auditory discrimination task respectively, comparing their productions with those of NSS. The control group performed cultural activities. Target tokens, containing SRCs, were embedded in novel phrases and carrier sentences. While both trainings were equally effective for the durational parameters of the plosive and the rhotic segment, the other two features (rhotic manner and epenthesis) showed more resistance to be mastered. Results show that the acquisition of SRC seems to follow a difficulty acquisition hierarchy, but there is a strong co-dependence between the rhotic manner and the presence of an epenthetic vowel.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-pronunciation-accuracy-through-visual/docview/1947708487/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Li, Noriyasu Harada",2017,Interpretation and Processing of the System of Japanese Reflexives,"Japanese reflexives have long been a focus in Japanese linguistics. Early work by Kuroda (1965), Kuno (1977), and recent work by Oshima (2002) and Nishigauchi (2014) drew attention to the number of syntactic, semantic, and discourse-related properties that are attributed to zibun and other Japanese reflexives (see Kuroda for c-command relations, Kuno for empathetic logophor, Oshima for de se interpretations, and Nishigauchi for point of view). Embedded in all the research is Chomsky’s (1981, 1986) seminal work on Government and Binding, in which Binding Principle A states that anaphors must have a co-indexed and c-commanding antecedent noun phrase within their governing category. Later, the principles of movement at LF (Cole, Hermon, &amp; Sung, 1990; Cole &amp; Sung, 1994) successfully captured the ability for monomorphemic reflexives to bind with an antecedent ‘outside’ of their governing clause, if that clause was based on the original analysis of English. However, questions still remain as to who the correct potential antecedent of the reflexive is, especially when there are multiple grammatically possible antecedents in Japanese. Related to this issue is the question of how second language (L2) learners acquire the abstract properties of Japanese reflexives. This dissertation investigates how native speakers (L1) of Japanese link reflexives to their antecedents through experimental research on specific sets of anaphoric pronouns – zibun, zibunzisin, kare-zisin, and kanozyo-zisin. The dissertation also examines how L2 learners acquire these properties in Japanese. Although it is well known that co-reference with these reflexives can be ambiguous (Aikawa, 2002), I analyze how L1 Japanese speakers successfully construct anaphoric relations among determiner phrases and resolve ambiguity through an analysis of case and the argument structure of the verb. The interaction between case and the predicate in reflexive-antecedent binding, to my knowledge, has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature to date, and this point is the innovative focus of my dissertation. Further, I expand the scope of reflexives to all reflexive forms in Japanese, and cross-linguistically analyze acquisition between typologically related (e.g., Korean) and unrelated (e.g., Chinese) languages.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interpretation-processing-system-japanese/docview/1945245682/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Fernández Arroyo, Laura",2017,L2 Spanish Verbal Morphology Mastery Sequence,"Although there is agreement on the existence of a sequence in the acquisition of a second language (L2), it is still controversial how such a sequence would proceed. Different theories for different languages have been proposed. A popular proposal is that first lexical and later morphological aspects are acquired, and within the later, first the regular ones, and then the irregular ones. In this study, departing from the proposals of Hopp’s, Skehan, Pienemann,and Connectionism, as well as some previous results by Presson et Al. (2013), some of their theories’ predictions with respect to the acquisition sequence of indicative preterit and present tenses in Spanish as L2 by native speakers of English were tested. In order to do so, 61 students of 3 different levels were given a test where they had to conjugate these two tenses for regular, irregular, and paronymous verbs. Response accuracy was measured for each of the 1,098 experimental items. In addition, for the second year level, students were divided into a training and a control group, and the effects of training were measured with a second test. The training method used was the Focus on Form type of instruction. Results indicate that, for accuracy, with respect to tenses, present is mastered before preterit is (present already in the first year, while preterit only gets mastered in the third year). Likewise, irregular verbs are harder to master, particularly in the preterit, although differences were not consistently significant through the advancement in level. Paronymous verbs did not show a different mastering timing than that of the regular verbs. As for the training, the results for the training group were not very significantly different from those of the control group, contrary to previous studies’ results, indicating that more training might be necessary, although the timing should still occur in the second year for the preterit. Thus, and although more studies are needed still in the area, it seems that there is a sequence in the acquisition of Spanish L2 morphology, so that present is mastered significantly earlier than preterit, and regular verbs are mastered also earlier than irregular ones, despite the higher frequency of irregular verbs.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-spanish-verbal-morphology-mastery-sequence/docview/1934125621/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ito, Kinji",2017,The Efficacy of Translation and Oral Corrective Feedback in Promoting Language Proficiency Development,"This paper examines the efficacy of translation and oral corrective feedback on intermediate Japanese language learning. The former consists of composition with regard to writing accuracy and fluency, as well as lexical acquisition. The main purpose of this dissertation is to find ways of helping learners acquire Japanese language skills most effectively. Specifically, translation assisted composition and vocabulary learning, and corrective feedback were selected as potentially powerful teaching tools for promoting language proficiency development. This study adopted the action research method and a total of 21 participants took my course Japanese Through Translation. Since, in today’s academic settings, language courses are designed to develop learners’ communicative competencies, translation has been overlooked. Based on my experience, however, I believed that translation is an efficient means of adopting a metalinguistic attitude toward language learning, and especially useful for learning semantic and lexical elements. Consequently, the effectiveness of translation was examined by comparing two writing modes (translated and direct) and two vocabulary learning procedures (deliberate and incidental). The results show that participants enhanced writing accuracy through translation, and retained more lexical items via incidental practices. They not only utilized learned skills and knowledge of writing, but of speaking as well. As instructor-researcher, I employed three different types of oral corrective feedback in order of implicitness—recast, elicitation, and metalinguistic—to investigate which worked best for second language (L2) learners. Each was provided in turn when they made errors in utterances during one-on-one conversations. In the end, the third mode outperformed the others by a large margin. The study also found that tasks/cues involving cognitive processes were more useful for storing information in and retrieving information from the memory system. This helps explain why translation is an effective means of learning a foreign language, and metalinguistic feedback is a powerful teaching tool that helps students improve their linguistic performance. Although the degree may vary, all three research categories are interconnected via human cognitive processes, which clearly play an important role in L2 learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/efficacy-translation-oral-corrective-feedback/docview/1933743019/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Sowers, Andrew Michael",2017,Loanwords in Context: Lexical Borrowing from English to Japanese and its Effects on Second-Language Vocabulary Acquisition,"Research has shown that cognates between Japanese and English have the potential to be a valuable learning tool (Daulton, 2008). Yet little is known on how Japanese learners of English produce cognates in context. Recently, studies have argued that cognates can cause a surprisingly high number of syntactic errors in sentence writing activities with Japanese learners (Rogers, Webb, &amp; Nakata, 2014; Masson, 2013). In the present study, I investigated how Japanese learners of English understood and used true cognates (words that have equivalent meanings in both languages) and non-true cognates (words where the Japanese meaning differs in various ways from their English source words). Via quasi-replication, I analyzed participants’ sentences to determine the interaction of true and non-true cognates on semantics and syntax. In an experimental study, twenty Japanese exchange students filled out a word knowledge scale of thirty target words (half true cognates and half non-true cognates) and wrote sentences for the words they indicated they knew. These sentences were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively for both semantic and syntactic errors. Sentences with true cognates were semantically accurate 86% of the time, while those with non-true cognates were accurate only 62.3% of the time, which was a statistically significant difference. When the sentences were analyzed for syntax, there was no statistically significant difference in the number of errors between true and non-true cognates, which contrasts with previous research. Qualitative analysis revealed that the most problematic syntactic issue across both cognate types was using collocations correctly. Among those collocational issues, there were clear differences in the types of errors between true and non-true cognates. True cognate target words were more likely to lead to problems with prepositional collocations, while non-true cognate target words were more likely to lead to problems with verb collocations. These results suggest that for intermediate Japanese learners of English, semantics of non-true cognates should be prioritized in learning, followed by syntax of true and non-true cognates, which should be taught according to the most problematic error types per cognate status.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/loanwords-context-lexical-borrowing-english/docview/2010531455/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Wen, Zhijun",2015,Chinese sentence processing by first and second language speakers,"This dissertation research investigates real-time second language (L2) sentence processing, with a focus on L2 Mandarin Chinese. It seeks to reveal how adult L2 learners (“L2ers”) exploit different sources of information (morphosyntactic, lexical-semantic, and discourse-context) and hence illuminates the issue of whether L2ers are capable of fully specified processing. The research employs two different processing tasks: comprehension-focused self-paced reading (CFSPR) and acceptability-judgment self-paced reading (AJSPR); there are four main studies: one in English comparing native English speakers with L1-Chinese L2ers of English, and three in Chinese comparing native Chinese speakers with learners of Chinese whose native language (L1) is English (or Japanese). The first study assesses whether AJSPR is more sensitive than CFSPR in detecting deep-level processing by examining L1 and L2 processing of English subject-verb number agreement in an AJSPR task in comparison to Wen’s (2007) study employing a CFSPR task. The second study compares L1 and L2 processing of (grammatical vs. ungrammatical) negation–aspect interactions in Chinese to test whether L2ers whose L1 lacks such morphosyntax can ultimately acquire it and use it in online sentence processing. The third study investigates use of lexical-semantic information in Chinese to test whether L2ers, in comparison to Chinese natives, over-depend on lexical-semantic information in sentence processing; this is achieved by comparing L1 and L2 participants’ sensitivity to temporary violations of the selectional restrictions of Chinese transitive verbs. The fourth study examines whether L2ers rely more on discourse-context information in processing Chinese sentences that contain null objects than Chinese natives do. The results of these studies reveal that (a) L2ers are able to access and use the different sources of information (morphosyntactic, lexical-semantic, discourse-context) in online sentence processing as L2 proficiency rises; (b) they do not always over-rely on lexical-semantic or contextual information in L2 sentence processing; (c) they are capable of fully specified processing. The research suggests that L2 processing difficulties are not necessarily indicative of deficient grammatical representations; rather, L2 sentence processing is subject to the influences of task demands, L2 proficiency, and L1 transfer. In addition, the research establishes AJSPR as an appropriate tool for gauging deep-level L2 processing.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/chinese-sentence-processing-first-second-language/docview/1780669454/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zhu, Yanjiao",2020,Third Language Acquisition: German Speech Patterns Produced by Cantonese-English Bilinguals,"There has been on ongoing debate on the effects of multilingual speakers’ first (L1) and second languages (L2) on their third language (L3) development. Research in L3 morpho-syntax suggests at least three possibilities: 1) L3 is predominantly modulated by a typologically similar language; 2) L3 is primarily influenced by L2 due to their psychological relatedness; 3) L3 is simultaneously affected by both L1 and L2. The problem is approached by the current dissertation from the perspective of L3 speech. Focusing on Cantonese-English-German (CEG) trilinguals who were proficient in L2 English and pre-intermediate in L3 German, we explored the roles played by trilinguals’ L1 Cantonese and L2 English on their L3 German speech in three empirical studies, focusing on vowel length, consonant clusters, and speech prosody, respectively. In the vowel length study (Chapter 3), we recorded read speech samples of words containing long and short vowel minimal pairs of 16 monophthongs in German, six monophthongs in British English and six monophthongs in Cantonese from 14 Cantonese-English-German (CEG) trilinguals, 14 Mandarin-English-German (MEG) trilinguals, 14 Cantonese-English (CE) bilinguals, 14 native British English (NE) speakers, and 14 native German speakers (NG) speakers, when the language is applicable. The acoustic analysis of vowel duration and vowel quality (F1 and F2) featuresrevealed both language universal effects and a combined CLI (combined influence from L1 and L2) in L3 vowel production. According to the Desensitization Hypothesis (Bohn, 1995), non-native speakers generally rely heavier on durational cues than on spectral cues to distinguish long and short vowels. This universal feature was observed in both MEG and CEG trilinguals’ productions where their L3 German vowel minimal pairs were more contrastive in duration than in quality. Combined CLI was found in the correlation between the L3 vowels and their acoustically similar L1 and L2 vowels in quality. In addition, a series of between-group&#xa0;comparisons showed that the CLI was multi-directional. The better differentiation of L3 vowel length pairs by CEG trilinguals than MEG trilinguals indicated a positive transfer from L1 to L3, as Cantonese has vowel length contrast while Mandarin does not. Meanwhile, backward transfer from L3 to L1 was shown in the divergence of L1 back vowels produced by CEG trilinguals and CE bilinguals. In the consonant cluster study (Chapter 4), 26 CEG trilinguals read 109 German words containing 17 onset and 21 codas clusters. Their productions were transcribed narrowly in IPA by two raters with adequate German phonological knowledge. The overall accuracy and cluster simplification strategies were analyzed in relation to a set of markedness principles and L1/L2 phonological rules. Like the vowel study, results of consonant cluster production indicated a combined CLI and universal markedness effects in L3 speech. The acquisition of German consonant clusters was facilitated by learners’ knowledge of complex syllable structure in L2 English, while the segmental accuracy of the L3 consonant clusters was affected by positive or negative transfer from both L1 and L2. In the meantime, the insertion of unmarked segments, the sonority-based deletion, and the preference for complex onsets over codas suggested markedness constraints in L3 speech. Finally, there was individual variation within the trilinguals as those who had overseas experience in German-speaking countries were more precise in consonant cluster production. In the speech prosody study (Chapter 5), 13 CEG trilinguals, 13 native English speakers and 13 native German speakers were recorded reading English and German short passages. The CEG trilinguals’ recordings were then presented to 22 native English and 22 native German listeners to rate the degree of foreign accent on a 7-point scale. A variety of prosodic features were calculated from the recordings including rhythm metrics (%V, VarcoV, VarcoC, nPVI-V, and rPVI-C), speech rate, articulation rate, final lengthening (% final word), number of intonational phrases (IP), duration of IP, pitch range, frequency and degree of IP-final rises, and number and length of pauses. Results suggested that CEG trilinguals’ L2 English and L3 German were more syllable-timed than native English and native German were, respectively. Rhythmically, English and German are stress-timed languages and Cantonese is a syllable-timed language, so it was speculated that learners’ L2 and L3 were influenced by L1 Cantonese. Meanwhile, the foreign accent rating results manifested a robust positive correlation between accentedness in L2 English and in L3 German.&#xa0; Since foreign accentedness was demonstrated to be significantly contributed by learners’ prosodic features, the rating results implied L2 transfer in L3 prosody. Taken together, learners’ L3 rhythm was influenced by the L2 English interlanguage which was itself L1-accented. What is more, a great proportion of prosodic features involved disfluencies and were independent of language transfer. In comparison to results in the first two studies on L3 consonants and vowels, L3 prosody as an interface phenomenon between lexicon, phonology, syntax and pragmatics was as prominently affected by a combined CLI. Instead, the developmental universals were more extensively shown in L3 prosodic acquisition. The three studies collectively suggest the third possibility among the three proposals raised at the beginning: the L3 speech is shaped by bilingual learners’ both L1 and L2 phonological systems. Such a combined CLI takes different forms. It is a simultaneous transfer in vowel production, a selective transfer in consonant production and a successive transfer in prosody production. Additionally, depending on the structure under examination, L3 speech is conditioned by universal constraints that apply to all human speech to different degrees. Therefore, L3 speech is a complex and dynamic entity which could not be fully understood without referring to the relationship between the target L3 and the related L1/L2 structures and the general linguistic universals.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/third-language-acquisition-german-speech-patterns/docview/2818595924/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Bie, Soh Siak",2020,The Effects of Task Complexity and Task Condition on L2 Individual Writing and Peer Interaction,"This study adopts the Cognition Hypothesis to examine the effects of task complexity, (+/- causal reasoning demand ) and task condition ( individual, dyadic and triadic groupings ) on the L2 individual writing and peer interaction. A 2 (Task Complexity) x 3 (Task Condition) repeated-measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) research design, was employed on 36 Malaysian university students. Six argumentative topic-based written texts were produced by each participant in each of the three sessions. In each of the sessions, i.e. individual, dyadic and triadic, participants experienced two argumentative tasks: one simple and another complex based on the principle of natural complexity progression. The individual session was set as baseline data to compare results of the Second Language (L2) individual writing and peer interaction in dyadic and triadic conditions. For the dyadic and triadic sessions, participants first discussed each of the simple and complex topics given and then proceeded to write on each topic individually. In total, 216 written texts were analysed for lexical and syntactic Complexities, morphosyntactic Accuracy and Fluency (CAF) while transcripts of interaction totalling 15 hours were analysed in terms of Negotiation of Meaning (NoM), Language-Related Episodes (LREs) and uptakes of recast. Results of CAF on the L2 individual written production revealed that task complexity is statistically significantly different for certain dimensions of lexical and syntactic complexities, accuracy, text length but not for fluency. Task condition on the other hand, is statistically significantly different for the measures of lexical and syntactic complexities except for certain dimensions of complexities, like coordinate clause per T-unit, and accuracy, error-free clauses (EFC). For L2 individual writing, tasks that are more complex produced lengthier texts with higher accuracy, EFC and greater syntactic complexity, for mean length of clause (MLC), but not for dependent clause per clause (DCC). As for task condition, triadic grouping produced lengthier texts with higher lexical complexity, for mean segmental type/ token ratio-50 (MSTTR-50) and greater syntactic complexity, for MLC. As for the measure of DCC, dyadic grouping produced dependent clauses that are more varied in the simple task. The baseline data of the individual session produced more fluent L2 individual writing, as compared to dyads followed by triads. Results of the measures of NoM, LREs and Uptakes on the peer interaction revealed that L2 learners in triadic grouping produced higher comprehension checks when negotiating meaning with peers. It also showed that dyadic grouping produced higher partially or incorrectly resolved LREs and unmodified uptakes of recast. In conclusion, the findings lent partial support to Robinson’s Cognition Hypothesis that cognitively more complex tasks increased the L2 production of certain dimensions of lexical and syntactic complexities, like MSTTR-50, MLC and accuracy, EFC. As for the finding of the dimension of syntactic complexity, DCC, it seemed to have a trade-off effect as proposed by Skehan’s Trade-off Hypothesis. Task condition with more number of participants assigned for peer interaction prior to L2 learners’ individual writing seemed to contribute to higher MSTTR-50, MLC and EFC.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-task-complexity-condition-on-l2/docview/2878260109/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Mozgalina, Anastasia",2015,Applying an argument-based approach for validating language proficiency assessments in second language acquisition research: The elicited imitation test for Russian,"This dissertation was motivated by the need for practical suggestions as to what can be done to improve L2 proficiency assessment practices in SLA research. In response, it is proposed that an argument-based approach to validity (Kane, 2006) can be applied to improve SLA test validation practices. To exemplify this approach, a new assessment was developed and interpretive arguments associated with its distinct uses were crafted. The associated inferential claims were then tested empirically. The two intended uses for the new Russian Elicited Imitation Test (EIT) were: controlling participants' initial levels of Russian oracy (study 1) and selecting participants into a study based on their holistic level of speaking and listening proficiency (study 2). To evaluate the accuracy of the score interpretation for the first use, the EIT was administered to 97 Russian learners in Germany and the USA along with a background questionnaire. To evaluate the accuracy of the score interpretation for the second use, the EIT was administered to 67 Russian learners in the US along with the Russian Speaking Test, a listening comprehension test, and a C-test. Multiple descriptive, graphical, and inferential statistical techniques were employed in the data analysis. Of particular utility in study 1 use were descriptive statistics, item response theory analysis, differential item functioning analysis, inter-rater reliability analysis, and correlational analysis. Key to understanding the effectiveness of the EIT for predicting learners' speaking and listening proficiency in study 2 were descriptive statistics, correlational analysis, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, and 95% confidence intervals. The Russian EIT was found to constitute a reliable instrument that functions well with Russian learners in the US and Germany. It showed the ability to differentiate between a wide range of oracy skills, and proposed cut scores were identified to enable the prediction of four distinct levels of the speaking proficiency and to predict a threshold of intermediate listening skills. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for using the argument-based approach for validating assessments in SLA research, and for the use of and future needed research on the Russian EIT and EITs in general.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/applying-argument-based-approach-validating/docview/1673878188/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Preston, Laurel B.",2015,Generativism and Emergentism: Evidence from Second Language Acquisition Studies of Poverty of the Stimulus Phenomena,"This work applies evidence from second language acquisition studies to the question of the existence of an inborn, language-specific system that constrains the set of possible human grammars. Three sets of studies are examined and critiqued. The sets were selected so that the studies within each of the sets are comparable on the basis of the target phenomenon investigated and the experimental techniques, but contrast on the basis of their chosen theoretical frameworks. The target phenomena are the Overt Pronoun Constraint, scrambling, and quantifier scope ambiguities. Each set of studies includes at least one study conducted within the generativist approach, advocating for L2 learner access to an innate language-specific endowment (often called Universal Grammar) that is essential to the acquisition of grammar in the presence of impoverished linguistic input. Also, each set of studies contains at least one study conducted within an emergentist approach, advocating that domain-general learning mechanisms applied to rich and complex linguistic input suffice to explain L2 learner attainment. All of the target phenomena investigated in these studies are constructions that have been argued in the generative literature to pose poverty-of-the-stimulus (POS) problems for L2 learners. That is, the linguistic input typically available to learners in the form of second language input, instruction, and through their first language, has been argued to underdetermine the acquisition of the construction. The poverty of the stimulus is considered a cornerstone argument for the existence of UG. Based on my review and critique of the selected studies, I find that their aggregate empirical results support the generativist approach. However, I do not rest this claim on a POS argument; I argue that the premise of insufficiency of input has not been well enough established for the POS argument to be applied. Instead, I argue that the evidence from these studies is more consistent with generative predictions for sudden, step-wise acquisition of grammatical contrasts, possibly on the basis of limited input, rather than with emergentist predictions for gradual, incremental acquisition on a necessarily substantial amount of input.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/generativism-emergentism-evidence-second-language/docview/1675023831/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lee, Eunji",2015,L2 acquisition of number marking: A bidirectional study of adult learners of Korean and Indonesian,"This study investigates the L2 acquisition of the Korean and Indonesian number systems by adult learners in light of the Feature-Reassembly Approach (henceforth FRA, Lardiere 2009). In considering this approach, Montrul and Yoon (2009) further suggest that subtracting or unlearning existing L1 features may pose greater difficulty than the addition of new L2 features, while Hwang &amp; Lardiere (2013) propose that features more deeply embedded in a feature co-occurrence hierarchy, such as the [±human] feature, will be developmentally acquired later. This dissertation presents the findings of two experiments examining the restrictions on quantifiers with classifiers and/or plural marking by L1 Indonesian-speaking learners of L2 Korean (Study1) and L1 Korean-speaking learners of L2 Indonesian (Study 2). Seventy learners at three L2 Korean proficiency levels along with 40 native controls participated in Study 1, and 61 learners at three L2 Indonesian proficiency levels along with 39 native controls participated in Study 2. The participants of both experiments completed three tasks—a Sentence Completion Task, a Grammaticality Judgment Task and a Multiple-choice Task—designed to probe knowledge of features and restrictions associated with Korean or Indonesian number marking. The results of Study 1 showed that, although there was improvement in L2 Korean learners' performance with increasing proficiency, the advanced learners had still not acquired all the co-occurrence restrictions of the L2 Korean number system; specifically, L2 Korean learners, regardless of proficiency level, showed difficulty in acquiring the more deeply-embedded [human] feature associated with Korean plural marking. On the other hand, the results of Study 2 indicated that while low-proficiency L2 Indonesian learners initially showed some difficulty in subtracting L1-Korean-based features in L2 Indonesian plural marking, the advanced learners successfully acquired the restrictions and required feature matrices of number marking in the target language. The current study suggests that the particular L1-L2 pairing will certainly impact what kind of feature restructuring is required in order to acquire new feature matrices of lexical items in a second language, which will in turn affect the developmental process of acquisition, thus lending additional overall support to the FRA.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-acquisition-number-marking-bidirectional-study/docview/1678621227/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Goss, Seth Joshua",2015,The Effects of Internal and Experience-Based Factors on the Perception of Lexical Pitch Accent by Native and Nonnative Japanese Listeners,"This dissertation explores the influence of both learner-internal cognitive resources and experience-based factors on the perception of Japanese lexical accent. In Japanese, individual words carry a pitch pattern as part of their phonological form, and these accent patterns form a basic prosodic unit of the language. Cross-linguistic speech perception research has focused by and large on phonetic comparisons of a learner's native language (L1) with that of the second language (L2). Yet, a large degree of individual variation in L2 Japanese accent perception ability remains unaccounted for, suggesting that some learners—despite speaking the same L1 and possessing similar learning experiences—are better at attuning to new sound categories than others. Couple this with previous findings indicating that accent perception does not develop in parallel with Japanese proficiency level, and that immersion in the target-language environment seems to provide little advantage, and the need for a listener-focused investigation becomes apparent. The present research thus attempted to clarify this reported variation by looking at a range of learner-variables potentially involved in prosodic perception. Three experiments investigated native and nonnative Japanese listeners' accent perception ability on correctness-judgment and categorization tasks. Experiment 1 looked at L1 Japanese listeners. Experiment 2 focused on advanced learners of Japanese from two language backgrounds, L1 Chinese and L1 Korean speakers. Experiment 3 measured the development of accent perception over a semester of study in L1 English beginning learners of Japanese in two learning contexts, at-home and study-abroad. In all experiments, participants' phonological short-term memory capacity and acoustic pitch sensitivity were measured as learner-internal predictors of accent perception ability. Experience-based factors included L1 background, Japanese lexicon size and learning context. Multiple regression analyses were then used to determine the relative contribution of each of these factors on listeners' perception of lexical pitch accent. The results revealed that for L1 Japanese speakers, who were very accurate at the correctness-judgment task, acoustic sensitivity predicted perception accuracy. Despite possessing robust knowledge of the phonological properties of their L1, this finding suggests that a basic cognitive resource is still active in L1 accent perception. With the advanced learners, two factors were significantly related to their ability to perceive accent—L1 background and L2 lexicon size. On the other hand, for beginning learners, who were still actively acquiring Japanese, the two basic cognitive resources predicted which individuals made the largest gains in perceptual ability over a semester of study. Thus, for L2 Japanese learners, I posit an acoustic-to-lexical continuum for accent acquisition, whereby beginners are reliant on memory and basic acoustic sensitivity to support their listening performance. However, as I observed with the advanced group, learners increasingly rely on their long-term knowledge of L2 word form in perceiving lexical accent. The pedagogical application of these results is discussed in terms of the increased use of form-focused correction of accent and visual supplements in the language classroom to aid lower-capacity learners' perceptual development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-internal-experience-based-factors-on/docview/1700837468/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Bedinghaus, Robert William",2015,The effect of exposure to phonological variation on perceptual categorization and lexical access in second language Spanish: The case of /s/-aspiration in Western Andalusian Spanish,"This dissertation investigates the acquisition of a dialect-specific phonological variant by American English-speaking L2 learners of Spanish who study abroad for one semester in the target dialect region compared to L2 learners who remain at their home university in the traditional language classroom context (‘At-home’ learners) without exposure to the target variant. The perception of aspirated-/s/ in Western Andalusian Spanish, which is unique in its phonetic articulation and is subject to social and stylistic variation, is examined. In this investigation, 33 native speakers of Spanish from Seville, Spain, 10 native speakers of Spanish from regions in which /s/ is not aspirated, 48 L2 learners of Spanish in the study abroad context, and 25 learners of Spanish in the traditional classroom context completed a forced-choice identification task, a lexical decision task, background questionnaires, a grammar test, and a word familiarity questionnaire. Analysis of the patterns of identification and lexical decision related to /s/-aspiration revealed: (1) effects of condition (i.e., the aspirated condition was significantly more difficult for L2 learners than other control conditions), (2) effects of exposure to /s/-aspiration for the L2 groups on the accuracy of identification and lexical decision (i.e., study abroad groups made gains while the at-home group did not), (3) effects of exposure to /s/-aspiration on lexical decision response time (i.e., study abroad learners responded faster to /s/-aspiration over time while at-home learners did not), (4) and some effects of the amount and types of target language use by the L2 learners abroad for the identification task. However, extralinguistic factors such as contact with native speakers and target language use during the semester abroad did not show consistent effects across tasks, which is argued to be a methodological issue. Implications for the study of the effects of extralinguistic factors on linguistic gains during study abroad are discussed. Differences were also found between the two native speaker groups, primarily for the /s/-aspiration condition, indicating dialectal differences in L1 speech perception. This dissertation shows that immersion during study abroad leads to perceptual gains related to a dialect-specific phonological variant, but that traditional research methods for investigating individual differences among study abroad learners must be revised.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-exposure-phonological-variation-on/docview/1706912679/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Marijuan, Silvia Susana",2015,"EL(LA) mapping: An integrated account of learning context, feedback and agreement morphology in the processing of O<sub>cl</sub>VS sentences in advanced L2 Spanish","Previous literature has shown that beginning and intermediate English-speaking learners persistently misinterpret O-cliticVS sentences in Spanish, preferring word order over morphology when assigning semantic functions to the NPs of non-canonical sentences. Following the Competition Model (Bates &amp; MacWhinney, 1982, 1989; MacWhinney, 2012), this dissertation investigated from an on-line and off-line account whether English-speaking advanced learners of Spanish are also prone to such misinterpretations, and whether their reconfiguration of L1 processing strategies benefits from: (a) mismatches in number agreement morphology, (b) immersion experience, and (c) computer-delivered feedback. Three self-paced readings were conducted. In Experiment 1 (N=38), matching/mismatching number agreement between clitic and verb was manipulated to measure the usefulness of contrastive agreement to overcome word order bias. Experiment 2 (N=20) investigated whether a 5-week Study Abroad program promoted learners’ O cl VS sentence development. Experiment 3 (N=90) investigated potential interactions between agreement conditions and the provision or absence of computer-delivered feedback. Results showed that advanced learners continued to rely on word order when interpreting O cl VS sentences, but different agreement conditions were not processed alike. In Experiment 1, accuracy significantly improved in the mismatching condition in which the morphological cue was on the verb. Participants also tended to present longer reading times in the verb of Cl sg V pl S pl structures. In Experiment 2, learners significantly improved at Week 5 and paid more attention to the verb and post-verbal subject, which are highly informative. In Experiment 3, the [+ Feedback] group outperformed the [- Feedback] group, which only received practice decoding manipulated input. Also, the [+ Feedback] group exhibited a speedup across experimental trials in the baseline condition (Cl sg V sg S sg ) whereas the [- Feedback] group exhibited a significant slowdown in the mismatching Cl sg V pl S pl condition. This dissertation has implications for research on intra-subject L2 processing variation and emerging bilingualism. It also contributes to the debate on whether short-term studies overseas influence L2 grammar skills. Finally, the extent to which exposure to manipulated input alone helps learners reconfigure their L2 processing strategies is discussed along with feedback’s potential role in enhancing this process.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/el-la-mapping-integrated-account-learning-context/docview/1707670431/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Albin, Aaron Lee",2015,Typologizing native language influence on intonation in a second language: Three transfer phenomena in Japanese EFL learners,"While a substantial body of research has accumulated regarding how intonation is acquired in a second language (L2), the topic has historically received relatively little attention from mainstream models of L2 phonology. As such, a unified theoretical framework suited to address unique acquisitional challenges specific to this domain of L2 knowledge (such as form-function mapping) has been lacking. The theoretical component of the dissertation makes progress on this front by taking up the issue of crosslinguistic transfer in L2 intonation. Using Mennen's (2015) L2 Intonation Learning theory as a point of departure, the available empirical studies are synthesized into a typology of the different possible ways two languages' intonation systems can mismatch as well as the concomitant implications for transfer. Next, the methodological component of the dissertation presents a framework for overcoming challenges in the analysis of L2 learners' intonation production due to the interlanguage mixing of their native and L2 systems. The proposed method involves first creating a stylization of the learner's intonation contour and then running queries to extract phonologically-relevant features of interest for a particular research question. A novel approach to stylization is also introduced that not only allows for transitions between adjacent pitch targets to have a nonlinear shape but also explicitly parametrizes and stores this nonlinearity for analysis. Finally, these two strands are integrated in a third, empirical component to the dissertation. Three kinds of intonation transfer, representing nodes from different branches of the typology, are examined in Japanese learners of English as a Foreign Language (EFL). For each kind of transfer, fourteen sentences were selected from a large L2 speech corpus (English Speech Database Read by Japanese Students), and productions of each sentence by approximately 20-30 learners were analyzed using the proposed method. Results suggest that the three examined kinds of transfer are stratified into a hierarchy of relative frequency, with some phenomena occurring much more pervasively than others. Together as a whole, the present dissertation lays the groundwork for future research on L2 intonation by not only generating empirical predictions to be tested but also providing the analytical tools for doing so.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/typologizing-native-language-influence-on/docview/1710812538/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lee, Josephine",2015,The interactional organization of bilingual co-teaching in South Korea,"Conversation analytic studies of classroom interaction have uncovered intricate ways in which classroom talk is organized, demonstrating recurrently observed practices and resources of instructional activities. The scope of these studies includes content and language instruction in a diverse range of monolingual, bilingual, multilingual, heritage, and foreign language learning contexts, but such research has mostly focused on typical classroom formations where only one teacher is present in the classroom. This dissertation examines an under-researched context of bilingual co-teaching wherein two teachers – an American and a Korean teacher – concurrently use English and Korean to carry out content-based lessons. Guided by the theoretical and methodological framework of Conversation Analysis (CA), this study takes interest in describing the interactional organization of co-taught lessons as well as the semiotic resources that teachers deploy to coordinate an integrated lesson. The study centers on three analytical topics. Initiation-response-feedback (IRF) sequences exhibit a distinct interactional structure wherein the co-teachers and students flexibly adapt the IRF to manage local classroom contingencies, coordinate student participation, and achieve the curricular focus of the lesson. Analysis of embodiment unveils how the participants use language and nonvocal conduct to build temporally unfolding participation frameworks and construct socially available resources in the organization of second language (L2) vocabulary instruction. Social asymmetries that emerge in co-teacher interaction are shown to be related to the teachers’ differential access to Korean and English language, entitlement to remedy instruction, and authority to student discipline and classroom management. The dissertation concludes with some recommendations for ESL/EFL co-teaching research and collaborative bilingual teaching practices in Korea.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interactional-organization-bilingual-co-teaching/docview/1714102511/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ahn, Hyunjung",2015,Second Language Acquisition of Korean Case by Learners with Different First Languages,"This dissertation examines the role of L2 learners’ first language (L1) in acquiring a target morpho-syntactic feature (case) and learner perceptions of the L2 grammar, specifically, Korean case and case particles. In addition to investigating what and how much is transferred from the L1, the study also looks to see if learners’ perceptions match their actual production. In order to answer these research questions, two quantitative and one qualitative study were used. The initial quantitative study was conducted using an expanded grammaticality judgment task completed by 25 English L1 learners of Korean, with 15 Korean L1 controls. The Key findings from that studied suggest that English L1 learners of Korean acquired nominative case earlier than the accusative case, patterning with Korean L1 acquisition. Also, learners accurately identified the incorrect usage of nominative particles 60% of the time, but only 51% for accusative particles. Building on the findings of that study, speaking and written production tasks were completed by 70 L2 Korean learners, who were divided into nearly equally-sized groups for three different L1s (22 Chinese, 27 English and 21 Japanese). An assumption of the degree of L1 transfer to L2 Korean was made specifically for case, which was that Chinese transferred less than English and English less than Japanese. It was hypothesized that deep transfer —that being the transfer of syntax from the L1—and surface transfer, which is a transfer of morphology, could be investigated (Sabourin et al 2006). The results highlight that learners, regardless of their L1, used more correct case particles in writing than in speaking. The Japanese L1 group had the highest proficiency for case particles, with Chinese being the least proficient. The data confirmed that morphology was transferred ‘over syntax’ from the L1 and the surface transfer of morphology seems to play an important role (Montrul 1997, 1999, 2000; Sabourin et al 2006). Finally, to support and clarify the two quantitative studies a series, of qualitative interviews were conducted with 57 participants, and 9 key informants participated in multiple interviews. L2 learners were aware that their linguistic backgrounds affect feature transferability and the learnability of the target language. Already knowing perceived similar language was seen as beneficial. Kellerman’s Psychotypology (1983) was used to highlights learners’ perceptual language distance between their L1 and L2. In this study, Chinese learners still considered Korean relatively close to their L1, largely due to cultural associations and vocabulary, and that Korean was not difficult to acquire. Learner’s perceptions of ease were not supported by the actual production data. Different motivations also did not seem to be a main factor of the acquisition of case. Therefore, with the findings, it is argued that the role of L1 in terms of the same morphosyntaictic features in both L1 and L2 is tremendous, and that psychotypology and motivation seem to be overridden by the features.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-korean-case-learners/docview/1722049012/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nagano, Marisa",2015,Interpretation of overt pronouns in L1 and L2 Japanese: The role of context,"This dissertation examines the interpretation of Japanese overt 3rd person pronouns by native (N=21) and advanced L1-English/L2-Japanese (N=20) speakers, using interpretation, reaction-time, and eye-tracking data. Previous studies have investigated L1 and L2 pronoun interpretation in null-subject languages like Spanish, Italian, and Greek, finding that L1 speakers tend to show a topic-shift effect for overt pronouns more often than L2ers (Sorace, 2011). Similar studies on Japanese, which allows null subjects but also differs greatly from these languages, have been mixed; crucially, several studies found no antecedent bias for overt pronouns by L1 speakers to begin with (Okuma, 2012; Ueno &amp; Kehler, 2010). This study first argues that Japanese overt 3rd person pronouns differ crucially from those in Italian-like languages, in that they do not elicit a generalized conversational implicature for topic-shift, nor do they fit on an anaphora hierarchy. Instead, Japanese 3rd person pronouns are better analyzed as triggering particularized conversational implicatures, i.e., that their interpretation must be calculated on an utterance-by-utterance basis based on the specific context of each utterance (as opposed to generalized conversational implicatures, which can be cancelled by context but are not created by it). This study further argues that advanced L2 speakers therefore face a different task than L2 speakers of Italian-like languages, and crucially must inhibit English in order to achieve a native-like interpretation pattern.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interpretation-overt-pronouns-l1-l2-japanese-role/docview/1725773750/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Malik-Moraleda, Saima",2024,Language Processing in the Brain Across Diverse Languages and Speakers,"A staggering 7,000 languages are spoken and signed around the world. Furthermore, the majority of the world's population speak two or more languages. Nevertheless, language research-especially in neuroscience - has been limited to primarily monolingual speakers of a couple dozen languages, which makes our understanding of how the language system works incomplete and potentially biased. In my dissertation, I use a precision fMRI approach to paint a more complete picture of language processing in the brain by studying both diverse languages and diverse speakers. Language processing is supported by a set of inter-connected left-lateralized frontal and temporal areas that are jointly referred to as the 'language network'. First, I asked whether core findings about this network that have come from studies of on native speakers of English and a few other languages generalize to speakers of typologically diverse languages. I found that four key properties of the language network - its i) topography, ii) left-hemispheric lateralization, iii) selectivity for language relative to non-linguistic inputs and tasks, and iv) strong functional connectivity are robustly present across 45 languages spanning 11 language families (Malik-Moraleda, Ayyash et al., 2022, Nature Neuroscience). I further extended these results to constructed languages (conlangs), such as Esperanto and Klingon. Constructed languages differ from natural languages in that they were created much more recently, often by a single individual and for diverse (sometimes esoteric) purposes, and are not shaped by learning and processing pressures, at least not to the same degree. I tested neural responses during the processing of five conlangs in proficient speakers, including Esperanto, Klingon, Na'vi, High Valyrian and Dothraki. All constructed languages recruited the same brain areas as natural languages, suggesting that constructed and natural languages share critical features despite their differences, thus constraining the definition of what constitutes a 'language' (Malik-Moraleda et al., 2023, under review). Second, I investigated the neural architecture of bilingual and monolingual speakers. Contra claims that some frontal brain regions in bilingual individuals support both language processing and domain-general executive functions (e.g., Garbin et al, 2010, Coderre et al, 2016), I found no overlap between the language and the executive control networks in either monolingual speakers (replicating past work) or bilingual speakers (Malik-Moraleda et al., in prep). However, I found that bilinguals engaged the executive control network to a greater extent than the monolingual speakers during a demanding spatial working memory task (Malik-Moraleda et al., 2021, Neurobiology of Language). Although this result is in line with the controversial claim that bilinguals exhibit superior executive functions than monolingual speakers (Bialystok, 2001), it remains difficult to link it to bilingual experience specifically, rather than to other features that may differ between these populations. Last, I investigated the language network of polyglots - individuals who have some degree of proficiency in five or more languages. In a group of 34 polyglots, including 16 hyperpolyglots with some knowledge of 10+ languages, I found that all languages-including the participants' native language, non-native languages of varying proficiency, and even unfamiliar languages consistently engaged all areas of the language network. Moreover, the languages that participants rated as higher-proficiency elicited a stronger response, which plausibly reflects greater engagement of linguistic computations. The exception was the native language, which elicited a lower response than a non-native language of similar proficiency. These results contribute to our understanding of how multiple languages co-exist within a single brain (Malik-Moraleda, Jouravlev et al., 2024, Cerebral Cortex).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/language-processing-brain-across-diverse/docview/3168159171/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zhou, Alexis",2024,The Use of Authentic Materials to Train L2 Suprasegmental Features: Evidence from L2 Lexical Tone in Mandarin and L2 Lexical Pitch Accent in Japanese,"Suprasegmental features (i.e., features realized through pitch, volume, and/or duration changes) are particularly difficult for second language learners. This has led to the creation of many different methods of training, often employing the use of experimenter or instructor-created training materials. However, the use of authentic materials for training suprasegmental features remains underexplored. Authentic materials have recently been shown to be useful for some aspects of language learning, such as communicative competence and listening comprehension, while their usefulness for training suprasegmental features remains unclear. This dissertation explores the potential usefulness of authentic materials for training two suprasegmental features, second language (L2) lexical tone in Mandarin and L2 lexical pitch accent in Japanese. For each language, participants were divided into an authentic group and an inauthentic group based on the type of materials they were exposed to during a shadowing task. Participants then used words they shadowed in a visual feedback task, which was chosen due to visual feedback’s previously proven usefulness for training these two features. For each language, L2 productions at the pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest were compared to first language (L1) productions using a previously established analysis known as the CID measure analysis. The resulting time-series plots, CID measures, magnitudes (pitch height), and phases (timing), were analyzed to determine which group, authentic or inauthentic, performed in a more L1-like way at the posttest compared to the pretest. Results suggest that the authentic group outperformed the inauthentic group for three out of four Mandarin tones, and three out of seven Japanese pitch accent patterns. These results begin to show support for the usefulness of authentic materials, with experimental and pedagogical implications for researchers and learners of Mandarin and Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/use-authentic-materials-train-l2-suprasegmental/docview/3143979610/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nguyen, Thanh",2024,The English and Vietnamese of Vietnamese Immigrants in the US,"This study focuses on the Vietnamese community in Texas, aiming to explore the characteristics of English and Vietnamese languages among Vietnamese Americans in the United States when the two languages are in contact. The research investigates cross-linguistic interactions, particularly in vowel production and question formation, with a focus on generational differences within the community. The findings contribute to our understanding of language contact outcomes in immigrant diasporic communities, shedding light on linguistic and social factors influencing language varieties. The study's insights can enhance cultural understanding and integration efforts for Vietnamese immigrants in the U.S. The study conducted within the Vietnamese community in Texas reveals positive indicators for the future maintenance of the Vietnamese heritage language (HL) within the community. While there are variations in perspectives across generations due to different social and linguistic exposures, the overall attitude within this Vietnamese American community is optimistic about using and preserving the Vietnamese HL in the U.S. Participants express pride in speaking the language and a strong desire to maintain it in their host country. Key factors identified for HL maintenance include its role as a communicative tool, facilitating connections with older generations in the family and community, and its identity value. Effective HL maintenance strategies identified in the study involve speaking the heritage language at home and enrolling children in HL classes. Cross-linguistic interactions were found to impact oral language production, with differences between the first language (L1) and second language (L2) and language proficiency being significant driving factors. While participants tended to select standard question structures in both English and Vietnamese when assessing different sets of structures, spontaneous speech revealed a tendency to use more non-standard features than perceived. The study also presents characteristics of English and Vietnamese questions among Vietnamese Americans across generations. In English, first-generation speakers commonly exhibited non-standard features such as Subject- Auxiliary inversion, verb conjugation issues, and plural noun problems. Vietnamese questions by Vietnamese Americans often involved non-standard features related to verb conjugation, interrogative words/phrases, and word choice, with second-generation speakers facing challenges in using copula verbs and interrogative word placement. Additionally, the study explored the production of two English vowel sounds (/ɪ/ and /æ/) and two Vietnamese vowel sounds (/ɯ/ and /ɤ/) among three generation groups within the Texas-based Vietnamese American community. The G1 group’s English sound /ɪ/ is pronounced at a higher position, drifting up towards /i/ while the G2 groups’ /ɪ/ is pronounced with a lower height and a bit further back, drifting towards /e/. The English /æ/ sound by all three groups is produced with a higher and a little more backed position compared to an average American /æ/ sound, moving to /ɛ/ sound. For the Vietnamese sounds /ɯ/ and /ɤ/, all the participants in three groups pronounce these sounds with a lower position and a bit further back in the mouth compared to the reference sounds. The /ɯ/ sound drifts backwards to the Vietnamese /u/ sound, and /ɤ/ is lowered and slightly drifts back to /ɔ/. The study provides valuable insights into the positive outlook for Vietnamese heritage language maintenance in the Texas community, shedding light on linguistic characteristics, HL maintenance strategies, and the impact of cross-linguistic interactions across generations. Further research is recommended to delve deeper into the development of effective strategies that help enhance HL maintenance among the young generations. The latter part emphasizes implications for ESL/EFL teachers and Vietnamese heritage language maintainers, underlining the importance of recognizing language varieties for fostering tolerance and facilitating integration. The study concludes with future directions, emphasizing the need for broader participant representation and a more comprehensive exploration of linguistic elements for a nuanced understanding of cross-linguistic influence between English and Vietnamese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/english-vietnamese-immigrants-us/docview/3142105907/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Morán Bonilla, Pedro Edmundo",2024,"Una Milpa de Storywork, memoria histórica y testimonios cultivada por salvadoreños en “Vancouver”","This dissertation, written and narrated in a spanglish caló and conceived as a Tecomate, is a theoretical and conceptual offering grounded in the praxis of tending to la milpa. The seeds of Ayote-Storywork (Archibald, 2008), Maíz-Memoria Histórica (Astvaldsson, 2011), and Frijol-Testimonio (Reyes &amp; Curry Rodríguez, 2012) were harvested through the ceremony and tradition of holding a pan con café (methodological-method)—and its subsequent pláticas (Latina Feminist Group, 2001; Fierros &amp; Delgado Bernal, 2016; Morales et al., 2023; Mata-Villalta, 2023; Valencia &amp; Campos, 2023) therein— among Contributors (Firstgeneration salvadorian Refugees and Asylum Seekers) exploring Land and Place-based relationships cultivated on vancouver during the 1979 – 1992 period. The Storywork (Archibald, 2008), la Memoria Histórica (Astvaldsson, 2011), and Testimonios (Reyes &amp; Curry Rodríguez, 2012) narrating Contributors’ Forced Migration from el salvador to canadá and their subsequent Land and Place-based relationships, provide insight into the tensions between Contributors’ desire for diasporic futurities on vancouver and for vancouver to be a transitory place— a « pit-stop » on their return to el salvador. This Tecomate argues a) the canadian nation-state’s motivations to allow salvadorian Refugees and Asylum Seekers to sojourn within the canadian territorial claim over Turtle Island is to advance the project of Settler-Colonialism; b) the project of canadian SettlerColonialism, in turn, significantly impacted Contributors’ cultivated Land and Place-based relationships on vancouver. Connected to the canadian nation-state project of SettlerColonialism, is the gentrification of East vancouver—areas, including the Downtown Eastside (DTES), grandview-woodland neighbourhood and the commercial Drive area (places central where salvadorian Refugees and Asylum Seekers lived and gathered during the 1979 – 1992 period)— that displaced historic Indigenous, Black and People of Colour residents and neighbourhoods. For First-generation salvadoreños, the gentrification of the Downtown Eastside (DTES), the grandview-woodland neighbourhood and the commercial Drive area created a profound loss of cultural and social institutions of encuentros which were crucial to diasporic salvadorians cultivating and tending Land and Place-based relationships on East vancouver.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/una-milpa-de-storywork-memoria-histórica-y/docview/3129236090/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Koç, Fatma Şeyma",2024,The Development of Listening and Speaking Skills in EFL Via an Artificially Intelligent Chatbot Application: A Quasi-Experimental Design Study,"This research aimed to explore the effects of using an artificial intelligence chatbot to enhance the listening and speaking skills of Turkish EFL learners. It was also intended to specify the experiences of language learners and strategies for using this tool and identify the characteristics of an ideal artificially intelligent chatbot for language learning. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected towards these aims using a quasi-experimental design. The quantitative data were collected through a quasi-experimental pre- and post-test control group design. The qualitative data were collected through reflective diaries, recordings of student-chatbot interaction, and semi-structured interviews. According to the findings, although there were significant differences within groups regarding pre-test and post-test speaking proficiency exam results, there were no significant differences between groups regarding listening and speaking post-test scores. The qualitative analysis also demonstrated that although learners faced various technical, pedagogic, and social constraints, there were also self-reports of enhanced language knowledge and skills. The interaction data analysis also showed that EFL learners adopted several interactional strategies to negotiate for meaning in the cases of conversational breakdowns. Based on the findings of this study, a framework for developing artificial intelligent chatbots for EFL learners was proposed. For this purpose, this study suggests a conceptual REPOST model, the guidelines for EFL teachers based on optimum AI chatbot qualities, and a teacher training component.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-listening-speaking-skills-efl-via/docview/3122679077/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Minobe, Masaki",2024,The Life Story of an American Learner of Japanese on a Remote Island in Japan: a Cross-cultural Adaptation Perspective,"Since the 2000s, there has been a growing interest in qualitative research in the field of Japanese language education, including life story research (e.g., Miyo, 2015). One of the purposes of life story research in Japanese language education is to pay attention to, listen to, and describe the voices of people to whom Japanese language education has so far paid little attention (Miyo, 2014, 2015a). Many studies have listened to the voices of Japanese language learners living in Japan and described their experiences (e.g., Miyo, 2009; Sato, 2015; Maruyama &amp; Ozawa, 2018). However, many studies have not paid particular attention to the region where the learners are staying. One gets the impression that the place could be anywhere as long as the learners are in Japan. Further, cross-cultural adaptation research often focuses on international cross-cultural contact. However, in recent years, it has been pointed out that cross-cultural contact also involves regional differences within a single country (Gui et al., 2012; Berry, 2016). In other words, foreigners staying in a host country experience not only intercultural contact between their own country and the host country but also intercultural contact arising from regional differences within the host country, making the adaptation process complex. This narrative case study focused on one American learner of Japanese, Kevin (pseudonym), and his experience on Futaba Island (pseudonym) and analyzed his process of cross-cultural adaptation. Data was collected from his diary and semi-structured interviews with him over six months. The collected data were then graphically represented using the method of Trajectory Equifinality Modeling (TEM) (Sato et al., 2009; Sato et al., 2014). The data obtained in this study showed that Kevin’s back-and-forth between Futaba Island and the mainland impeded and facilitated his cross-cultural adaptation in different ways. Unlike people in large cities on the mainland, people on Futaba Island stare at Kevin and treat him as a special guest, which made him aware of cultural barriers, leading him to construct an identity as an outsider and feel, “I will never fully integrate into Japanese society.” Furthermore, when he traveled to the mainland, he experienced reverse culture shock by encountering many American tourists that he cannot see on Futaba Island. Seeing American tourists behaving incompatibly with Japanese cultural norms made Kevin realize that he was more integrated into Japanese society than he had thought. All of this suggests that when considering the cross-cultural adaptation of foreigners staying in Japan, it is essential to take a place-based perspective on where they are in Japan and where they have been during their stay. Furthermore, just because a person is staying in the host country does not mean that cross-cultural adaptation is influenced by factors that are exclusive to the host country. While staying in the host country, one’s cross-cultural adaptation may be influenced by people from or by events in their home country. It is necessary to take into account home country-related factors as well.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/life-story-american-learner-japanese-on-remote/docview/3122643095/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Sakellarios, Marc D.",2024,Not Just Extra Chairs in the Classroom: International Student Struggles With Loneliness and Isolation,"International students in a Japanese university struggled with issues of loneliness, lack of belonging, and feelings of not mattering. These issues inhibited their ability to form friendships with domestic students. This study sought to investigate causes and find actionable solutions to international student social networking issues. Participants and data collected in Cycle 1 consisted of international students who offered their experiential insights through ten semi-structured interviews. Alongside domestic and international students, steps were designed, implemented, and evaluated in Cycle 2 in order to empower the international student minority group, and encourage interaction and social bonds between international and domestic students. The Cultural Awareness Circle was founded and met on Mondays throughout the course of the 2023/24 fall semester. 12 meetings were held in which both international and domestic students planned and implemented two mixer events with the goal of increasing international and domestic student interaction and fostering a sense of community. Evaluating the results of the Action Research study included a thorough assessment through member checking, questionnaires, and an exit interview with a participating international student. Student participants and collaborators/allies provided feedback that assisted in the research design and evaluation process. The study concluded that the Cultural Awareness Circle empowered student participants to plan and implement two mixer events that positively impacted international students’ ability to form friendships and interact with their fellow classmates. Implications for the organization included increased intercultural interaction, integration of international student populations, and increased feelings of positivity towards the university by both international and domestic students.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/not-just-extra-chairs-classroom-international/docview/3100997200/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Denison, George Clinton",2024,The Development of Second Language Writing Across the Lexical and Communicative Dimensions of Performance,"Enabling learners to successfully use their second language (L2) in meaningful ways is a critical goal of instruction. Ultimately, most learners want to meet the L2 demands of the contexts in which they will use the language. To accomplish this, learners must develop linguistic knowledge and apply it in a manner that is contextually appropriate considering the requirements of the task at hand. In other words, learners must develop their L2 across both linguistic and communicative aspects to use it successfully. However, there is a paucity of L2 research in which linguistic and communicative performance have been simultaneously investigated. In this study, I investigated the development of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ L2 written production across the lexical and communicative dimensions of performance. The study involved 290 Japanese participants recruited from 20 intact EFL classes at four tertiary educational institutions in Japan, representing a wide range of L2 English proficiency levels and instructional contexts. The study used a non-intervention, repeated-measures design, allowing for the general development of participants’ L2 English writing to be examined. Participants’ L2 English written responses were collected using four argumentative writing tasks, which were administered at the beginning and end of the first and second semesters in a counterbalanced manner. Although a total of 952 responses were collected, responses shorter than 50 words were removed, leaving a total of 775 responses written by 250 participants. The 775 responses included in the primary analyses constituted a corpus of 89,122 words. Twenty-four single-word, multi-word, and lexical variation measures were calculated for the responses and subjected to an exploratory factor analysis. Seven latent lexical factors were identified in the data: High-Frequency Trigrams, Lexical Clarity, High-Frequency Bigrams, Lexical Variation, Lexical Breadth, Low-Frequency N-Grams, and Directional Association Strength of N-Grams. In addition, raters scored the responses for functional adequacy (i.e., Content, Comprehensibility, Organization, and Task Completion) and Lexical Appropriateness. The scores were analyzed using many-facet Rasch measurement, which converted the ordinal scores into equal-interval measures that had been adjusted for the influences of task and rater severity. The lexical factor scores and communicative Rasch measures were examined using linear mixed modeling, dominance analysis, and latent growth modeling to investigate (a) if and how lexical development had occurred, (b) if and how communicative development had occurred, (c) the relationships between the lexical and communicative components, and (d) the relationship between lexical and communicative growth. For the lexical factors, the results indicated that Directional Association Strength of N-Grams scores increased in a linear manner. Directional Association Strength of N-Grams comprised ΔP scores, which indicate the degree to which the first word(s) are predictive of the following word(s) in two- and three-word combinations. Thus, the results indicated that participants’ use of multi-word expressions improved. On the other hand, Lexical Clarity, which comprised imageability, concreteness, meaningfulness, and hypernymy scores, showed quadratic change, with scores improving and then regressing. Thus, the findings provide evidence of differing developmental trends for lexical aspects of L2 writing. For the communicative measures, the results indicated that Comprehensibility, Organization, and Lexical Appropriateness changed substantially over time. Improvement of Task Completion was dependent on the university context, and little change was observed for Content. Lexical Appropriateness showed the most improvement, with evidence of both linear and quadratic change. Bias interaction analyses also confirmed the presence of linear and quadratic trends for the communicative measures. Thus, the findings provide evidence of differing developmental trends for communicative aspects of L2 writing. For the relationships between the lexical and communicative components, the results indicated that two lexical factors were of key importance: Lexical Variation and Directional Association Strength of N-Grams. Lexical Variation was found to predict Content, Organization, and Task Completion; and Directional Association Strength of N-Grams was found to predict Comprehensibility and Lexical Appropriateness. The findings suggest that L2 performance assessments should not conflate measurement of lexical variation and use of multi-word expressions because they diverge in terms of the communicative outcomes they predict. The results also indicated a positive relationship between lexical and communicative development. A parallel process latent growth model was constructed that related lexical and communicative growth. The paths tested in the model suggest participants who had lower initial communicative scores were able to increase their lexical scores at faster rates, which in turn leveraged communicative growth. The findings highlight the potential for learners to improve their communicative ability through a targeted focus on multi-word expressions.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-second-language-writing-across/docview/3099574948/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Gilbert, Charlène",2024,Referential Computations and <em>Wh</em>-Movement in Native and Non-native Processing of French: Evidence From Reading Times,"Research in first-language (L1) sentence processing has found evidence that language comprehenders use binding condition A as a filter to rule out noun phrases that are binding-inaccessible before proceeding with the task of finding the correct antecedent. Sturt (2013) notes that this strategy does not appear to apply to advanced speakers of second-language (L2) English, even when they demonstrate a strong understanding of English binding constraints in off-line tasks. This is consistent with the Shallow Structure Hypothesis—the view that L2 speakers do not compute all the syntactic details incrementally in real time, and rely more heavily on other sources of information during initial stages of processing (Clahsen &amp; Felser 2006; 2018). My dissertation focuses on L1 vs. L2 sentence processing in French by investigating resolution of anaphora subject to binding condition A (anaphors) and B (pronouns) under reconstruction (a syntactic phenomenon linked to wh-movement). To do so, two self-paced reading tasks were designed. The participants included 25 L1 French speakers and 25 advanced/intermediate L2 French speakers. The first task examined the processing of the pronouns lui ‘him’ and elle ‘her’ in noun complements (introduced by de ‘of’) vs. adjuncts (introduced by par ‘by’). The second task focused on the processing of the French reciprocal anaphor l’un l’autre ‘one another’ in noun complements (introduced by au sujet de ‘about’), examining the influence of number features on the search for a possible antecedent. The main findings are the following: a) L1 speakers provided evidence of faster processing, b) L2 learners are sensitive to subtle syntactic information in real-time referential computations, with stronger statistical effects when proficiency is taken into account, and c) there is psychological&#xa0;evidence for successive cyclicity in the processing of a second language. The results disprove the Shallow Structure Hypothesis.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/referential-computations-em-wh-movement-native/docview/3098124337/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lozada Gómez, David Rubén",2024,Developing L2 Pragmatic Competence Through Collaborative Dialogue: A Study on EFL Learners’ Request-Making in Interaction,"Over the years, second language acquisition (SLA) researchers have become increasingly interested in the teaching of second language (L2) pragmatics. Among the questions that they have addressed are whether L2 pragmatics is teachable; whether instruction produces better results than exposure alone; and whether different teaching methods lead to different learning outcomes (Plonsky &amp; Zhuang, 2019; Rose, 2005; Taguchi, 2015). Today, a large body of research exists on instructed pragmatics learning. However, given their predominantly cognitive/ psycholinguistic orientation (Taguchi, 2011b, 2015; Taguchi &amp; Roever, 2017), most interventional studies have focused on comparing the benefits of explicit and implicit instruction. In addition, pragmatic features such as speech acts have been commonly taught as single-turn utterances, disregarding the fundamentally co-constructed and interactional nature of their production and achievement in conversation (Félix-Brasdefer, 2019; Kasper, 2006, 2009). The present study aimed to fill these gaps in the literature by investigating the effects of collaborative dialogue on L2 learners’ awareness and use of requests in interaction. In addition, the study aimed to document the nature of the collaborative dialogue that the learners generated through consciousness-raising (CR) tasks and how such collaborative dialogue was mediated by their L2 proficiency level. The participants were Spanish-speaking learners of English as a foreign language who were divided into low-, mid-, and high-level dyads and asked to verbalize their reflections as they compared their requests with those produced by English native speakers in the same situations. During task performance, the learners’ collaborative dialogue was audio-recorded and subsequently analyzed for the quantity (occurrence), type (focus), and quality (level of engagement) of the pragmatic-related episodes (PREs) created. Instructional effects were assessed by analyzing, quantitatively and qualitatively, the collaborative dialogue data (PREs) and the request data (roleplays) that were collected during the study. The results indicated that in comparison to other tasks used in the instructed L2 pragmatics literature, the frequency of the PREs produced through CR tasks seemed to be higher. Most of the PREs dealt with pragmalinguistics, followed by those focused on sociopragmatics, and discourse. The PREs elicited more limited than elaborate engagement. In addition, L2 proficiency seemed not to affect the quantity, type, and quality of the learners’ PREs. In terms of instructional effects, the results showed gains in the learners’ production of requests in interaction, as evidenced by the range of request strategies, request modifiers, and patterns of sequential organization that they employed in their roleplays. The frequency of use of such request features was found to be associated with the quality of the PREs, that is, the more the learners discussed the features with elaborate engagement, the more they supplied them in their roleplay interactions. Finally, analysis of the learners’ verbalized reflections demonstrated that collaborative dialogue did not raise their L2 pragmatic awareness, as they were unable to fully understand the rules and conventions underlying the appropriate use of requests in interaction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/developing-l2-pragmatic-competence-through/docview/3093886716/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Clark, Jillian",2024,Production of Null Arguments by L2 Learners of Japanese,"Null arguments, the omission of an argument like a subject or object, is a widespread phenomenon in Japanese. Since acquiring the knowledge of using null arguments is essential for those learning Japanese, this study addresses the usage of null subjects and objects by intermediate L2 learners of Japanese currently enrolled in Japanese classes at Indiana University. It investigates whether they omit at the same rate as native speakers, whether there is asymmetry between their use of null subjects and null objects, and how an individual’s intention might influence their argument use in a specific context. This study included three different tasks, which were split into two sessions; the first session included a writing task and a language proficiency and exposure survey while the second session was an optional follow-up interview. A group of nine L2-Japanese learners and four native Japanese speakers completed the writing task. The resulting writing samples provided a collection of null and overt subjects and objects that were coded for insertability and omittability. The survey was completed only by the L2 learners. Five of the nine learners volunteered to complete the follow-up interview. Results of the study support the prediction that, although the learners’ production of different argument types was near native-like, the two groups varied greatly in the production of objects. The proportion of null to overt subjects and objects produced by the L2 learners was similar to that of the L1 speakers, but the coding of objects produced by the learners spanned a much wider scale than the native speakers. The data collected during follow-up interviews show that all five participants expressed awareness of their use of null arguments, but they seemed more aware of how to use null subjects than null objects. The results from this study have created a number of new questions that can be answered in future research.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/production-null-arguments-l2-learners-japanese/docview/3089820064/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lin, Kaiying",2024,On Mandarin Unaccusativity: A Perspective From Language Acquisition,"The field of Linguistics has long been interested in the verb meanings of intransitive verbs and their argument structure, specifically the breakdown of intransitive verbs into unaccusative and unergative verb types.

The diverse categories and exceptional outcomes from various paradigms across multiple languages have further complicated attempts to find a definitive understanding of unaccusativity.

"Malone, Jonathan Edward",2024,Toward a Theory-Based Account of the L2 Vocabulary Processing and Learning Benefits of Reading While Listening,"The tantalizing prospects of learning benefits from multimodal conditions on second language (L2) learning in general, and L2 vocabulary development in particular, have important implications. Indeed, opening a language learning app on any device provides the immediate experience of simultaneous input modalities, and a wide range of input types. But how helpful is multimodality to vocabulary learning, especially when the focus of the learner is on the meaning of a text? Researchers have manipulated input to compare a variety of learning conditions and examined vocabulary learning gains. However, relatively few within second language acquisition (SLA) have utilized real-time monitoring of learner behavior to examine how learners encounter new words over multiple exposures during a reading task, and how the quality of these encounters may or may not influence explicit learning outcomes. Even fewer have mapped differences in the developmental trajectory of form-form and form-meaning mapping for new words at the group level, comparing reading only (RO) with reading while listening (RWL). Crucially, to my knowledge, none have made or tested predictions within RWL on possible psycholinguistic source(s) of reported benefits. Our understanding of outcome benefits, along with implications for optimizing input in classroom or individual instructed contexts, is thereby quite limited. My dissertation study was designed to address each of these issues. 119 advanced English learners read or read while listening to a 7,400-word short story under incidental conditions (time pressure, focus on comprehension, and unannounced posttest outcomes). The text was embedded with 25 target pseudoword items 10 times each, with target items replacing real nouns in object positions. Measures of real-time form learning were defined as faster reading times and fewer total visits to the new words across encounters (Godfroid, 2020b), and there were three post-exposure measures of explicit word knowledge (form recognition, meaning recognition, meaning recall). New to this area of vocabulary research, outcome items were presented in randomized item modality (visual or auditory), to ensure congruence between treatment and test items and reducing modality-specific testing bias (Jelani &amp; Boers, 2018). Group-level comparisons examined differences in (1) developmental trajectory of form familiarity and meaning integration for RO and RWL groups, (2) learning outcomes, and (3) effects of multi-componential L2 proficiency and phonological short-term memory (PSTM) skills on processing and learning outcomes. Within-RWL analyses operationalized a theoretical source of benefit (reading slightly ahead of the audio) and its impact on reading time and posttest learning gains. Findings indicated differences between RO and RWL across three measures of eye movements: (1) gaze duration (GD), a measure of form familiarity with new words; (2) total reading time (TRT), a measure of meaning integration; and (3) visit count, or the total number of encounters looking at the words. The overall pattern for RWL indicated longer initial reading times for new words, fewer re-readings, and steadier decrease in GD and TRT across encounters. Additionally, differences in learning outcomes were most clearly revealed through auditory test items, with RWL superior to RO across all three posttest outcome measures, and a group by item modality interaction. In other words, RWL indicated superior overall effects compared with RO across all items in form recognition and meaning recall, across all three posttests in auditory items, and better scores on visual than auditory items in RO (but equal across test item modality in RWL). Within-RWL analyses revealed that reading ahead of the audio was a positive predictor of TRT, as well as the most difficult of the three outcome measures (meaning recall). While PSTM predicted processing of new words, it did not predict outcomes for any of the three measures of vocabulary learning gains for advanced-level L2 readers. In sum, this study provides convergent evidence that process (form-form / form-meaning acquisition) and product (learning gains) are both positively impacted for new words under multimodal incidental conditions for advanced L2 learners, along with an initial indication that audiovisual asynchrony may play a role in RWL benefits in learning new words above and beyond L2 proficiency or memory skills.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/toward-theory-based-account-l2-vocabulary/docview/3074097508/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Bae, Hyun",2024,The Multidirectional Effect of Input Factors on Trilingual Processing: The Role of Length of Residence,"There has been increasing L3 research on L3 transfer selectivity, especially concerning which factor triggers crosslinguistic influence during L3 acquisition. According to Slabakova’s (2016) Scalpel Model, every linguistic property has distinct and unique input factors regarding L3 acquisition such as high/low frequency or positive/negative input. Prior research on L3 has considerably enhanced the understanding of the impact of cognitive and psychological factors, such as the order of language acquisition, typological similarities between L1 and L3 or L2 and L3, and the structural characteristics of the features involved in L3 acquisition. Nevertheless, only a few studies focused on the significance of input on L3 acquisition. In this regard, this dissertation explores whether input, particularly the length of residence, influences parsing preference of ambiguous relative clauses (RCs) (e.g., I met the king of the servant who rules the kingdom) in L3 acquisition. Rather than investigating the unidirectional crosslinguistic influence as in L1 or/and L2 to L3, this dissertation investigates multidirectional crosslinguistic influences, specifically targeting the interaction between non-native languages, L2 to L3 and L3 to L2. This is because earlier L3 studies have predominantly addressed one-way transfer selectivity, creating a gap in the domain of multidirectional aspects of crosslinguistic influence in L3 acquisition. Accordingly, this dissertation examines the impact of residence in a country where a non-native language, either L2 or L3, is spoken, by using both offline timed comprehension and online self-paced reading tasks. The data gathered from the offline timed comprehension tasks carried out by L1- Mandarin speakers who have learned both English and Korean as L2 or L3 with varying length of Korean residence, mainly quantified by the number of years, indicates that Korean residence significantly influences their non-native (L2 or L3) English and Korean resolution of ambiguous RCs. However, results from online self-paced reading tasks did not reveal a significant impact from Korean residence. Thus, the overall results emphasize the substantial role of living in a country where a non-native language is spoken, particularly in offline parsing scenarios, while its impact on online parsing appears limited. It was also revealed that controlling and measuring language input in a L3 context demands more refined and specific methods compared to a L2 context. Overall, this dissertation presents a compelling case for emphasizing the role of input in L3 acquisition, aligning with the Scalpel Model.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/multidirectional-effect-input-factors-on/docview/3069317436/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Elshawish, Mustafa Fuzi",2014,Investigating the Writing Strategies of Fourth Year Libyan University Students of English: Strategy Differences between Good and Poor Writers of English,"The present study is an investigation of the composing processes and writing strategies of fourth year Libyan university students majoring in English as a foreign language. The study predominantly adopts a qualitative approach, using a number of research methods, namely think-aloud protocols, semi-structured interviews, and observations. The student participants involved in the investigation belonged to two groups: good writers (N=5), and poor writers (N=6). The teacher informants (N=3) are among those who teach composition classes to students in the English department, and have long experience in teaching in the university stage of education. The composing sessions were audio-taped, transcribed and coded for analysis, along with the drafts and the final written compositions. The think-aloud sessions were followed by semi-structured interviews that were conducted with both students and teachers. The research was guided by three questions: (1) What strategies do Libyan students of English as a foreign language use while writing in English? (2) Do proficient and less proficient writers differ in their strategy use? (3) If yes, how and why do they differ? Analysis of the data collected from think-aloud protocols revealed that the subjects made use of various strategies, and sub-strategies while composing. The good writers‘ use of strategies differed from the poor writers‘ in terms of frequency and quality, and there seems to be a variation in recursiveness in subjects‘ writing process in relation to their writing proficiency and language competence.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigating-writing-strategies-fourth-year/docview/2399346846/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Zhang, Xian",2014,The teachability hypothesis and concept-based instruction topicalization in Chinese as a second language,"Teachability Hypothesis (TH, Pienemann, 1984, 1987, 1989) claims that formal instruction cannot affect the route of acquisition of processing procedures predicted by Processability Theory (PT, Pienemann, 1998). Aligned with Piagetian theory, Pienemann argues that L2 instruction is subordinated to L2 development and therefore cannot override PT’s universal developmental sequences. Vygotsky (1978) argued that psychological development is neither predetermined nor universal. It depends on the quality of cognitive tools and social relationships, most especially in educational settings. This thesis tests the central claim of the Teachability Hypothesis by investigating whether instructions that follow Gal’perin’s (1970) Systemic Theoretical Instruction (conceptbased instruction) would change the L2 Chinese developmental sequence predicted by the Topic Hypothesis, an extension of PT (Pienemann, Biase, &amp; Kawaguchi, 2005). According to the Topic Hypothesis, L2 Chinese learners must progress through three sequential stages: SVO, ADJ+SVO, OSV. Eight beginning L2 Chinese learners and two heritage speakers took part in this study. In the first experiment, six participants at the SVO stage were taught the OSV structure. It was found that these learners were capable of producing OSV structure before they could produce ADJ+SVO structure. In the second experiment, two participants at the SVO stage were taught the OSV and the ADJ+SVO structure in the same instruction session. Results indicate that both the OSV and the ADJ+SVO structure were processable to the two learners. In the third experiment, it was found that the two heritage speaker could produce a higher stage grammar structure (the ba-construction, Gao, 2009; Wang, 2012) without the capability of processing a lower stage grammar structure (the OSV structure). All these results highlight Vygotsky’s argument that instruction can be an important factor that leads cognitive development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/teachability-hypothesis-concept-based-instruction/docview/1846123376/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tominaga, Waka",2014,"Validating the scoring inference of the Japanese OPI ratings: The use of extended turns, connective expressions, and discourse organization","Adopting Kane’s (2006) argument-based approach to validity as a guiding framework, this study examined the scoring inference of the OPI ratings based on the level descriptions in the ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines, with a focus on the “text type” criterion. The Guidelines state that Intermediate speakers typically produce “sentences” while Advanced speakers are capable of using “connected discourse of paragraph length” (ACTFL, 2012c, pp. 5–8). However, there is little empirical evidence to support such characterizations. In an attempt to fill this gap, this conversation analytic study investigated the appropriateness of the text type criterion by examining how Intermediate and Advanced candidates participated in turn-taking in the OPI and responded to the OPI’s narration and description tasks, which were designed to elicit a “connected discourse of paragraph length.” The focal data consisted of audio/video recordings of 15 face-to-face Japanese OPIs. From a larger pool of OPI data collected for program assessment research by the College of Languages, Linguistics, and Literature at the University of Hawai‘i at Manoa, three OPIs for each of the five (sub)levels ranging from Intermediate-Low to Advanced-Mid were randomly selected and transcribed. The study found that while the candidates at higher proficiency levels tended to demonstrate superior ability to use connective expressions in their discourse, the level descriptions concerning the text type criterion did not necessarily match actual candidate performance, especially for the lower proficiency levels (Intermediate-Low/Mid). The problems seemed to reside in the Guidelines’ failure to recognize the candidates’ interactional competence to produce sequentially appropriate actions in an orderly manner, as well as the use of units of analysis for writing (e.g., sentences, paragraphs) to describe oral proficiency. Further research is called for in order to collect more empirical evidence to inform future revisions of the Guidelines.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/validating-scoring-inference-japanese-opi-ratings/docview/1652520382/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Li, Houxiang",2013,Grammar and lexis in interaction: A conversation analysis of talk in small group work in ESL classes,"This dissertation investigates how adult L2 speakers deploy grammatical and lexical resources in organizing their conjoined participation in text-based, task-oriented small group work. Nine hours and seventeen minutes of video recordings of twenty reading circle activities from three college-level ESL classes constitute the data for the study. Using conversation analysis as an analytical framework, the study addresses two research foci: grammar-in-interaction and lexis-in-interaction. When perturbations or disfluencies occur as the first speaker is in the midst of producing her turn-construction unit (TCU), which is not uncommon in L2 talk, an opportunity space is available for the second speaker to make a mid-TCU entry. Five actions that can occur in such an opportunity space are described: collaborative completion, handover, turn-terminating yeah , takeover, and curtailment. In collaborative completion, the second speaker brings the first speaker's TCU to grammatical or pragmatic completion to achieve various interactional functions. Handover, turn terminating yeah , takeover, and curtailment, on the other hand, are actions deployed to indicate that speaker transfer is relevant or is effected so that the first speaker can abandon a perturbation-filled TCU that she has much trouble in constructing. What emerges from such grammatical and turn-taking practices is an image of the participants as L2 learners who, with emerging interactional competence, and through collaborative efforts, are able to resolve grammatical difficulties in TCU construction on some occasions while on other occasions having to resort to circumvention strategies due to a lack of grammatical or linguistic resources. This study thus presents a more complete picture of L2 speakers' grammatical and interactional competences than previous CA studies. In lexis-in-interaction, analytic attention is turned to how epistemics impacts lexis-focused interactions. Specifically, three practices are described: uncertainty-marking, letting-it-pass, and understanding check questions. Uncertainty-marking is deployed by the speaker to initiate repair on a lexical item, whose pronunciation, form, meaning, or use she is uncertain about, and to elicit other-repair. Letting-it-pass and understanding check questions are practices deployed by the discussion leader to conceal her unknowing status or to uphold a dissembled knowing status with regard to the definition of a particular lexical item. The analysis of these practices demonstrates that opportunities for vocabulary learning is intimately bound up with the participants' practical concerns of their epistemic status in relation to the target word and to each other as members or leaders of a discussion group.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/grammar-lexis-interaction-conversation-analysis/docview/1774389355/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lumley, Joseph Robert",2013,Pragmatic Perspectives on the Second Language Acquisition of Person Reference in Japanese: A Longitudinal Study,"This thesis presents a longitudinal study of the acquisition of person reference in Japanese by second language (L2) learners whose first language is English. Reference to persons is of particular interest in pragmatics as an area where discourse-pragmatic (referential coherence) and social (status marking) aspects of language intersect. Previous studies have discussed L2 reference as well as politeness and status marking in second languages. However, person reference itself has rarely been the object of investigation. The original contribution of this thesis is to include both social and discourse-pragmatic theories in a longitudinal study of this area of learner language. The study uses data from six learners of L2 Japanese after two years’ classroom instruction in the UK, and after a further year’s study in Japan, as well as native Japanese data. A range of communicative tasks is used to elicit person reference while providing variation in social and discourse-pragmatic conditions. Learners’ basic route of discourse-pragmatic development thus revealed is one where initial overexplicitness in person reference reduces over time but does not disappear altogether. As they develop, learners supply null forms more readily but overuse them in certain lower accessibility contexts. Physical presence of the referent is consistently the most important accessibility-determining factor for learners; over time they become more responsive to competition for the role of antecedent. For social factors, the terms used to refer to high-status persons are generally native-like from the pre-study abroad stage onwards. In many other respects, however, learners after study abroad use a greater range of forms and strategies than they do at the earlier stage. However, the results of this are not necessarily target-like. These findings are in many respects consistent with those of previous studies, but are reached using a more detailed conception of social and discourse-pragmatic contexts than previous studies tend to. However, the often-reported overuse of informal variants is not found here, and the post-study abroad overuse of null forms found here is not reported elsewhere. I argue that these findings are consistent with a view of L2 pragmatic development as a process of gaining attentional control over pre-existing pragmatic representations (Bialystok 1994). Furthermore, accessibility theory (Ariel 1990), which is very rarely used in L2 research, is shown to provide a useful framework for analysing learners’ discourse-pragmatic development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/pragmatic-perspectives-on-second-language/docview/2296367409/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Yang, Yanqiu",2013,Cognitive Case Studies of Chinese in Discourse Analysis and Classroom Teaching,"In the first case study, a piece of recent BBC news reported on Chinese netizens leaving random but funny comments on a Western website attracted people’s attention. A closer look at those comments reveals that understanding the Chinese netizens’ comments requires metaphorical and cultural knowledge. This study starts with theoretical explanations on metaphor from different perspectives and then presents cultural variations in Western and Eastern metaphors. With theories and cultures grounded, a detailed analysis was done to show people without Chinese cultural background how to understand the Chinese Internet metaphors that drew people’s attention. The second case study takes a critical discourse analysis approach to investigate metaphors in political discourses in Chinese. Five pieces of Chinese government reports were studied. Metaphor, revealing how we think about the world, encompasses cultural and social factors. It functions differently for different communication purpose. The current study proves the persuasive role of metaphor in political discourse which can evoke people’s emotional response, for the governing group to have an ideological influence on how people conceptualize things. The third case study applies word recognition as part of the classroom instruction in the form of meaning, character and pronunciation, to investigate whether training on either two of the three constituents can improve students’ vocabulary acquisition. The results showed that, for new learners, the bond between characters and either pronunciation or meaning is weak. Training in either character with meaning or character with pronunciation has positive effects and training to enhance the relation between character and pronunciation also retrieve meaning, which brings a three-way benefit.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/cognitive-case-studies-chinese-discourse-analysis/docview/2675223476/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Barski, Ewelina",2013,Spanish and Polish Heritage Speakers in Canada: The Overt Pronoun Constraint,"This study investigates the grammar of Spanish and Polish heritage speakers in Canada: Speakers who grew up speaking their family language at home, where the community language is English. Studies looking at the language of heritage speakers investigate the stability of language and how grammar develops under reduced input conditions (Benmamoun et al., 2010). The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of reduced input on a component within the Null-Subject Parameter - the Overt Pronoun Constraint (OPC) (Montalbetti, 1984). The goal is to understand the interpretations that heritage speakers assign to overt pronouns in very specific contexts. The OPC is a restriction on an overt pronoun’s possible coreferent. It states the restrictions on this pronoun when its coreferent is a quantified expression ( someone, who ). As null-subject languages, in Spanish and Polish an overt pronoun in the subordinate clause cannot be bound by a quantified expression ( Nadiei cree que él j/*i va a ganar ‘No one believes that he will win’). The overt pronoun needs to be free within its binding domain. Following Montalbetti (1984), I assume that all quantifiers will be treated equally. Moreover, following a generative framework, it is assumed that that the Null Subject Parameter is set early in the grammars of these null-subject heritage languages (Chomsky, 1981; Jaeggli, 1982; Rizzi, 1982), and thus they will demonstrate understanding of the interpretative restrictions found with subordinate overt pronouns with quantified antecedents. Results from this study were gathered from four groups of speakers with 20 participants in each group: Spanish heritage, Spanish monolingual, Polish heritage, Polish monolingual. Participants completed two comprehension tasks: a Picture-Matching task, and a Sentence-Selection task. Both tasks tested interpretation of the implicit knowledge of the OPC with quantified antecedents. Results for the Picture-Matching task show that advanced heritage speakers understand the interpretative contrast present with overt and null pronouns within OPC contexts. However, heritage speakers appear to have more difficulty in the SentenceSelection task: They do not differentiate between null and overt pronouns. Results suggest lower-proficiency participants have difficulty with the reading/comprehension component of the task, but the OPC remains in their grammars.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/spanish-polish-heritage-speakers-canada-overt/docview/2701129824/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Schwartz, Tomoko",2013,Examination of Factors that Promote Transformative Learning Experiences of College-Level Adult Learners of Foreign Languages,"The purpose of this study was to examine factors that promote transformative learning experiences of college-level adult learners of foreign languages. This study was conducted to analyze how college-level adult learners of foreign languages experience transformative learning through educational and non-educational experiences. Mezirow’s transformative learning theory (Mezirow, 1991a, 1994, 1995, 2000, 2003) provided the theoretical framework for this study. A mixed-methods research design was used to address the research questions. The students who were enrolled in one of the foreign language courses at a four-year southeastern public university during the Spring 2013 semester were asked to participate in this study. An online version of the modified Learning Activities Survey (LAS) ( N =59) together with follow-up interviews ( N =7) were used in this study. Analysis of online survey data was administered mainly with the Pearson chi-square tests while the interview data were analyzed with a phenomenological approach. Overall, 84.7% of participants did not have transformative learning experiences while 15.3% of the participants had transformative learning experiences. As implied by the results of the statistical analysis of online survey, the participants who had the combination of an alphabetic language (English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Latin, Greek, or Korean (Hangul) as first language and an ideographic language (Chinese or Japanese) as target language were more likely to experience non-educational perspective transformation. Although the participants who had mentoring during enrollment reported experiencing non-educational-related perspective transformation, the participants who had self-reflection during enrollment reported experiencing educational-related perspective transformation. In the interviews, categories such as intrinsic motivation (genuine interests/passion), cultural exposure (active/authentic cultural participation, cultural comparison, travel experiences, movies, contact with native speakers), and personal connection with the target culture (make friends with native speakers, integrated identity) were emerged as factors that promoted a perspective transformation. This study demonstrated that (1a) cultural exposure and (1b) personal connection with the target culture promote (2) cultural comparison between self and others and (3) self-reflection/premise reflection, which eventually lead to a (4) perspective transformation.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/examination-factors-that-promote-transformative/docview/2779137821/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Amador, Laura",2014,Emotion and cognition in action: An ethnographic microanalysis of elderly language learners and their teacher,"This dissertation develops an empirical basis for the notion that entry points to cognition in adult second language (L2) learning are organized by emotional displays situated in real time learning. Specifically it examines the affective practices and forms of thinking that elderly participants use to manage and make sense of classroom events. As a case study of situated emotion and cognition among a group of elderly language learners and their teacher, this investigation provides a detailed ethnographic and talk-in-interaction analysis of classroom interaction and engagement with spoken and written foreign language Spanish. Several questions guide this qualitative investigation more generally. How is emotion situated in everyday classroom activities and when is it more prevalent? How do classmates and the teacher respond to affective displays? How do subjects manage communicative difficulty as opposed to triumphs, and what kind of meaning or understandings do they attribute to these events? What are possible neural substrates of the observed behavioral patterns and how might current brain research help us understand such interactive patterns? What implications do findings have for language practitioners and learners of different ages? In this study, ethnographic and conversation analytic methods are used to document classroom conduct as well as participant perspectives related to such conduct, with the goal of addressing the above questions. The project consists of seven months of fieldwork in an informal second language Spanish class at a community-based center for seniors in the greater Los Angeles area; the result of which is almost 30 hours of participant observation and video documenting everyday classroom interactions and 10 hours of audio recorded interviews. This dissertation has at its core, the idea that an important dimension of emotion is its dialogic quality and dependence on the social environment for meaning. Such qualities are visible and audible for example in social emotions such as affective stance, empathy and in behaviors such as laughter (Linell, 2009). First, it sheds light on activities and participation structures that are commonly invoked in the setting and explores the subjects' motives for learning another language. Second, it illustrates how multi-modal affective displays acquire their significance and function from interactive exchanges between peers in the classroom and from broader contexts including past experience. For example, laughter acquires variable function and meaning, but may play a central role in inviting affective involvement and directing particular attention to language use. How attention is affectively organized in language learning has implications for the accomplishment of communicative goals, and for the shaping of activities to fit needs and desires (Kramsch, 2009a). Next, this report reveals that affective displays play a central role in how activities are organized and in the learning environment that is established. This is important given that theoretically speaking, threats to self-image may generate perceptions that positively or negatively impact engagement or action tendencies in children and young adult learners of second languages (Schumann, 2001a, Schumann et al., 2004; Horwitz et al., 1986; Guiora, 1983). In this case, whether or not participants are vulnerable to image threat, and how they manage experiences is constrained by a complex intermix of variables. Finally, subjects are found to process experiences in ways that require the use of a broad knowledge base, invoking emotions that are relevant to their collective and individual purposes and needs. Selected research in neurobiology is used to develop one or two hypotheses about the neural substrates underlying the observed patterns of behavior. This report discusses how emotion is necessary for decision making in language learning and reveals how thinking may be dependent on one's stage of life and the learning situation one is more likely to encounter in such a stage. A range of social scientific, neurobiological and psychological literature is consulted throughout this dissertation with the goal of explaining findings and increasing our knowledge of a poorly studied age group. In all, this project sheds light on situated emotion in real time language learning (the good, the bad and the ugly), its variable role in smoothing interactions and its meaning potential across different contexts. Such a study of social interaction in the classroom has implications for our understanding of how emotion is situated in culturally specific ways through and for language learning across the life span and how affective displays are used tactically to achieve local and broad goals. It also has implications for language practitioners and learners looking to emphasize and use facilitative emotion (Dewaele, 2011; Pavlenko, 2005) and for those looking to understand how emotion awareness can be exploited as part of teaching and learning praxis (Kinginger, 2004; MacIntyre, 2002).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/emotion-cognition-action-ethnographic/docview/1496773300/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tanaka, Mitsuko",2014,The effects of affective variables and kanji growth on L1 Chinese JSL learners' kanji learning,"Learning kanji (i.e., the Chinese characters utilized in the Japanese writing system) is unique for learners of Japanese who speak Chinese as their first language (L1) due to their ability to transfer their knowledge of L1 hanzi (i.e., the Chinese characters utilized in the Chinese writing system). The present study is a longitudinal investigation into the effects of affective variables and kanji growth on kanji learning utilizing the self-determination theory (SDT; Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985, 2002). L1 Chinese learners of Japanese as a second language (L2) responded to a questionnaire designed to measure eleven affective variables and took kanji tests three times over one academic semester ( N = 229–340). In addition, interviews were conducted with 12 participants to further explore the affective variables influencing kanji learning. The data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate latent growth modeling, multiple regression analyses, and path modeling to answer six research questions. The results showed that: (a) there were no associations between the initial affective status and the initial kanji proficiency; (b) intrinsic motivation and introjected regulation exerted significant positive and negative influences on short-term kanji growth, respectively; (c) growth in kanji proficiency did not cultivate intrinsic motivation, nor did intrinsic motivation lead to growth in kanji proficiency; (d) perceived competence was significantly associated with both the initial status of intrinsic motivation and changes in intrinsic motivation; (e) perceived competence was not associated with either the initial level or the development of kanji proficiency; (f) perceived competence positively affected four variables, intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, external regulation, and mastery goals; (g) perceived autonomy led to lower amotivation and higher intrinsic motivation, but caused lower external regulation; (h) peers' positive influences positively affected all six variables, cultivating higher intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, introjected regulation, external regulation, and mastery goals, as well as causing lower amotivation; (i) peers' negative influences led to lower identified regulation and higher amotivation, and higher introjected regulation, and; (j) attitudes toward L2 community/speakers did not influence any of the SDT kanji learning motivation and mastery goals. The results of the interview study revealed that (a) the participants felt various types of enjoyment in kanji learning, including intrinsic motivation-knowledge, intrinsic motivation-stimulation, and intrinsic motivation-accomplishment; (b) ideal L2 self guided intrinsic motivation; (c) introjected regulation was channeled by ought-to L2 self and feared L2 self, and; (d) feared L2 self was uniquely formulated as a result of the complex interactions of various factors such as pride as L1 hanzi knowledge holders and normative pressure from Chinese peers. Evidence gathered in research targeting English learners is not necessarily applicable to the learning and motivation for learning other languages. The present study contributes to a better understanding of the universality as well as the individuality of the roles of motivation in L2 learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-affective-variables-kanji-growth-on-l1/docview/1502018275/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Gnintedem, Antoine",2014,First language proficiency and successful foreign language learning: The case of high school students learning French as a foreign language,"This study investigated whether there was a correlation between first language proficiency as measured by the Mississippi Curriculum Test (MCT II) Reading and Language Arts and foreign language proficiency as measured by the French Language Proficiency Test. Data for the independent variable, first language proficiency, was collected from the cumulative folders of 81 students enrolled in a French II class at a high school in central Mississippi. To obtain data for the dependent variable, foreign language proficiency, the French Language Proficiency Test was administered to the 81 participants who provided data for the independent variable. The Gamma Coefficient Test was used to calculate the strength and the direction of the correlation between first language proficiency and foreign language proficiency. The data analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between both variables in all the seven subgroups that made up the sample population. This led to the conclusion that first language proficiency alone does not guarantee successful learning of and proficiency in a foreign or second language. Other variables may have to be taken into consideration.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/first-language-proficiency-successful-foreign/docview/1522797842/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shima, Chiharu",2014,Language socialization process of Indonesian and Filipino nurses in Japan,"This ethnographic study focuses on the language socialization processes of six Indonesian and Filipino nurses working in Japan; these nurses came to Japan under the country's Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with Indonesia and the Philippines. After the establishment of the EPAs with the two countries, the first group of EPA nurses arrived in Japan from Indonesia and the Philippines in August 2008 and May 2009, respectively. Under the current system, EPA nurses are allowed to stay in Japan for a maximum of three years. However, for them to remain in Japan, they are required to pass the national board exam for nurses by the end of their third year. During their stay, they had to seek to pass the national board exam while working as nurse's aides. Thus, apart from needing assistance in adjusting to the workplace, which was provided by their engagement in actual healthcare support activities, they were also required to obtain exam-specific language skills. Drawing upon literature on the social nature of learning and identity, the impacts of tests, and foreign medical professionals' challenges in new environments, the study demonstrates how EPA nurses become socialized in a workplace context involving the negotiation of their identities, competencies, participation, and power relations in daily practices as determined by the EPA-based scheme and the macro social context of Japan. Data include observation and video or audio recordings of their interactions, interviews with the EPA nurses and their Japanese mentors and colleagues, as well as various artifacts collected from a year-long fieldwork in a hospital in Japan. Through a description of their engagement in different activities in the workplace, such as learning for the exam and working as a nursing assistant, this study illustrates the impacts of the exam on their learning, complex and multifaceted process of participation within a community of practice, and differences between official expectations and everyday requirements of language proficiency.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/language-socialization-process-indonesian/docview/1539530630/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Takeuchi, Miyuki",2014,Subject referential expressions and encoding of referential status in L2 narrative discourse by L1-English learners of Japanese,"This dissertation investigates the acquisition of subject referential expressions by L1-English learners of Japanese and classroom input as a possible contributor to non-target style usage among learners. The investigation utilizes a functional approach, examining how referential status is encoded through the use of subject referential forms: NP with a subject-marking particle ga, NP with a topic-marking particle wa, and null anaphora. Sixty-one learners, including university students in second, third, fourth-year Japanese classes and learners at advanced and high-advanced levels, as well as thirty-one native Japanese and English speakers, participated in the study. All performed two kinds of narrative tasks: storytelling of a picture book and film retell. Analyses of the narrative tasks indicate the following trends: (1) use of null anaphora for reference maintenance at early stages, (2) overuse of NP- wa at early stages, (3) delayed emergence of NP- ga to mark new information, and (4) overuse of NP- ga and persistent difficulty to acquire the functions of NP- wa among advanced and high-advanced learners. To examine the role of classroom input in the above trends, three Japanese textbooks were analyzed to ascertain to what degree and in what functions NP- ga , NP- wa , and null anaphora are used in the texts. The analysis shows that input of NP- ga is scarce compared to the other forms in the first-year textbook and explicit explanations of distinctions between ga and wa are lacking in the second and third-year textbooks. As a secondary source of classroom input, classroom discourse was analyzed, which found that NP- wa is more often used than other forms in teacher talk. These suggest that the overuse of NP-wa at early stages and delayed emergence of NP- ga found in the learners' narratives may be attributed to the input that they receive in classroom. Suggestions for improved pedagogy are presented at the end of the dissertation.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/subject-referential-expressions-encoding-status/docview/1545897572/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Boon, Erin Diane",2014,Heritage Welsh: a study of heritage language as the outcome of minority language acquisition and bilingualism,"This dissertation analyzes the language used by 20 adult heritage Welsh speakers now living in London, i.e., bilinguals who shifted to English dominance in childhood, and whose Welsh proficiencies now show divergences from baseline norms as a result of incomplete acquisition and attrition. The grammars of these heavily imbalanced bilinguals are compared with baseline informants (20 Welsh-dominant controls) on a narrative elicitation task, in which the informants tell the story of a children's wordless picture book ( Frog, Where Are You? by Mercer Mayer). The samples collected for this project (Appendix II.1) constitute the first corpus of heritage Welsh. Particular attention is paid to indicators of fluency (mean length of utterance, frequency of embedded clauses, speech rate, vocabulary recall delay, retraces, and retraces with correction), simplification in the system of initial consonant mutation, reanalysis of tense and aspect in verb construction, any non-native agreement morphology, and the availability of a null subject in the heritage Welsh samples. The heritage Welsh samples are examined for evidence that divergence in the heritage grammar results more from a trend toward simplification and access to Universal Grammar than influence from the speaker's dominant language, English. Part I investigates topics which are pertinent to the study of heritage language—its definition and connection to the Critical Period Hypothesis, the distinction between incomplete language acquisition and attrition, and theories of bilingual language systems. Part II details the analysis of the heritage Welsh samples in particular. The concluding remarks broaden the focus to the minority status of the baseline language in Wales, presenting the inevitability of heritage speakers there as well if childhood exposure to Welsh does not reach the critical level necessary for full native proficiency and if the language is not maintained in adulthood. This project introduces the terms ""heritage Welsh"" and ""heritage speaker"" into Welsh linguistics, and presents a framework with which to discuss this previously neglected category of bilinguals.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/heritage-welsh-study-language-as-outcome-minority/docview/1557741729/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kim, Jiyoung",2014,The imperfective aspect in Korean: A panchronic approach,"The Korean construction - ko iss - is traditionally referred to as a progressive aspect marker. However, due to the different aspectual classifications of verbs in Korean and the multiple uses of the - ko iss - construction, it is not easy to determine its grammatical properties. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Korean - ko iss - construction and its different aspectual meanings in discourse. Claiming that consideration of discourse contexts is necessary to account for the semantic and grammatical nature of the - ko iss - construction, I attempted to address the different views and solve the ongoing disagreements on the aspectual classification of verbs in Korean and the grammatical category of the - ko iss - construction. Based on the results of the study analyzing naturally occurring discourse data, I suggest that the basic meaning of - ko iss - underlying all its current variant uses is “continuous status at reference time,” which fits better with the continuous aspect than the progressive aspect. With the extended meaning of the habitual, the - ko iss - construction is categorized as a general imperfective. The multiple uses of the - ko iss - construction can be accounted for by taking a diachronic perspective; in other words, the grammaticalization of - ko iss - and the context-dependent nature of this construction can explain its multiple uses in Modern Korean. I investigated the historical development of the - ko iss - construction in order to find the answer to the question of why the - ko iss - construction should have the general meaning that it does, along with its various context-dependent interpretations. Based on empirical evidence and grammaticalization theory, I confirmed that the grammaticalization of - ko iss - is the major factor responsible for its multiple uses in Modern Korean. Finally, I empirically investigated how L2 learners acquire the Korean aspect marker - ko iss - with respect to verb type and analyzed L2 Korean textbooks used by the participants at the time of the study. Based on the results of the experimental study and the problems found in the L2 textbooks, I suggest more effective methods of teaching the aspectual meanings of - ko iss - in the L2 classroom.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/imperfective-aspect-korean-panchronic-approach/docview/1611733303/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Jackson, Daniel O.",2014,"The relative contribution of input modification, learner awareness, and individual differences to second language construction learning","This study adopts a constructionist approach to investigating three recent proposals grounded in cognitive perspectives on second language acquisition, which broaden the research agenda in the areas of input modification, learner awareness, and individual differences. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the following would support learning of artificial morphological constructions: (a) input modification in the form of partially repeated sequences, (b) awareness of precise form-meaning mappings, and (c) cognitive-affective learner differences. During the computerized training phase of the study, 90 English-dominant undergraduate participants were placed into three conditions: two experimental conditions exhibiting partial repetition similar to that found in caregiver discourse and a control condition exhibiting no such repetition. The testing phase utilized a picture-word matching task to assess participants’ ability to judge correct versus incorrect constructions based on trained and untrained subtest items. Learner awareness was gauged through source attributions and a retrospective written questionnaire. Measures of learner differences included working memory tasks (reading span and dual 3-back) and personality scales (openness and intellect). A test-retest study with 20 of the participants showed these individual difference measures to be relatively stable. Results indicated that the study’s hypotheses were largely supported. Learner awareness levels, reading span scores, and item type significantly predicted outcomes on the trained and untrained subtests of the picture-word matching task, based on a regression model including the random effects of items and participants. Also, a better fit to the data was achieved by using a fine-grained, rather than course-grained, system of coding awareness. However, contrary to hypothesis, participants in the experimental conditions did not significantly outperform those in the control condition on the picture-word matching task. Another finding of this study was that participants reported use of both explicit (rule, memory) and implicit (guess, intuition) knowledge sources on the picture-word matching task. In conclusion, this study offers additional evidence concerning the roles of awareness and individual differences in second language learning, suggests ways to enhance the internal validity of research in this domain, and potentially informs future research on input modification as a pedagogic technique.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/relative-contribution-input-modification-learner/docview/1613188345/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Alameen, Ghinwa",2014,The effectiveness of linking instruction on NNS speech perception and production,"Despite the prevalence of connected speech processes in spoken English and their importance for communication, there has been relatively little research on them in the field of second language learning. This study investigated the effectiveness of using two methods for teaching linking to NNSs of English. Audio-visual (AV) feedback, integrating both audio and electronic visual feedback, and audio-only (AO) feedback were employed in the development of online materials to help improve learners' perception and production of consonant-to-vowel linking such as 'give in' and vowel-to-vowel linking such as 'see it'. The long-term effectiveness of the instructional materials was also examined to see whether learners were able to retain improvement beyond the training period. In addition, the study explored whether improvement can transfer to novel contexts. The influence of high frequency and low frequency words on linking production was also investigated. Finally, students' perceptions of the use of AV and AO feedback were reported to guide future implementation of the materials. Forty-five learners of English participated in the study with 15 students in each of the two experimental groups and the control group. A pretest, posttest and delayed posttest design was implemented to answer the research questions of the study. Students' dictation of old and new sentences and their audio recordings of two read texts were analyzed. Qualitative data consisted of students' answers to a post-training questionnaire. Findings indicate that both types of training were effective in improving learners' perception and production of linking immediately and one month after training. Learners were also able to transfer the gained improvement to novel contexts. In addition, it was found that students' improvement of linking high frequency words was significantly greater than that of low frequency words, which were more difficult to link. The use of audio-visual training with waveforms resulted in better improvement in linking perception and production as well as more positive learner feedback than the audio-only training. The findings of the study hold a number of pedagogical implications for language teachers, material developers, and those interested in researching connected speech and the use of technology for language learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effectiveness-linking-instruction-on-nns-speech/docview/1621585779/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Wang, Jun",2014,Skit project in elementary Chinese classes with heritage students,"The skit project, which has been part of the Elementary Chinese curriculum, has advantages and disadvantages. Observations of students' preparations and surveys of students' opinions were conducted in order to test the effectiveness of the skit project. The survey results verify that the skit project was successful at motivating students and improving integrated skills. The observations indicate a transition of students' working strategies and a transition of heritage students' typical role from Chinese 101 to Chinese 102. These changes indicate that a smaller language proficiency gap within a group can improve students' level of cooperation. The pedagogical implications of this research are that teachers should provide students with rich contexts, provide language chunks that go beyond the textbook, and create cooperative learning environments in order to maximize the benefits of skit projects for language learners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/skit-project-elementary-chinese-classes-with/docview/1622471206/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lake, Julie B.",2014,The role of individual differences in L1 and L2 processing of bridging and predictive inferences,"Second language acquisition (SLA) and psycholinguistic researchers are interested in how inferences are processed in first language (L1) and second language (L2) reading to better understand how learners negotiate for meaning within a text. Preliminary evidence from brain-based studies suggests that bridging inferences (i.e., connecting pronouns and referents) may rely more heavily on short-term memory (STM) (Burkhardt, 2006) while predictive inferences (i.e., forecasting upcoming events from textual information) may rely more heavily on cognitive control (CC) (Jin et al., 2009). However, despite these advances, it is still not clear whether or not L2 readers have access to the necessary linguistic structures (Horiba, 1996) or, instead, if proficiency level is a confounding variable (Cohen, 1998; Guerrero, 2005; Leontiev, 1981). To address these gaps, an L1 English reading study and an L2 English reading study were carried out to explore whether or not inferences are processed differently than non-inferences, whether or not bridging and predictive inferences are processed differently from one another, and which cognitive resources are recruited during the processing of bridging and predictive inferences. The L1 and L2 data were compared to see if inference processing differs based on language background. L1 English speakers ( n = 50) and L2 English-L1 Spanish speakers ( n = 23) completed a cumulative self-paced reading task in a distraction paradigm; participants read scenarios that required them to make a bridging inference, a predictive inference or no inference with interference (while completing a secondary task that taxed STM or CC) or without interference. Independent measures of STM and CC were also collected to see whether these scores were associated with reading performance. The results indicated that L1 and proficient L2 readers process inferences similarly. Participants relied on CC for bridging and predictive inferences, supporting a multi-component framework of attentional control capacity (Barnes &amp; Jones, 2000). These results are consistent with research on individual difference in SLA (e.g., Dornyei &amp; Skehan, 2003), in that they suggest that CC may influence L2 classroom learning and account for the variation in L2 reading acquisition. Additionally, the findings have implications for L2 testing, as they pose a threat to the internal validity of standardized reading tests and ultimately the grade-level placement of L2 readers.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-individual-differences-l1-l2-processing/docview/1629825583/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Adelman, Allison Silver",2014,Conversations with Native Speakers: Acquiring Japanese as a Second Language,"Children acquire their L1 entirely through interactions with other speakers; in the same way, L2 learners benefit from participating in conversations with native speakers. I take a discourse-functional view of native speaker competence, assuming that positive evidence (language in use), comprising both frequency and contexts of usage, plays an important role in native speakers' mental representations and acquisition of grammar. If we assume that any comfortably proficient L2 speaker cannot have acquired that language ability solely from textbooks or classroom instruction, then the question arises: in what ways does conversation help language learners acquire a discourse-based grammar mirroring that of native speakers? I address this question across three case studies, using data from twelve conversations, each between one native speaker and one non-native speaker of Japanese. The first case study (Chapter 3) investigates the types of explicit and implicit interactional feedback (comprising negative as well as positive evidence) that native speakers provide in conversation with non-native speakers. I conduct a qualitative analysis of points in the conversation related to the non-native speaker's language ability, including instances of explicit metalinguistic discussion and of implicit feedback, such as recasts of non-native speaker utterances, and I suggest the ways in which these function as potential L2 learning mechanisms. In the other two case studies, I examine the question: To what extent do the conversational grammars of non-native speakers exhibit the same relationships between grammatical form and discourse function as the conversational grammars of native speakers? In Chapter 4, I conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of Noun-Modifying Constructions (NMCs) and compare the usage of NMCs among native vs. non-native speakers, based on discourse factors, finding that the non-native speakers, especially those with more experience living in Japan, produced NMCs with frequencies and distributions similar to those of the native speakers. In Chapter 5, a quantitative analysis of subject argument realization, I use a mixed-effects model to show that both native and non-native speakers' patterns of subject realization are influenced by discourse-pragmatic factors such as givenness and contrast, and that the patterns observed among non-native speakers mirror those in native speakers' speech. I propose that non-native speakers can only demonstrate such similar sensitivities to discourse-pragmatic factors if exposed to native-speaker-like frequencies of use in conversation. The findings of this case study allow for a glimpse into the impact of positive evidence from natural input on L2 learners' acquisition of discourse-based grammar.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/conversations-with-native-speakers-acquiring/docview/1638273016/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Morales, Alexandra",2014,Production and comprehension of verb agreement morphology in Spanish and English child L2 learners: Evidence for the effects of morphological structure,"Verbal inflections are problematic for both first language (L1) and second language (L2) learners in both comprehension and production and take a while to develop. Most research has mainly looked at this phenomenon from the perspective of functional features and has tried to ascertain whether or not learners have the grammatical knowledge or representation of the L2. However, although insightful, research has failed to look in greater detail at how the structure of the target-language may affect learners’ production and comprehension of verbal morphemes. In L1 acquisition, it has been found that the structure of the language may have an effect on children’s verbal morphology acquisition. However, it is basically unknown whether this is also true for L2 acquisition or, if in contrast, all child L2 learners show similar patterns of verbal morphology acquisition regardless of the L2. The present study addresses this issue and investigates whether child L2 learners learning typologically distinct languages show similar acquisition of verbal morphology. In order to address the study’s objectives, the acquisition of agreement morphology in school-age children learning Spanish and learning English as L2 was evaluated. Thirty two English-speaking children with ages ranging from 7;5 to 10;11 years (M = 8;9), were tested in the United States. All of these children were enrolled in an immersion program and had started learning Spanish when they were between 4 and 7 years old (M= 4.9). Additionally, 32 Spanish-speaking children, with ages ranging from 7;7 to 9;9 years (M= 9;0), were tested in Puerto Rico. All of these children were enrolled in an immersion program and had started learning English when they were between 4 and 5 years old (M=4.3). The results revealed that the children learning Spanish showed high accuracy in producing Spanish 3rd person plurals and performed native-like in comprehending verbal agreement. In contrast, the children learning English exhibited low accuracy in both the production and comprehension of verbal agreement (3rd person singular -s), and did not reach native-like performance in any of the tasks. These results suggest that there may be some parallelism between verbal morphology acquisition in L1 children and verbal morphology acquisition in child L2 learners. In both, the morphological structure of the language seems to play a role in the process of acquisition. The findings reported here for child L2 learners suggest that highly and regular inflected systems (e.g. Spanish) will be acquired at a faster rate than poorly and inconsistent inflected languages (e.g. English).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/production-comprehension-verb-agreement/docview/1639029567/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shigenaga, Yasumasa",2014,Processing and acquisition of scrambled sentences by learners of Japanese as a second language,"This three-article dissertation aimed at investigating how simple transitive sentences with a scrambled word order (i.e., Object-Subject-Verb) are processed and acquired by second language (L2) learners of Japanese. The first article (Chapter 2) examined L2 learners' grammatical knowledge and production performance of the OSV sentences through two tasks (fill-in-the-blank and picture description). The results indicated a positive relationship between the learners' general proficiency in Japanese and their knowledge/production performance of the OSV sentences, although there was a rather large individual difference within proficiency groups. It was also found that the difficulty in producing OSV sentences was mostly due to a lack of grammatical knowledge, but the relationship of grammatical knowledge and production performance interacted with the types of sentences (reversible and non-reversible). The second article (Chapter 3) examined the comprehension processes of OSV sentences. While the results of a pilot study (sentence correctness decision task) indicated that both the L2 learners and native speakers (NS) took longer to read and comprehend OSV sentences than SOV sentences, the results of a self-paced reading task suggested that the processing of OSV sentences by L2 learners might be quite different from that of NSs. The NS participants read more slowly at the second NP position when they read the OSV sentences. On the other hand, the L2 learners, regardless of their proficiency level, did not show such slowdowns. The third article (Chapter 4) examined whether a psycholinguistic task (syntactic persistence with picture description) might facilitate the production of scrambled sentences among L2 learners, for the purpose of exploring the possibility of using such a method as an instructional tool. While the main task, which used regular SOV/OSV sentences as primes, was not very effective in eliciting the production of OSV sentences, the follow-up task, which used questions in SOV/OSV orders as primes, observed a more positive effect of syntactic persistence. Based on the results, explicit instruction and practice on scrambling is suggested.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-acquisition-scrambled-sentences/docview/1641125390/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nakamura, Mutsuo",2014,Japanese and Brazilian female teachers' directive/compliance-gaining strategies: A language socialization perspective,"This is an ethnographic study of Japanese and Brazilian female teachers’ directive and compliance-gaining strategies. With a language socialization approach, this study aims at illustrating female teachers’ socializing practices performed in classrooms of one Japanese and one Brazilian elementary school, both located in Japan. First, it analyzes crosscultural differences in the use of directive speech acts performed by Japanese- and Brazilian Portuguese-speaking female teachers. Second, it sheds light on Japanese female teachers’ directive and compliance-gaining strategies practiced in first grade mainstream classrooms with special focus on the interactional routines of aisatsu (“formal greeting”) and happyoo (“formal presentation”). Third, it illustrates Japanese and Brazilian female teachers’ directive/compliance-gaining strategies performed in interaction with one non-conforming Brazilian pupil in the kokusai kyoshitsu (“international classroom”) of the elementary school under scrutiny. The results of the present study demonstrate cultural differences between Japan and South America in regards to their attitudes towards authority and norms of group behavior. Specifically, the study illustrates one quantitative difference between the Japanese and the Brazilian female teachers’ use of directive speech acts: Japanese teachers’ requests versus Brazilian teachers’ direct imperatives. Second, the study has discovered Japanese mainstream classroom teachers’ directive/compliance-gaining strategies of kogoto (“small scoldings”), nagging, praising, and complimenting. Third, this research shed light on one Brazilian female teacher’s use of direct imperatives and persuasive discourses in interaction with a non-conforming Brazilian pupil. In the end, the study provides recommendations for Japanese teachers who teach South American students in Japan and for researchers interested in elucidating issues of culture, power, socialization, and resistance by means of studying teacher-student interactions.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/japanese-brazilian-female-teachers-directive/docview/1646482241/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Yang, Jia",2014,Toward a Pedagogy of Conventional Expressions in Chinese Culture,"Conventional expressions refer to any expression with a stable form that is commonly repeated in the routinized social interactions of a given culture. Expressions, such as “how are you?” “Nice to meet you,” are examples of such repetitions in the context of “greetings” in American culture. Conventional expressions are easily recognizable to members of a given culture so that no special efforts are needed to interpret desired meanings. They are culture specific and are often utilized to help newcomers (or novices) and language learners to be socialized in the interactions of a particular culture. Considering the importance of conventional expressions in language learning, this dissertation reports on a written-discourse-completion production test and a multiple-choice recognition test that were conducted to investigate the development of American learners' recognition and production of conventional expressions in typical social routines in Chinese culture, such as greetings, refusals, apologies and displays of gratitude. Results show that the length of exposure to the target language environment enables students to recognize more conventional expressions, but it does not ensure the students' abilities to produce these expressions. Students' successful production of the target forms are more likely to be related to their uses of different study strategies. In the data, high-performing students use the strategy of “making a mental picture of a situation in which the expression is used” and the strategy of “connecting a new expression to an image or picture associated with the expression” more frequently than low performing students do. The adoption of these deep mental processing strategies enable high performing students to store and retrieve useful expressions better, and hence they are more likely to successfully produce and recognize conventional expressions. The obtained results suggest three developmental stages for students' ability to produce conventional expressions: recognizing the expression in context, distinguishing the communicative intention conveyed by a set of related expressions, and producing the expression automatically in typical contexts that evoke the target expression. This dissertation brings the CFL field's attention to the fact that even in ordinary talk, contemporary Chinese will often display their personal versatility and ingenuity by using a number of expressions drawn from the cultural tradition. Consequently, a foreigner's ability to understand and use conventional expressions is often considered by Chinese speakers to be an important indicator of acculturation and high-language proficiency. Training of students to recognize, to understand, and then to automatically use these expressions in typical social situations in Chinese culture can enable students to be effective communicators in Chinese, and thus shorten their time to achieving higher level of proficiency. Empirical studies from this dissertation also show that the training should not only provide ample opportunities of practice for students to perform the target expressions in context, but also provide the coaching of effective strategies for students to notice, to interpret and then to remember these expressions.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/toward-pedagogy-conventional-expressions-chinese/docview/1647128916/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Seo, Hyun-Kyoung",2014,On the interplay of syntactic and semantic knowledge in the sentence processing of English as a second language,"A body of research argues that the processing of a second language (L2) includes a reflex to parse, i.e. to syntactically analyze the L2 input in real time, even if L2 sentence processing seems shallow. Hence, at each step of processing, a semantically interpreted partial phrase structure is generated. This structure is in need of lexical licensing within a narrow window of opportunity. The incremental analysis of an input string in such grammar-based parsing can be simultaneously influenced by possible category specifications, their consequences in the semantic system, and language-specific information, all modulated by possibly under-routinized lexical access to the L2 lexicon. Thus, the dissertation experimentally investigated this model, seeking evidence for the claim that category-based computations interact with verb-specific information to produce processing loads and semantic misinterpretations. Misinterpretations are expected when category-based expectations and the lexical information of verbs are temporarily congruent, even though the resulting analysis is disavowed in the lexical licensing phase. Under-routinized lexical access limits the effect of such knowledge. Results from a series of experiments suggest these interactions. Distinct processing loads for unaccusative and unergative verbs as well as misinterpretations of unaccusative verbs are offered in support. These seemed further influenced by the grammatical possibilities in Korean. These effects in L2 acquisition constitute evidence of a parse involving UG-governed structure generation subject to licensing by an L1-derived interlanguage lexicon. The role of the Korean L1 was especially evident in post-hoc examinations of processing loads and detectable semantic echoes induced by individual lexical items in view of their counterparts in Korean.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/on-interplay-syntactic-semantic-knowledge/docview/1648682764/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Sakurai, Shogo",2014,Do bilinguals see the world differently?: The conceptual transfer of colors and motion events by Japanese children at an English immersion school,"This study explores how learning a second/foreign language may affect cognition by studying second and fifth grade Japanese-English bilingual children (n=10 respectively) on color and motion event cognitions vis-à-vis English-speaking monolingual counterparts (n=12 and n=10 respectively). There has been a resurgent interest in linguistic relativity in recent years, that is, the relationship between language and cognition. However, many of the extant studies focus on monolingual speakers and compare cross-linguistic differences. In the current study, the focus was placed on Japanese-English bilingual children whose language pair (i.e., Japanese and English) and ages (7-8 years and 10-11 years) have rarely been investigated. Moreover, this study ambitiously examined the degree of language effect on two qualitatively different cognitive domains, vis., colors and motion events. The results revealed certain tendencies vis-à-vis the relationship between language and cognition. First, color cognition is more susceptible to a second/foreign language effect than motion event cognition among the bilingual participants. Second, in each cognitive domain, linguistic-mediated tasks generated stronger language influence than non-linguistic tasks. Third, both first (i.e., Japanese) and second (i.e., English) language development affected the degree of language effect on cognition. Overall, this study supports both linguistic relativity and thinking-for-speaking hypotheses in terms of the extent that language affects color and motion event cognitions by employing both linguistic-mediated and non-linguistic tasks.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/do-bilinguals-see-world-differently-conceptual/docview/1648992139/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Chu, Wei",2014,<i>Wh</i>-existential words: A comparative study of English-Chinese and Korean-Chinese interlanguages,"This dissertation looks at native language (L1) influence on adult nonnative language (L2) lexical development, investigating, in particular, whether the syntactic and semantic properties underlying L1 words have effects on the acquisition of lexical equivalents in the L2. The investigation is motivated by the following crosslinguistic differences as instantiated in wh -words in Chinese, Korean and English with respect to the existential sense: In Chinese, wh -words (e.g., shenme ) can be used as existentials (i.e., ‘something/anything’) as well as interrogatives (i.e., ‘what’) (Cheng, 1991; Huang, 1982). Chinese wh -existentials are confined to syntactico-semantic environments denoting nonveridicality (e.g., negatives, yes/no questions, conditionals) (Giannakidou, 2011); in Korean, wh -existentials are free of these restrictions (Gil &amp; Marsden, 2013); and in English, wh -words can never function as existentials. A comparative Interlanguage study is conducted to examine wh -existentials in the L2 Chinese of adult L1-Korean and L1-English speakers. The exploration centers on two main predictions based on Sprouse’s (2006) Lexical Transfer Hypothesis: (i) In nonveridical constructions, lower proficiency L1-Korean L2 learners of Chinese will pattern like Chinese native speakers in allowing wh -existentials, whereas lower proficiency L1-English L2 learners will show inhibitions against them; (ii) in veridical constructions, lower proficiency L1-English L2 learners will perform like Chinese speakers in prohibiting nontarget wh -existentials, whereas lower proficiency L1-Korean L2 learners will be inclined to allow them. Intermediate and advanced L1-English and L1-Korean L2 learners of Chinese (English intermediate, n = 20; English advanced, n = 22; Korean intermediate, n = 21; Korean advanced, n = 20) and native speakers of Chinese ( n = 30) completed three experiments targeting the interpretations of shenme ‘THING’ in nonveridical negative sentences and veridical present progressive sentences (contextualized multiple-choice interpretation task), the existential use of shenme ‘THING’ and shui ‘PERSON’ in nonveridical negative sentences and veridical present progressive sentences (elicited production task), and the acceptability judgments of existential shui ‘PERSON’ in yes/no questions and conditionals (acceptability judgment task). The results of the three experiments generally support the Lexical Transfer Hypothesis, which suggests that a deep level of lexical transfer – transfer of the syntactic and semantic properties underlying L1 lexical items – indeed influences L2 lexical development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/i-wh-existential-words-comparative-study-english/docview/1651531357/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Furukawa, Gavin Ken",2014,The use of English as a local language resource for identity construction in Japanese television variety shows,"This dissertation examines the context of Japanese variety shows to analyze the ways that English is used for identity construction and how this relates to the idea of English as a local resource but still connected to the wider world. It also analyzes the ways that English is used as an entertainment resource for both variety programs and for the people who appear on these shows. Japanese variety shows are a site where tarento , entertainers that are marketed through their personality without belonging to single categories such as singer, actor, or dancer, are often ridiculed and humiliated for the purposes of entertainment. During this process, the tarento will often construct themselves and others through tactics of intersubjectivity that isolate individuals from the larger group using different dimensions of relation. This dissertation takes a Sociocultural Linguistics approach to the data allowing for the combination of multiple methods and traditions to gain a more holistic understanding of the connections between the English Language, Japanese media culture, and society. Drawing upon Bakhtin’s (1981) chronotopes, and Bateson’s (1972) notion of interpretive frames, I analyze the discourse of Japanese variety shows as a series of embedded frames of different places in space and time that are constructed through indirect indexical reference working together to create a single text. Utilizing data from focus groups and interviews as well as broadcast data this dissertation investigates the content of the text, audience reception and production aspects of Japanese television. I analyze the uses of English to construct images of intelligence and social cool as well as stupidity and unstylishness through indexical fields. The analysis reveals how socially positive and negative images are used as marketable resources and how intermediary level discourse in the form of screen text or telop can present itself as having institutional authority through use of typography. My findings reveal that English is used in a continuing cycle connecting the indexical fields of English to the program and the viewership. The findings also show that the educational context of learning English is never totally separated from its use in this medium.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/use-english-as-local-language-resource-identity/docview/1651539026/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Moody, Stephen J.",2014,Language and identity in the Japanese workplace,"This dissertation investigates the construction and utilization of ‘outsider’ identities in an intercultural workplace setting. The participants are American university students employed as summer interns in companies in Japan where the primary language spoken was Japanese. The data come from roughly 50 hours of audio recordings taken during observations of the daily work routines of six interns in four different locations, as well as supplemental field notes and interviews. This study takes an Interactional Sociolinguistics approach which ties macro-level structures to micro-level interaction by analyzing the use of contextualization cues which index sociocultural knowledge. This allows moment-to-moment discursive practice to be understood within various contextual frames in an investigation of ‘outsider’ identity in professional environments. The central questions of this study are twofold: 1) How are interns linguistically constructed as gaijin ‘foreigners’ by themselves and others and 2) In what ways is the notion of gaijin used in the accomplishment of goal-oriented social interaction. In answering these questions, the theoretical framework of this study draws from a social constructionist perspective of language and social identity. Identities are seen not as pre-existing monolithic entities but as objects which can be dynamically performed, negotiated, and transformed within interaction. Discursive work is a central tool in accomplishing such activities. The investigation focuses on identity work accomplished through the use of three particularly prominent contextualization cues: 1) names and other forms of reference 2) addressee honorifics and items associated with ideologies of politeness and 3) the use of English in an otherwise Japanese environment. This study has implications for sociolinguistic work on intercultural communication in which the notion of ‘identity’ has been fruitful for understanding how differences in sociocultural backgrounds lead to different interpretations of linguistic cues and cause misunderstanding. This study expands knowledge in this area by also considering how identities are used as a tool in the accomplishment of local activities. It finds that the embodiment of stereotypes can actually be effective for both challenging outsider positions as well as strengthen intercultural relationships by providing an opportunity for shared experience.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/language-identity-japanese-workplace/docview/1673159058/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zhang, Shulin",2024,The Mechanism of <em>Pro</em>-Drop: Quantifying the Discourse Support for <em>Pro</em>-Drop Across Languages Based on Statistical Models,"This dissertation delves into the phenomenon of pro -drop, where pro nouns can be grammatically omitted in certain languages. The research focuses on three key questions: (1) How does discourse coherence support pro -drop languages, and how can we quantify discourse coherence? (2) What is the order of importance among linguistic factors relevant to pro -drop? (3) If an AI model is trained to predict pro -drop based on language dependency structures, what factors are crucial cross-linguistically? These questions are addressed in three experiments. Experiment 1 quantifies verb usage continuity to compare character salience in pro -drop and non- pro -drop cases across CN, BP, and ES. Results indicate that pro -drop cases necessitate higher character salience in verb usage continuity, highlighting the role of discourse coherence. Differences exist among languages, with radical pro -drop languages demanding more coherence than partial pro -drop and consistent pro -drop languages. Experiment 2 employs Binomial Logistic Regression and Random Forests to model pro -drop based on syntactic, semantic, morphological, and logical features. Findings reveal the significance of character consistency between main-embedded and current-previous clauses in all languages (Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish). ES and BP exhibit richer verbal morphology, potentially contributing to a higher model fit than Chinese. Sentential discourse relation features, such as coordinate structures, encourage pro -drop in CN and ES. Experiment 3 employs Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to classify story characters using dependency structure graphs from CN, BP, and ES discourse material. Results align with key elements in pro noun resolution, highlighting the importance of subjects, main verbs, and objects. Language-specific importance emerges, with the marker ( e.g. '就'(jiu4, means ""just"")) and auxiliary ( e.g. '了'(le0, means ""already""), '着'(zhe0, means ""going on"")) crucial in CN, while determiner and case play vital roles in BP and ES.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/mechanism-em-pro-drop-quantifying-discourse/docview/3065469303/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kim, Jeungeun Claudia",2024,The Role of Individual Differences and Effect of Task Repetition With Written Corrective Feedback in L2 Writing Development,"Research on Task Based Language Teaching (TBLT), and learning has developed significantly in recent years. As a result of the popularity of TBLT, numerous studies in second language acquisition (SLA) have explored the effect of task repetition on L2 performance. However, while previous task repetition studies mainly focused on the effects of repeating the same task on the complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) of oral language production, limited research has examined the influence of different types of task repetition on learners’ written production. Moreover, although written corrective feedback has been extensively investigated in SLA, the synergy effect between task repetition and written corrective feedback in shaping the quality of individual writing task output has not received adequate attention. Notably, no study has yet compared the influence of two types of task repetition (identical repetition and procedural repetition), by providing two distinct types of feedback—direct feedback and metalinguistic feedback, on written production for upper-intermediate adult EFL learners. To address this research gap, the current study investigated the effect of task repetition and two types of feedback on the accuracy of students’ written task performance. Additionally, recognizing the growing importance of individual differences (ID) in SLA, this study investigated the role of individual differences constructs such as working memory capacity, L2 writing anxiety, and L2 writing motivation on L2 learners' written production. Additionally, the level of motivation and anxiety to complete learning tasks was identified as another important factor contributing to individual variation (Kormos &amp; Wilby, 2019). Task motivation is a complex construct influenced by various contingencies associated with multiple actional contexts, making it more intricate than a simple composite of general and state motivation (Dornyei, 2002, 2005). Therefore, beyond general L2 writing motivation and L2 anxiety, the study also examined task-specific anxiety and motivation, which are transitory, to determine whether their levels change over time during task performance. Eighty adult Korean EFL learners participated in four intact classes randomly assigned to four treatment groups: identical repetition + direct feedback, identical repetition + metalinguistic feedback, procedural repetition + direct feedback, and procedural repetition + metalinguistic feedback. A pretest and posttest were employed. The two identical repetition groups repeated the same writing procedure with the same picture description, while two procedural repetition groups repeated the same writing procedure with different picture descriptions. Two types of feedback (direct and metalinguistic) were provided for each task repetition condition. To measure learners’ writing development, overall accuracy and accuracy on three target structures (past tense, articles, and prepositions) were assessed. L2 writing motivation and L2 writing anxiety were measured before the treatment sessions began to explore learners’ general orientation of motivation and anxiety toward L2 writing learning. However, task motivation and task anxiety were measured after they performed writing tasks each week as outcome measurers to observe their patterns. Questionnaires were used for all these four constructs, Lastly, a reading span test (RSPAN) was used for the working memory test. Results from ANCOVA indicated that the procedural task repetition groups significantly outperformed the two identical task repetition groups in overall accuracy and past tense accuracy. Regarding the role of individual differences in working memory, motivation, and anxiety, multiple regressions revealed distinct results based on treatments under each group. For both procedural task repetitions, anxiety was a positive predictor, while working memory was a negative predictor. In contrast to the two procedural task repetitions, anxiety was a negative predictor for both identical task repetition groups. Lastly, two-way repeated measure ANOVA results showed distinct motivational patterns after writing between the two task repetition groups. The two procedural task repetition groups increased their motivation, whereas the two identical task repetition groups decreased task motivation over time. Nevertheless, repeating either content or procedures appeared to alleviate learners’ task-specific anxiety in writing tasks. The findings further our understanding of the language learners’ perceived motivational and emotional factors influenced by task implementation and instructional strategies in the language learning context. These findings provide valuable insights into L2 pedagogy.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-individual-differences-effect-task/docview/3064146742/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hirschi, Kevin R.",2024,"Mobile-assisted Pronunciation Training for Intelligibility, Comprehensibility, and Pragmatically Appropriate Prosody","Millions engage in learning a Second Language (L2) using their mobile devices with a wide range of success. Concomitantly, there exists a growing interest in research on the effects of mobile-assisted language learning and predictors of learner outcomes (e.g., Loewen et al., 2020; Sudina &amp; Plonsky, 2023). However, few of these apps and studies target L2 pronunciation, despite the association of mobile devices and oral communication. To this end, this dissertation study investigates the impact of Mobile-Assisted Pronunciation Training (MAPT) on English pronunciation skills through the lens of intelligibility and comprehensibility as well as its interplay with motivation and technology acceptance. A novel computationally driven instantaneous visual feedback system was developed along with an intelligibility/comprehensibility-centric 28-lesson course on high functional load vowel and consonant contrasts, lexical stress, rhythm, and features of discourse intonation. University-level L1 Spanish learners of English in Mexico ( N = 122) were asked to complete the course over three weeks which included a pre-, post-, and delayed posttest, along with individual difference questionnaires at each test. Linear and logistic mixed effects models of listening tests and speaking tasks rated by trained listener participants ( N = 30) indicated an improvement in intelligibility, comprehensibility, high functional load contrasts, and intonation signaling agreement. However, other suprasegmental features did not significantly improve. When interpreted with learner comments, these results suggest that stress and fluency features require more extensive and contextualized treatment. Taking a dynamic perspective on individual differences, the study also found that engagement in MAPT increased motivation, but extrinsic motivation is associated with less effort in MAPT. Social Influence to use MAPT became more important for finishing the course; but, along with Effort Expectancy, it was also associated with less participant effort. None of the individual difference subconstructs, however, were associated with learning outcomes as measured by an increase in comprehensibility scores. Taken together, these results support the use of mobile devices for enhancing L2 pronunciation for communication, confirm that a pedagogical approach that targets intelligibility and comprehensibility can be effective for L2 learners, and suggest that extrinsic motivation may hamper learner efforts in MAPT. Implications for theory, pedagogy, and technology are provided for educators, technology developers, and researchers interested in using mobile devices to promote spoken L2 communication skills.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/mobile-assisted-pronunciation-training/docview/3060245897/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zhang, Shijie",2022,The Acquisition and Use of Mandarin Relative Clauses by Monolingual and Bilingual Children and Adults,"Children have been found to understand and use relative clauses (RCs) at an early age. However, not all types of RCs are acquired at the same time, and are used with the same frequency (e.g., Diessel &amp; Tomasello, 2000, 2005). Using corpus-based and experimental methodologies, the three studies presented in this thesis investigate the acquisition and processing of different types of RCs in Mandarin, aiming to understand the mechanisms involved in the acquisition and processing of RC involving varying degrees of complexity. The first study (Chapter 3) presents a corpus analysis examining the naturalistic production of Mandarin RCs by Mandarin-speaking monolingual and heritage MandarinEnglish bilingual children (1;00-5;00). The results show that both monolingual and bilingual children produce more object RCs than subject RCs in Mandarin. This is because Mandarin object RCs resemble simple Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) sentences the children had previously acquired, and occur more frequently than subject RCs in their input. Compared to monolingual children, bilingual children produce more object RCs, suggesting that the acquisition of Mandarin RCs is not only facilitated by SVO transitives in Mandarin, but also SVO transitives in English. In contrast to the first study, the second study (Chapter 4) reports a subject RC advantage by looking at the comprehension of Mandarin subject and object RCs in heritage Mandarin-English bilingual children (4;00-10;11) and their vocabulary-matched monolingual peers (4;00-5;09). Using a character-sentence matching task, the results reveal that simple SVO transitives hinder children’s comprehension of Mandarin object RCs by misleading them to interpret the noun phrase occurring first as the head noun. Compared to monolingual children, bilingual children who are more English dominant make this type of error more frequently for Mandarin object RCs, suggesting that both English SVO transitives and language dominance contribute to cross-linguistic influence. However, unlike either the subject or object RC advantage shown in children, mixed results are found in the writing of adult Mandarin native speakers (L1) and advanced second language learners (L2) in the third study (Chapter 5). Using conditional inference trees and random forests, the results show that both adult Mandarin L1 and L2 speakers’ selection of subject and object RCs heavily depends on the discourse context that RCs are situated in. The first and second studies (Chapters 3 and 4) are novel in taking Mandarin RCs with omitted head nouns into account. In spontaneous speech (Chapter 3), the results indicate that monolingual and bilingual children as young as two can produce Mandarin RCs with omitted head nouns, and the omission of a head noun does not influence the subject-object asymmetry. Similarly, the absence of a head noun does not influence monolingual and bilingual children’s comprehension of Mandarin RCs (Chapter 4), suggesting that they are able to recover omitted head nouns from the context provided. In addition, the first and third studies (Chapters 3 and 5) also examine the matrixclause positions in which Mandarin RCs tend to occur. RCs that occur in the non-centreembedded matrix-clause position (e.g., The goat saw the horse [that hugged the pig] ) are expected to be easier to process than RCs in the centre-embedded matrix-clause position (e.g., The horse [that hugged the pig] saw the goat ), as they require lower working memory load (e.g., Gibson, 1998, 2000). Supporting this assumption, in adult Mandarin L1 and L2 speakers’ writing (Chapter 5), non-centre-embedded RCs occur more often than centreembedded RCs. Moreover, the longer the RCs, the higher the possibility they are placed in the non-centre-embedded matrix-clause position. However, in children’s spontaneous speech (Chapter 3), both monolingual and bilingual children do not show a tendency to prefer noncentre-embedded over centre-embedded RCs, which may relate to the short length of the RCs they produce. The shorter the RCs, the less memory load is needed to process centre-embedded RCs, and therefore the disadvantage of centre-embedded RCs may diminish. The three studies of this thesis present mixed findings regarding Mandarin RC processing, but consistently provide evidence to support the usage-based account. That is, the processing of RCs is shaped by an individual’s age and language experience, including input frequency, the related structures that have been acquired, language dominance and the discourse contexts that RCs tend to appear in.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-use-mandarin-relative-clauses/docview/2723856270/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Li, Ran",2022,Investigation of Language Impairment and Treatment-Induced Recovery Patterns between Verbs and Nouns in Mandarin-English Bilinguals with Aphasia,"Previous research examining lexical-retrieval difficulty in bilinguals with aphasia (BWA) has identified a verb-noun dissociation in naming in both first (L1) and second (L2) languages, i.e., a lower naming accuracy for verbs than nouns. Yet, the evidence is limited to typologically similar languages, and whether the same patterns of lexical impairment emerge in other linguistic contexts (i.e., discourse) is unclear. Lexical-retrieval difficulty has been commonly targeted in bilingual aphasia rehabilitation, but mainly focused on nouns. Whether similar patterns of treatment-induced language recovery emerge in both noun and verb treatment remains unclear. Studies implementing semantic-based treatment have shown robust treatment gains, but patterns of generalizations are inconsistent. Most evidence in bilingual aphasia rehabilitation has come from individuals speaking Indo-European languages. Given that the Chinese-speaking population is rapidly growing nationwide, future research needs to establish the evidence base for aphasia rehabilitation in this population. Hence, two studies were undertaken in this dissertation work to address these critical issues. In Study 1, twelve Mandarin-English BWA were administered a battery of standardized naming and discourse tasks in both languages. A verb-noun dissociation was found across languages in single-word naming and discourse production. The magnitude of this verb-noun dissociation was similar in L1 and L2 in naming but was significantly larger in L2 than in L1 in discourse, depending on the specific task. Findings indicated a direct relationship between naming and lexical retrieval in discourse irrespective of the target language. In Study 2, the same group of Mandarin-English BWA underwent semantic-based treatment targeting noun and verb retrieval. These participants demonstrated improvement on the overall aphasia severity and lexical retrieval based on their performance on the standardized language assessments. Results from weekly naming probes showed a positive treatment gain in both noun and verb treatment, but to a greater extent in verb treatment. Generalization to semantically-related items was captured in noun treatment. Cross-language generalization was identified in both treatments, but to a larger extent when training verbs. Additionally, widespread generalizations beyond the single-word level and to untrained naming tasks were found following both noun and verb treatment. However, more generalizations were captured after noun treatment, particularly in discourse and untrained naming tasks. These two studies provided strong evidence of bilingual language impairment and treatment-induced language recovery between nouns and verbs in Mandarin-English BWA. The general discussion reviews key findings from Studies 1 and 2 and discusses clinical implications for studying bilingual aphasia recovery and language rehabilitation in future work.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigation-language-impairment-treatment/docview/2720372087/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Demsey, Laura A",2022,"Contact, Shift, and Structural Change in Franco-American New England","In the New England region of the United States, there exist large communities of French speakers, almost all of whom are descendants of immigrants who came from Quebec between about 1840 and 1910 to work in the new mills and factories. This migration from Quebec caused tension between the Anglo-Saxon Americans and the Franco-Americans; Franco-Americans were marginalized, and their language was all but eradicated in public life. Today, a lack of intergenerational transmission, along with influence from the dominant language of English, has caused linguistic change in the French of New England. Due to bilingualism with English and its minority status, New England French (NEF) has the potential for extensive contact-induced influence from English, which may be seen in its grammar. The structures explored in this study all include a basic grammatical element—the definite determiner—to examine a microcosm of the larger system. This study investigates English influence in four phenomena that include definite determiner produced by native speakers of French in two New England speech communities: Lewiston, Maine and Manchester, New Hampshire. I predicted that NEF speakers may exhibit influence from English in specific ways: omitting articles with place names (e.g., “Étaient dans New Brunswick, then”) and with generic and abstract nouns (e.g., “∅ patience est une vertu”), using English word choice and order with body parts (e.g., “J’ai brossé mes dents”) and in post-nominal adjective superlative constructions (e.g., “le plus intelligent étudiant dans la classe”), etc. I also hypothesized that age and exposure to and use of French are two main factors that correlate with higher rates of English-like structures. Results show evidence of the predicted kinds of influence from English and suggest that those with the least exposure to and the most contextually limited use of French produce English-like structures most frequently.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/contact-shift-structural-change-franco-american/docview/2720365877/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"DiBartolomeo, Megan Rita",2022,Moving beyond <em>lo siento</em>: The Effect of Pragmatic Instruction on the Production and Perception of Apologies in L2 Spanish,"An apology is an action or utterance that is meant to set things right after a speaker has violated a social norm (Searle, 1969). The words, phrases, and grammatical structures used in the formation of apologies vary by language and culture (Olshtain &amp; Cohen, 1983). Research shows that second language (L2) learners do not approximate native-like norms when making apologies in Spanish (Chodorowska-Pilch, 2019). There is a dearth of research on the instruction of L2 Spanish apologies in a classroom context, although the pragmatic development of apologies has been analyzed in study abroad (e.g., Hernández, 2018) and computer-mediated (e.g., Sykes, 2013) contexts. This dissertation contributes to the growing literature on L2 Spanish apologies in an underexplored learning environment. Instruction is known to facilitate L2 pragmatic development (Rose &amp; Kasper, 2001). The focus of research in instructional pragmatics is limited to comparisons of explicit and implicit instruction as a binary construct (e.g., Nguyen, Pham, &amp; Pham, 2012). Recent work (Taguchi, 2015) calls for a new focus on specific instructional features rather than the traditional dichotomy, which would allow researchers to gain insight into the nuances of instruction that are most beneficial for pragmatic development. This dissertation explores how three instructional features differentially influence learners’ perception and production of apologies in Spanish. Three experimental groups (metapragmatic instruction, consciousness-raising instruction, input enhancement) were compared with a control group and a group of native speakers in a pre-, post-, delayed post-test design. The instructional treatment for each experimental group consisted of a 50-minute lesson on Spanish apologies. Pragmatic development was measured using a role-play task and a pragmatic judgment task. Results showed that all three instructional features facilitated pragmatic development. A sequential analysis of role plays, a learner dyads questionnaire, and a study perceptions questionnaire shed light on learner and native speaker interaction and perceptions related to teaching and learning pragmatics. This dissertation corroborated previous research on pragmatics instruction and increased our knowledge of how different instructional features affect pragmatic development. Its innovative methodology provides a model for future research in instructional pragmatics, and it has implications for the classroom instruction of speech acts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/moving-beyond-em-lo-siento-effect-pragmatic/docview/2689112768/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Han, Lu",2022,Assessing L2 Chinese Listening Using Authenticated Spoken Texts,"This dissertation study explored the feasibility of using authenticated spoken texts to test L2 Chinese listening comprehension. The spoken texts used in the study were created using an “authenticating” technique, in which scripted spoken Chinese texts were infused with characteristics of real-world, unscripted spoken Chinese. In the first part of the study, 101 “naïve” L1 Chinese speakers reported their attitudes toward various characteristics of the scripted spoken texts and the authenticated spoken texts in a survey questionnaire. Comparisons of the L1 Chinese participants’ attitudes showed that they believed that the authenticated spoken texts were more authentic-sounding than the scripted texts in every measure. This indicates that the authenticity of scripted spoken texts normally used in L2 listening tests can be enhanced by using the text authentication technique. In the second part of the study, L2 listeners’ test performance and listening and test-taking processes during the post-test were examined. For the quantitative data, 184 intermediate and advanced adult L2 Chinese learners completed two listening tests (one pre-test assessing their listening proficiency and one post-test) and questionnaires tapping into their use of listening strategies and test-taking strategies. For the qualitative data, stimulated verbal recalls and verbal reports were employed to elicit another 16 L2 listeners’ verbalizations of their listening and test-taking processes. The comparison of the test scores showed that the listening test using authenticated spoken text as listening input was significantly more difficult than the same test using scripted spoken texts. The comparisons of the questionnaire results showed that the test-takers did not differ in their use of listening strategies and test-taking strategies. Aligned with the quantitative results, the verbal recalls showed that the two groups, despite hearing spoken texts with different degrees of scriptedness, did not adjust their use of listening strategies and test-taking strategies. However, the authenticated spoken texts elicited a greater reliance on lower-level processes compared to the scripted spoken texts. The last part of the study involving the same 16 L2 qualitative participants investigated text-related sources of bottom-up listening difficulties of the two experimental groups through a series of diagnostic listening procedures using L2 oral and written (typing) repetition tasks. It was found that, first, compared to the scripted group, the authenticated group had more phonological decoding difficulties due to connected speech; second, even though the authenticated group had more word segmentation difficulties, this type of listening difficulty seemed to be less severe for both groups compared to the difficulty of phonological decoding; and third, other features commonly found in unscripted spoken Chinese such as filled pauses and false starts did not seem to greatly impede participants’ bottom-up listening processes. The results from the three parts of the study and my experience creating authenticated spoken texts suggest that L2 Chinese test developers should include at least some authenticated spoken texts in their listening tests, because (a) they are more “authentic-sounding”; (b) high-proficiency L2 listeners with extensive Chinese second language learning experiences find them harder to comprehend than scripted texts; and (c) they elicit cognitive processes that better represent the processes in real-world listening. Additional practical and theoretical implications pertinent to test development and L2 Chinese listening instruction are also provided.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/assessing-l2-chinese-listening-using/docview/2668183646/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lee, Giseung",2022,Postsecondary L2 Korean Learners’ Knowledge and Perceptions of Interlanguage Pragmatics,"By adopting qualitative research, this dissertation examines the under-explored area of second language (L2) Korean learners’ knowledge and perceptions of interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) by analyzing their narrated academic experiences so that students’ perceptions of ILP could help improve current ILP instruction in novice L2 Korean courses. Scholars in the field of second language acquisition have acknowledged the importance of ILP starting since the 1990s (Bachman, 1990; Bachman &amp; Palmer, 1996; Canale &amp; Swain, 1980; Kasper, 1992). For example, how L2 Korean learners' learning processes such as L2 comprehension and speech are influenced by their first language (L1). As a result, the research direction has shifted from disseminating significance of ILP to its teachability and pedagogical efficacy (Ishihara 2009; Kasper &amp; Youn, 2018; Ohta, 2005; Taguchi, 2016; Vandergrift, 2003). Furthermore, ongoing arguments on the efficacy of pragmatic instruction in the last two decades have revolved around whether methods of explicit or implicit pedagogy are more effective in instilling ILP to L2 learners (Halenko &amp; Jones, 2011; Kasper &amp; Roever, 2005; Li, 2012). Particularly, L2 instructors argue that role play is one of the most effective methods for enhancing and assessing students’ pragmatic competencies. Adopting role play in L2 Korean classrooms is an exemplary method of implicit pedagogy for ILP as the role play situations are fairly close to the real-world ones. However, all of the aforementioned studies focus on instructors’ perceptions regarding L2 pedagogical implications. There are a few studies about perceptions of ILP for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and English as a Second Language (ESL) learners but studies are considerably scarce in regards to L2 Korean learners, especially lacking qualitative data from L2 Korean students’ perceptions such as how they view and what they currently understand about ILP. Thus, due to a lack of studies on L2 Korean learners’ perceptions and knowledge of ILP, this study further explores the pedagogical effectiveness of ILP within L2 Korean instruction through incorporating narrated academic experiences of ILP from the L2 learners. Although this study centers on L2 Korean pedagogy, the findings could be applied to other world languages as well.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/postsecondary-l2-korean-learners-knowledge/docview/2661886993/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Suzuki, Shungo",2021,"The Multidimensionality of Second Language Oral Fluency: The Interface Between Cognitive, Utterance, and Perceived Fluency","In the context of the learning, teaching, and assessment of second language (L2) speaking skills, L2 fluency has been regarded as one of the important constructs. However, L2 fluency research has witnessed a long debate over the definition and measurements of L2 oral fluency; scholars have interchangeably used the term, “fluency”, with different connotations, such as speakers’ ability, speech features, and listeners’ perception. In order to distinguish different conceptualizations of fluency, Segalowitz (2010) proposed three subconstructs of fluency: utterance fluency (i.e., observable temporal features of speech), cognitive fluency (i.e., speaker’s ability to manipulate L2 knowledge efficiently), and perceived fluency (i.e., listener’s subjective judgements of fluency). However, it is still unclear how these three subconstructs of L2 fluency are interrelated with each other. The overarching goal of the thesis is to examine the construct of L2 oral fluency, particularly focusing on the interrelationship between cognitive, utterance, and perceived fluency. To this end, this thesis consists of four separate studies. Study 1 took a meta-analytic approach to synthesizing previous findings on the relationship between perceived and utterance fluency. Study 2 compared utterance fluency performance across speaking tasks which were designed to differ in the quality of speech processing demands, operationalized by task design features (i.e., task effects). Study 3 examined the contribution of cognitive fluency to utterance fluency, taking a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach. The study also analysed the stability of the factor structure of utterance fluency (Tavakoli &amp; Skehan, 2005)—speed, breakdown, and repair fluency—and cognitive fluency across speaking tasks. Finally, Study 4 investigated the extent to which L2 utterance fluency can be predicted from L1 utterance fluency with regard to the moderator effects of L2 proficiency on the L1-L2 utterance fluency link. Study 1 collected 263 effect sizes from 22 studies reporting the correlation coefficients between listener-based judgements of fluency and objective measures of temporal features ( N = 335–746). Among the pooled utterance fluency measures, Study 1 selected the common measures from four different categories: speed (articulation rate), breakdown (silent pause frequency, silent pause duration), repair (disfluency rate), and composite fluency (mean length of run, speech rate). Methodological moderator variables were selected with respect to the major phases of research into the utterance-perceived fluency link: Speech stimulus preparation (e.g., task type, target L2), Rater background (e.g., L1 vs. L2 listeners), Perceived fluency rating procedure (Definition of fluency, the number of point scales), and Utterance fluency measure calculation (length of pauses, manual vs. automated annotation). Studies 2–4 were conducted using the same dataset which included a set of cognitive and utterance fluency measures from Japanese-speaking learners of English ( N = 128). Using a range of psycholinguistic tests, cognitive fluency was assessed in terms of linguistic resources and processing speed at different linguistic levels: vocabulary (vocabulary size, lexical retrieval speed), grammar (sentence construction speed and accuracy, grammaticality judgement speed and accuracy), and pronunciation (articulatory speed). In order to measure utterance fluency, speech data were elicited via four speaking tasks which differed in the quality of speech processing demands: argumentative task, picture narrative task, and text retelling tasks with/without read-aloud assistance.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/multidimensionality-second-language-oral-fluency/docview/2838438923/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Baladzhaeva, Liubov;הביי'גדלב, בובויל",2021,Lexical Attrition in First and Second Languages: A Case of Russian Speaking Immigrants in Israel,"Language attrition of first (L1) and second (L2) languages has been a prominent area of applied linguistic research recently, particularly with the increase in international migration. Few studies, however, examined simultaneous L1 and L2 attrition in the same population. A further understudied area is indirect (second-hand) attrition – L1 or L2 attrition in immigrants who have not learned the language of the new country and yet experience its influence in the languages they know. This study investigates lexical L1 and L2 attrition in L1 Russian-speaking immigrants in Israel and the effect of the interplay of Russian, English, and Hebrew languages on this attrition. Furthermore, the study aims to expand the knowledge of second-hand L1 and L2 attrition. It also examines how attrition is affected by L2/L3 level, L1/L2/L3 usage, language aptitude, education, and metalinguistic awareness. The study employed a quantitative methodology. The participants included four study groups in Israel (monolingual L1 Russian speakers, bilingual L1 Russian – L2 Hebrew speakers, bilingual L1 Russian – L2 English, and trilingual L1Russian – L2 English – L3 Hebrew speakers) and two control groups residing in Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan (monolingual L1 Russian speakers, bilingual L1 Russian – L2 English speakers). The participants took a number of tests that examined lexical attrition of L1 Russian and (for English speakers) L2 English in the following areas: collocations, infrequent vocabulary, vocabulary size, perceived word similarity, and object categorization patterns. Additionally, the participants completed sociolinguistic questionnaires and took tests of language aptitude and metalinguistic awareness. The tests were administered online. Results provided evidence for direct and second-hand L1 attrition of Russian, especially of collocations, under the influence of Hebrew. L2 English did not appear to have a significant effect on L1. L2 attrition of English was less prominent, but Hebrew appeared to affect L2 English, especially in the area of collocations. Higher levels of language aptitude, metalinguistic awareness, and education served as protective factors against attrition. Length of residence in the new country was shown to be an important factor for L1 and L2 attrition. Frequent use of Russian did not diminish L1 attrition, possibly because immigrants were exposed to attrited, or heritage Russian to a large extent in their daily lives. Frequent use of English, on the other hand, was associated with lower levels of L2 English attrition possibly because of the nature of the immigrants’ input in English that is largely from media produced in English-speaking countries and not in Israel. The specific contributions of the study to the field of language attrition are in describing and explaining attrition in multilingual speakers and second-hand attrition.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/lexical-attrition-first-second-languages-case/docview/2787194714/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Nguyen, Huong Thi Thu",2021,The Effects of Event Depictions in Second Language Phrasal Vocabulary Learning,"In früheren Studien zum L2-Wortschatzerwerb wurden die Auswirkungen des visuellen Kontexts auf das Lernen und die Verarbeitung von Wörtern und Kollokationen in der L2 untersucht. Es wurde festgestellt, dass die Erstsprache einen positiven Transfer auf das Lernen einer Zweitsprache hat, wenn die Wörter Ähnlichkeiten aufweisen. Darüber hinaus wurden die Einflüsse der kognitiven Fähigkeiten der Lernenden und ihres Erwerbsalters (AoA) auf das L2-Vokabellernen unter verschiedenen Bedingungen des L2-Vokabellernens festgestellt. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, die Auswirkungen des visuellen Kontexts und des Transfers auf das Lernen von L2-Vokabeln weiter zu untersuchen und zu klären, wie die kognitiven Fähigkeiten und das Erwerbsalter diese Auswirkungen in einem bestimmten L2-Lernkontext beeinflussen. Im Detail wurden Effekte der Ereignisdarstellung (d.h. nicht-sprachlicher visueller Kontext) untersucht sowie Transfereffekte aus der Erstsprache in die Zweitsprache im Bezug auf das Lernen von L2-Phrasenwortschatz (d.h. Verb-Nomen-Phrasen) bei erwachsenen Anfängern. Wir führten Kurzzeitexperimente zum L2-Wortschatzerwerb durch, bei denen wir die Reaktionszeiten maßen. Zwei weitere Forschungsfragen untersuchten, ob es Zusammenhänge zwischen der AoA oder den kognitiven Fähigkeiten der Lernenden und ihrem Lernerfolg beim Vokabellernen in einer kurzfristigen L2-Lernumgebung gibt. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass erwachsene L2-Anfänger*innen beim L2-Vokabellernen von visuellen Darstellungen profitierten: Sie waren unter Lernbedingungen mit Ereignissen genauer und schneller als unter Lernbedingungen ohne Ereignisse. Diese Effekte konnten in drei Experimenten nicht nur mit jungen Erwachsenen im Alter von 18 bis 31 Jahren nachgewiesen werden, sondern galten auch für Erwachsene im frühen und späten mittleren Alter von 32 bis 65 Jahren. Die vorangegangene Forschung deutete darauf hin, dass die Ähnlichkeit zwischen L1 und L2 das L2-Lernen beeinflussen könnte, jedoch nicht in diesem spezifischen L2-Lernkontext. Darüber hinaus wurde der AoA der Probanden manipuliert, was dazu führte, dass junge Erwachsene in den kognitiven Tests und bei den L2-Lernaufgaben besser abschnitten als die anderen beiden Gruppen. Basierend auf den Ergebnissen unserer Forschung konnten wir herausfinden, welche Faktoren den Erfolg des L2-Wortschatzerwerbs bei erwachsenen L2-Anfängern stark beeinflussen und dass das Lernen von L2-Phrasenwortschatz mit dargestellten Ereignisfotos angewendet werden kann.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-event-depictions-second-language-phrasal/docview/2700375944/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Calo, Stephanie",2021,Improving the Pronunciation of English Language Learners,"The dissertation explored the effectiveness of perceptual training with English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), for both the perception and production of three problematic vowel contrasts, /æ/-/ɛ/, /ɪ/-/ɛ/, /ɪ/-/i/. The methodology for the proposed study is based on that of Thorin et al. (2018), which conducted a perception experiment in a laboratory setting. The main goal of the dissertation was to provide a bridge between what has been successful in laboratory settings and what could realistically be offered in a more traditional classroom setting. The study compared three groups: Treatment 1 received a weekly 15-minute pronunciation lesson and a 10-minute perceptual training session for six weeks, Treatment 2 received a weekly 25-minute pronunciation lesson for six weeks, and the control group and did not receive any instruction. There were two main forms of assessment utilized throughout the study: identification tasks and recordings. The identification tasks assessed students’ ability to perceive different vowel sounds. The recordings were used to assess students’ gains in production. Praat, a computer software package for speech analysis, was used to obtain the formant measures of the pre- and post-test production data. The results showed that Treatment 1 led to the improvement and retention of participants’ perception of the three vowel contrasts. However, neither treatment group showed retained improvement in vowel production over the course of the semester. Therefore, it can be concluded that six weekly sessions of training focused on three vowel contrasts may facilitate long-term gains in perception, but not in production. Learners may require exposure to longer and more intense training sessions, which may not be possible to replicate in a typical classroom. Therefore, more research needs to be conducted to find treatment that is not only effective but could realistically be completed in a classroom.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/improving-pronunciation-english-language-learners/docview/2678814182/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Woods, Haruka",2021,L2 Acquisition of Interface Properties: Case of Japanese <i>Wa</i> and <i>Ga</i>,"This study investigates the second language (L2) acquisition of interface properties, with special focus on the Japanese particles wa and ga . The choice between wa and ga , which are often referred to as 'topic marker' and 'nominative case marker' respectively, is under influence of semantic (e.g. Noda 1996, Masuoka 1987) and discourse (e.g. Kuno 1975) information; in other words, it is a multiple-interface property (Montrul 2011). Based on the vulnerability in L2 acquisition of interface properties reported in previous studies (e.g. Sorace 2005), it is predicted that the difficulty in the L2 acquisition of wa and ga also stems from its characteristics as an interface property. It has also been argued that interface properties can cause residual difficulties at the near-native level and might not be fully acquirable by L2 speakers, i.e. Interface Hypothesis (Sorace and Filiaci 2006). However, in previous studies on L2 acquisition of wa and ga , the affecting factors on the choice between these particles have been mainly examined individually and not enough attention has been paid to the potential interactions between these factors. Therefore, how multiple-level factors affect Japanese L2 learners' choice between wa and ga remains a mystery. In order to uncover this mystery, the current study investigates the effect of various factors and their interactions on Japanese L2 learners' use of wa and ga . In this study, 134 L1 English / L2 Japanese speakers with beginner, intermediate, advanced and upper-advanced proficiency levels and 36 Japanese native speakers participated in an online cloze test. These participants were instructed to choose either wa or ga to mark a nominative NP in experimental sentences that were under various semantic and discourse conditions. The collected data was analysed statistically using binomial logistic regression. The results show significant interactions between a discourse factor on one hand and semantic factors on the other in L2 grammar, which means that the effect of discourse on the choice between wa and ga varies depending on the semantic characteristics of the sentence. The results of the follow-up interviews, which were conducted with 10 participants with various proficiency levels, also support these statistical results. Further, the results indicate that the difference between native and non-native speakers is mainly caused by non-native speakers' lower ability to reflect discourse information onto the choice of particle, which results in higher susceptibility to semantic factors. Finally, the results show that there is a significant gap between native speakers and upper-advanced speakers in their ability to process large amount of discourse information, providing supporting evidence to the Interface Hypothesis.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-acquisition-interface-properties-case-japanese/docview/2665127330/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Rehman, Ivana",2021,Real-Time Formant Extraction for Second Language Vowel Production Training,"Research advances in Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) have made way for the development of Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) software which offer extra learning time and material, specific feedback on individual errors, and the possibility for self-paced practice in a private and stress-free environment. With these advantages, CAPT systems can help address many of the issues a traditional language learning classroom faces when it comes to pronunciation instruction, such as the lack of trained teachers, teachers’ inability to provide instantaneous and/or individualized feedback due to class sizes, limited audio input, etc. However, there is a need for novel approaches to CAPT due to its limitless possibilities for learning, some of which are yet to be explored. This dissertation project includes a set of studies that examine the use of visual feedback in CAPT. Specifically, the project describes the development, testing, and implementation of a CAPT tool called Vowel Viewer. This tool visualizes a user’s vowel production in real time on an acoustic vowel chart while providing native speakers model production. The first study was aimed at exploring learners’ (n = 9) opinions on using this type of visual feedback in their pronunciation learning. The findings showed an overall positive attitude with an emphasis of the usefulness of the feedback for raising awareness of pronunciation errors. These findings were then used to inform the initial development of Vowel Viewer. This version of the program was subjected to a technical evaluation to ensure its accuracy in the acoustic feature extraction. The results of this evaluation showed high reliability (ICC &gt; 0.9) of Vowel Viewer when compared to the acclaimed software for acoustic analysis, Praat. Then, a user study was conducted, in which both learners (n =5) and language experts (n = 5) provided valuable data to inform further modification and testing of Vowel Viewer. The learners provided both quantitative data to track vowel production improvement in a pre-/post-test design and qualitative data to express their user experience. Although the quantitative data did not show significant changes from pre- to post-test due to the low sample size, the data was used to test multiple statistical models to apply to final testing. The qualitative data was used to update Vowel Viewer to reflect user feedback. The experiment also informed future development of the tool by attesting to its functionality. As a final inquiry, a pronunciation training study was administered in order to determine the effectiveness of the final version of Vowel Viewer on vowel production improvement of L2 learners. The training study included the visual feedback group (n=11) and the control group (n=8), and they both participated in a three-week (nine-session) training procedure. The results showed significant improvement in vowel acoustic accuracy in trained and new items for the experimental group. Some improvement in vowel intelligibility was also observed. The findings of this dissertation add to the research in CALL, in general, and specifically CAPT. The dissertation project expands the current body of research on visual feedback. It also harnesses the use of technology to accomplish something otherwise impossible, i.e., visualizing one’s vowel production, which advances language learning practices. The type of feedback explored in this dissertation is individualized and independent of the language background, so language instructors are informed about a potentially successful concept to introduce into their classrooms. Vowel plots can be used not only as feedback in learning, but as a progress report, as they allow improvement tracking over time. The overarching ambition behind this dissertation project was to develop a useful and practical CAPT tool to facilitate pronunciation learning both in and out of the classroom and to promote further research on this topic while bridging the gap between research and practice.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/real-time-formant-extraction-second-language/docview/2625011184/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"King, Levi",2021,Semantic Analysis of Image-Based Learner Sentences,"An intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL) system is an application to provide users instruction and practice as they learn a second language. In order to be more effective and more widely adopted, ICALL must better align with second language acquisition (SLA) research, moving away from menu-based or fill-in-the-blank exercises and toward the task-based and communicative methods the research supports. As a first step in this direction, this dissertation presents a mechanism by which an ICALL system can judge the appropriateness of an advanced English learner’s response to an image-based prompt simply by comparison with a collection of crowdsourced native speaker (NS) responses. It relies on well-established natural language processing (NLP) techniques, namely syntactic dependency parsing, lemmatization and term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf). To ensure broader success, this method was designed to be flexible, expandable and low-cost by relying on readily available tools and using crowd- sourced models instead of custom rules or expert knowledge. Compared to more advanced machine learning NLP approaches, my system maintains a high degree of transparency, making it ideal for integration with an ICALL feedback module. To evaluate my approach, I collected a corpus of over 13,000 picture description task (PDT) responses from NSs and English learners. I developed and applied an annotation scheme of five binary features intended to capture aspects of nativelikeness and semantic appropriateness, and showed these features to have a high degree of inter-annotator agreement. I used a preference task to establish feature weights and benchmark rankings of learner responses. I showed that my system output generally correlates well with the benchmark rankings and shows a promising degree of accuracy in predicting the annotations.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/semantic-analysis-image-based-learner-sentences/docview/2622624682/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kim, Boram",2021,Lexical Stress Realization in Mandarin Second Language Learners of English: An Acoustic and Articulatory Study,"This dissertation investigated the acoustic and articulatory correlates of lexical stress in Mandarin second language (L2) learners of English, as well as in first language (L1) speakers. The present study used a minimal pair respective to stress location (e.g., OBject versus obJECT) obtained from a publicly available Mandarin Accented English Electromagnetic articulography corpus dataset. In the acoustic domain, the use of acoustic parameters (duration, intensity, F0, and vowel quality) was measured in stressed and unstressed vowels. In the articulatory domain, the positional information from tongue tip (TT), tongue dorsum (TD), upper lip (UL), lower lip (LL), and jaw (JAW) were retrieved from the concurrent vowel data. Finally, the acoustic and articulatory correlation was computed and compared both within and across groups. The acoustic analysis demonstrated that L2 speakers significantly differentiated the stressed vowels from the unstressed vowels using all suprasegmental cues, while vowel quality was extremely limitedly used in the L2 group. In the articulatory analysis, Mandarin L2 speakers demonstrated the extremely limited lexical stress effect. A significant difference as a function of lexical stress was noted only in the vertical dimension of low-back vowels. The acoustic and articulatory correlation results revealed a relatively weaker correlation in L2 speakers than in L1 speakers. In the L2 group, certain articulators such as TD and the JAW demonstrated a stronger correlation than LL and TT.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/lexical-stress-realization-mandarin-second/docview/2572931974/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Richards, Paul",2021,Computer Simulations in Pragmatics Instruction: Experimentally Investigating the Effects of Feedback on Pragmatics,"L2 pragmatics researchers have expressed considerable interest in the use of computer simulations for pragmatics instruction, particularly emphasizing their potential to replicate a variety of interactions beyond the classroom (González-Lloret, 2019; Sykes 2008). To date, however, only a handful of exploratory studies have investigated the use of computer simulations for pragmatics instruction (Holden &amp; Sykes, 2014; Sykes, 2009, 2010, 2013; Taguchi, Li, &amp; Tang, 2017). This study contributes to this growing body of research by comparing the effectiveness of two novel types of feedback on learner refusals and requests in a computer simulation of an advising session. The two feedback conditions in this study were operationalized as sociopragmatic feedback and sociopragmatic plus pragmalinguistic feedback (Leech, 2014). Sociopragmatic feedback targeted the overall politeness of a response selected in the simulation, and sociopragmatic plus pragmalinguistic feedback provided mappings between impoliteness and form. Advising sessions were chosen as the context of this study because they are meaning focused tasks that students must perform, but in general students cannot observe others participating in these tasks. The simulation was designed with reference to a corpus of role-play data collected by the researcher. Assessment instruments included oral and written Discourse Completion Tasks (DCTs), which were administered in a pretest/immediate posttest design. To make the feedback as relevant to participants as possible, in-game options were individualized to reflect participant responses on the WDCT pretest. NNS participants (N=90) were randomly assigned to the three treatment conditions (sociopragmatic, sociopragmatic plus pragmalinguistic, and control). Effectiveness of treatment was measured by examining changes in the use of semantic formulas and internal modifiers from the pretests to the posttests. Additionally, the study focuses on uptake, which was identified as incorporation of linguistic features from the simulation that were absent on the pretests (Sydorenko &amp; Tuason, 2016). Participants in the sociopragmatic plus pragmalinguistic group showed the most uptake, while the control group showed minimal change. Retrospective written reports show that while participants in the sociopragmatic plus pragmalinguistic group frequently attributed changes from in their language use to the simulation, participants in the control group rarely did. Responses also indicate that some control group participants identified the more direct responses in the simulation as most appropriate.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/computer-simulations-pragmatics-instruction/docview/2572620564/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Alsubhi, Abdullah",2021,The Development of Case Morphology and Sentential Word Order in Arabic as a Second Language: A Processability Perspective,"Processability theory argues that the development of interlanguage syntactic and morphological structures is guided by general principles, which make up a “language processor”. These principles develop gradually and are implicationally ordered. The theory claims that interlanguage syntactic and morphological structures develop in the order the principles responsible for their production become available to the learner (Pienemann, 1998; Pienemann et al., 2005). This study used these principles as reflected in processing procedures and mapping principles to investigate the acquisition of Modern Standard Arabic case morphology and sentential word order. The goal of using these principles was to hypothesize a developmental route for case morphology and declarative sentence development and then test the predictions empirically. With regard to sentential word order, several structures with different mapping principles were selected. The investigation included canonical word order, AdjunctTopic + canonical word order (e.g., CLLD), and non-canonical word order (e.g., passive, causatives, subordinate clauses, and OVS). Each structure represents a unique way of mapping the three structures of grammar (argument, function, constituent). At the morphological level, several case morphemes involving different levels of feature unification were selected. The investigation included nominative and accusative case in SVO word order, genitive case on noun phrases within prepositional phrases and construct state, accusative case on [ʔanna]-subject, and nominative and accusative case in OVS word order. Each morphological structure requires the activation of a different processing procedure. This cross-sectional study collected data from 21 adult learners of Modern Standard Arabic as an L2. Participants performed three communicative tasks: an interview, picture discerption, and elicited imitation. Emergence criteria were adopted to judge the emergence status of the structures investigated in their interlanguage. The results showed that sentential word order developed from basic word order that manifested default argument-function-constituent structure mapping to structures that manifested different degrees of divergence from such mapping. With regard to case morphology, case markers developed from mere parts of lexical items to markers of positions and to markers of grammatical functions. Therefore, the observed developmental route for L2 learners of Modern Standard Arabic confirmed the hypothesized developmental route.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-case-morphology-sentential-word-order/docview/2572546536/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"White, Donald Timothy",2021,A Longitudinal Study of Second-Language Speech Patterns after Immigration,"A Longitudinal Study of Second-Language Speech Patterns after Immigration Submitted by Donald Timothy White for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Linguistics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. This dissertation is a longitudinal phonetic investigation of L2 speech production by eight Cantonese L1-English L2 immigrants to English-speaking countries, including Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The participants, who had attended the same secondary school in Hong Kong, were recorded five times over a two-year period (once before emigration, and then at approximately six-month intervals). Data from these recordings were analysed and compared across the recordings of each speaker. Specifically, this analysis measured aspects of the speech stream that are often associated with L2 English accents in L1 Cantonese speakers. Segmentally, these comparisons include vowels (/iː/, /ɪ/, /ɛ/, /æ/, and /ɑː/), and consonants (word-final /ɹ/ and intervocalic [ɾ]). Suprasegmentally, these comparisons focused on speech rhythm as measured by seven durational metrics: Pairwise Variability Indices (PVI) for Consonantal (1), Vocalic (2), and Syllabic (3) intervals; Normalized Global Variability (Varco) for Consonantal (4), Vocalic (5), and Syllabic (6) intervals; and global percentage of vocalic intervals (%V) (7). In addition, a small amount of intonational data and connected speech processes were examined. Speech samples from each time point were rated by native speakers of American and Australian English for foreign accent, comprehensibility, and intelligibility. Throughout the two-year observation period, several acoustical modifications by the participants correlated with ratings for decreased foreign accent, increased comprehensibility, and increased intelligibility. These modifications included widening distinction between /i:/ and /I/, replacing intervocalic [t h ] with [ɾ], increased rhoticity, and increased durational variability as gauged by the speech rhythm metrics. These results were also considered in light of language experience factors, which were less generalizable due to individual differences; however, they were the focus of detailed analyses in the developmental paths of each participant. Among these language experience factors were the ratio of English to Cantonese use, innate phonetic ability, the desire to integrate, the desire to return to Hong Kong after graduating from university, residing with a host family, and demographic details of their new places of residence. As the study progressed, the importance of these individual differences became increasingly apparent. They are crucial to understanding the specific phonetic results of the eight participants.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/longitudinal-study-second-language-speech/docview/2570355930/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Llewellyn, Natsuko",2021,Politeness Strategies Used in Invitations in Japanese,"This study explored how Japanese as Foreign Language (JFL) utilize politeness strategies compared to native speakers of Japanese (J1) in invitation discourses within the framework of Interlanguage Pragmatics (ILP). Invitation is one of the speech acts that requires careful consideration when conveying speakers’ intentions through speech. It is assumed that JFL will struggle with appropriately inviting friends in different culture while utilizing the politeness strategies in their invitation discourse in Japanese. Szatrowski (1993) revealed that there are thoughtful utterances to each other, the discernment utterance by the inviter and considerate utterance by the invitee, in the Japanese invitation discourse. Native Japanese speakers create the invitation discourse mutually unlike English turn-taking discourse. In order to analyze JFL and J1’s discourse, data were collected from a roleplay conversation with four different scenarios. The participants invited the researcher to act as their friends, both close and distant, for two types of events, a group event and a one-on-one event. In all variations, the invitee showed slight hesitation and said she had an exam the next day. The discourse was analyzed in terms of the invitation discourse and the follow-up discourse after the invitee’s hesitation. The data showed that (1) intermediate level of JFL used the polite speech styles with the close friend and the distant friend carefully for the invitation, although J1 utilized a casual style and a mixed style tactfully to their friends, (2) JFL differentiated the invitation structures between the negative and affirmative forms depending on the level of intimacy, while J1 used mainly a negative style and various indirect ways in their invitation, (3) the negative politeness strategy used the most by JFL gave deference in the invitation utterance, while J1 minimized the imposition of the invitee the most, (4) JFL used less than half the amount of the politeness strategies of J1 for the follow-up utterances, (5) for the one-on-one invitation, more than half of JFL gave up their invitation after the invitee’s hesitation in the follow-up utterance, and (6) J1 used more politeness strategies with the close friend than the distant friend in the follow-up utterances both for the group event and the one-on-one event. From the results of these findings, I suggest four steps that instructors can use to teach Japanese invitation discourse.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/politeness-strategies-used-invitations-japanese/docview/2564460899/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Francois, Jennifer",2021,Impact of Multimodal Feedback and Formulaic Sequences on Improving Fluency of English Learners on Computer-Based Speaking Assessments,"While recent research has shown that multimodal feedback and use of formulaic sequences (FS) are effective in improving student performance on writing tasks, there is a dearth of studies on the impact of these aspects on computer-based academic speaking assessments. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by examining the impact of both multimodal feedback and formulaic sequences (FS) on improving performance and fluency of adolescent English Learners (ELs) on computer-based speaking assessments. Students in this interactive sequential mixed methods study were randomly assigned to a group receiving asynchronous feedback or a group receiving synchronous video feedback. Both groups were evaluated using the WIDA Speaking Interpretive Rubric that analyzes speech holistically at the word/phrase level, sentence level, and discourse level. Students then engaged in a second speaking task and were evaluated using the same rubric. Results indicated that both groups showed significant overall improvements: asynchronous feedback ( n = 12, Task One Mdn = 3.00, Task Two Mdn = 4.50, Z = 3.07, p &lt; .001, r = .89) and synchronous feedback ( n = 12, Task One Mdn = 3.00, Task Two Mdn = 3.83, Z = 2.59, p = .008, r = .75), with the asynchronous feedback group out-performing the synchronous feedback group. Furthermore, regression analysis indicated that formulaic sequences significantly predicted speech fluency (β = 1.01, t (46) = 9.65, p &lt; .001). Formulaic sequences also explained a significant proportion of variance in fluency scores ( R 2 = .67, F (1, 46) = 93.20, p &lt; .001). Results from this study can inform and optimize remote and face-to-face (F2F) instruction in academic speaking and the implications include not only potentially improving EL students’ skills on standardized measures of academic speaking performance, but also enhancing their linguistic skills in general education classes and improving their college and career readiness.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/impact-multimodal-feedback-formulaic-sequences-on/docview/2564141160/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Qi, Runqing",2021,An Instructional Model for Using Authentic Texts in L2 Chinese Reading Classrooms,"For second language (L2) learners of Chinese who are native speakers of alphabetic languages, it is common that even after years of learning, reading discourse-length authentic Chinese texts (e.g., newspaper articles and novels) is still an intimidating, laborious, and frustrating task. Two factors, among others, contribute to this problem. One is the predominant use of pedagogical texts (readings that have been written specifically for L2 learners, often a poor representation of real-life language use) in lower-level instruction. The other is the lack of systematic attention to the development of students’ reading skills in intermediate-level instruction. As a result, L2 Chinese learners do not accumulate sufficient experience in reading authentic texts or develop necessary reading strategies to interact with these types of texts. Consequently, they are ill prepared for upper-level Chinese courses and, more important, for real-life reading tasks. To bridge the gap between classroom reading and real-life reading, this dissertation proposes a theory-guided and research-based instructional model for using discourse-length authentic texts in intermediate-level L2 Chinese classrooms. The model consists of three interactive components: (1) text selection and modification; (2) progressive reading and reading strategy instruction; and (3) reading progress assessments. Detailed criteria, methods, and steps are proposed for each component. To investigate the impact of the model on learners’ reading processes and comprehension, as well as to explore learners’ perceptions of the model, I implemented the model through eight reading sessions with 14 second-year university L2 Chinese learners. Data were collected from small-group interviews, surveys, reading assessments (including reading tests, self-evaluations, and reading journals), and teaching reflective journals. Based on the analysis of data from these sources, I found that with instruction aligned with the model, the students developed real-life reading skills. They were able not only to understand and connect to these texts, but also to perceive how language is used in real-life communication. Students also learned to apply multiple reading strategies to facilitate their comprehension of authentic texts on a variety of topics. They not only learned new reading strategies that direct their attention to sentential and discourse-level understanding, but also gradually developed the habit of applying multiple reading strategies while reading. These findings suggest that the systematic scaffolding provided by the model facilitated the learners’ understanding of the authentic texts through effectively mediating the interaction between the learners and those texts. Students’ perceptions of the model were positive: They considered the instruction interesting, stimulating, and helpful. In particular, they spoke highly of reading strategy instruction and group reading. The process of reading and discussing in small groups promoted knowledge sharing and reduced students’ reading stress. Nevertheless, some students occasionally suffered from peer pressure when there were disparities in the reading proficiency of the group members. Although few students did the after-class independent reading, those who completed it consistently enjoyed it and acknowledged the usefulness of the reading guidelines. The model proposed in the study provides a systematic and practical guidance for L2 Chinese instructors to teach reading at the post-secondary intermediate level using discourse-length authentic texts. It contributes to bridging the gap between classroom L2 Chinese reading and reading in real-life contexts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/instructional-model-using-authentic-texts-l2/docview/2562780437/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Côté, Stephanie Élin",2021,The Independent and Combined Effects of Cognitive and Affective Variables on the L2 Acquisition of French Grammatical Gender Agreement,"A defining characteristic of second language (L2) acquisition is the well-attested variability observed between learners, often despite comparable exposure to the target language. In an attempt to explain this variability, researchers have considered the effects of various individual difference variables, cognitive and affective factors that distinguish learners from one another. The goal of this dissertation is to further our understanding of the roles of two such variables, foreign language anxiety (FLA) and working memory (WM). Each of these variables has been previously shown to impact L2 learners’ success individually, and Eysenck and colleague’s Attentional Control Theory (ACT) suggests that anxiety may impede WM resources, meaning these variables may also interact to predict L2 learning. While such an interaction has been alluded to in SLA research, few studies have empirically investigated the potential combined effects of FLA and WM on L2 learning. In order to address this gap, a study was designed to investigate the independent and combined effects of FLA and WM on intermediate proficiency French learners’ grammatical gender agreement accuracy. Sixty-one L1 English-speaking learners of French completed a Spot-the-difference picture description task designed to elicit instances of noun-adjective gender agreement varying in the syntactic distance between the head noun and modifying adjective. Learners were significantly more accurate with local agreement than with agreement that crosses syntactic boundaries, in line with Pienemann’s (1998, 2005) Processability Theory. Furthermore, FLA and WM each made contributions to agreement accuracy scores; FLA predicted a small amount of the variance of long-distance agreement scores only, while WM was a significant predictor of agreement in all three of the constructions considered here. However, no significant interaction was found between the variables, which appears to contradict ACT’s predictions. Various explanations for this finding are explored. In summary, this dissertation makes important contributions to the growing body of research on individual differences in L2 acquisition by considering FLA’s effects on a specific grammatical construction, namely gender agreement; by expanding previous research on WM’s role in agreement processing to oral production; and by empirically testing the possible interaction of FLA and WM in L2 grammatical accuracy.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/independent-combined-effects-cognitive-affective/docview/2561944755/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Li, Lulu",2021,Discourse-Conditioned <em>wh- in situ</em> in L1 Francilian French and as Acquired by Advanced English- and Mandarin-Speaking Learners,"This dissertation first tests Hamlaoui’s (2011) hypothesis that the use of wh- in situ (SVQ) in colloquial French is conditioned by givenness, specifically, that in situ questions should be favoured when the non wh- portion (SVC) is discourse-given. It then examines first language (L1) influence on the second language acquisition (L2A) of wh- variation in French in two advanced learner groups with typologically distinct L1s: Mandarin, a wh- in situ language, and English, a language that requires obligatory wh- fronting. As concerns the L2 acquisition of wh- variation, our main hypothesis predicts L1-based syntactic influences, namely, the over-dependence on canonical SVQ order for L1-Mandarin and fronted variants for L1-English speakers. To test the hypotheses for both native speakers (NSs) and L2 learners, we conducted a study involving three participant groups (15 NSs, 10 Sinophones, and 10 Anglophones). The principal task was an Oral Discourse Completion Task in which each item elicited a wh- question for a discourse-context intended to favour either a fronted wh- or an SVQ variant. Consistent with Hamlaoui’s hypothesis, NSs used more in situ questions when the SVC portion was given. Importantly, they also preferred SVQ when the SVC portion was not given, which may potentially be attributed to participants’ motivation to be sociostylistically appropriate. We raise the possibility that sociostylistic factors can override discourse-related factors in NSs’ use of the target structures. Regarding the L2 learners, neither group was overly dependent on the canonical wh- order of their L1, and contrary to our prediction, the L1-English but not the L1-Mandarin group’s performance was target-like. We propose that the infelicitous use of fronted wh- variants by the L1-Mandarin group in discourse-given contexts can be explained with reference to L1 influence (namely, a strong preference for the canonical SV sentence order in Mandarin) and the more restricted input of these learners’ academic setting that contrasted with the work setting of the English group, which included exposure to sociopragmatically correct input beneficial to L2 discourse development. Accordingly, our study also highlights the essential role of input quality in the L2A of variable syntactic structures.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/discourse-conditioned-em-wh-situ-l1-francilian/docview/2556490691/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tahmouresi, Somayeh",2021,On the Role of Individual Differences in the L2 Writing Achievement,"Individual differences factors (IDs) play significant roles in second language (L2) learning. Compared to the general field of SLA, however, little is known in the L2 writing domain regarding the influence of learner factors in L2 writing achievement. Therefore, in this study, I aimed to extend the IDs research in L2 writing by closely examining the interaction between students’ cognitive abilities, motivational levels, and emotional experiences on one hand and their L2 writing achievement on the other. To that end, I drew on the latest theoretical developments in the field of SLA to conceptualize students’ motivational orientations and emotional experiences during L2 writing and explore how those affective variables as well as their L2 learning abilities contribute to their success in L2 writing. A total of 85 university students learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL) at a private university participated in the study by filling out several questionnaires and taking a language aptitude test. The students were also asked to write an essay about a specific topic. Factor analytic results substantiated the construct validity of the L2 writing selves scales. In addition, reliability analyses confirmed the internal consistency of all the motivational, emotional, and cognitive measures. Two raters also graded the students’ essays both holistically and analytically in terms of complexity, accuracy, and fluency. To answer the research questions, a series of multiple regression were conducted. The results showed that the ideal L2 writing self positively predicted L2 writing joy, motivation, and achievement, whereas ought L2 writing self positively predicted L2 writing anxiety and motivation. Although both L2 writing enjoyment and anxiety predicted L2 writing motivation positively, L2 writing anxiety predicted L2 writing course grade negatively. Aptitude was also found as a positive predictor of L2 writing achievement. Considering the CAF measures, only ideal L2 writing self predicted the fluency. Overall, the findings provided a clear picture on the role of IDs in the development of L2 writing.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/on-role-individual-differences-l2-writing/docview/2548640820/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Alazmi, Mastourah",2021,Gradience in Split Intransitivity and Lexical Aspect in Modern Standard Arabic,"The Split Intransitivity Hierarchy (SIH) proposed by Sorace (2000) is an aspectually gradient classification of unaccusative and unergative verbs. This hierarchy has been attested in many Western European languages. However, little is known about typologically different languages. This dissertation provides an account of the gradience in aspectual and thematic specification of intransitives in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). It seeks to confirm whether the SIH exists in Arabic and whether it applies to its syntactic characteristics of split intransitivity. Following Sorace’s classifications, Arabic intransitives are divided into seven categories: change of location, change of state, continuation of a pre-existing state, existence of state, uncontrolled process, controlled motional process, and controlled nonmotional process. To test the behavior of these verb classes, the researcher applies diagnostics of split intransitivity and carries out tests of telicity, stativity, and durativity. In addition, the researcher examines the contribution of the outer/grammatical aspect to the inner/lexical aspectual specification of the verb in MSA. Native speakers’ judgment is utilized to distinguish grammatical examples from ungrammatical ones. The results confirm the existence of the SIH in Arabic. Arabic intransitives are subject to systematic variation in their lexical aspect as they show different degrees of telicity and durativity. Specifically, verbs of change of location show core unaccusative/telic behavior, while verbs of change of state oscillate in their telicity. Verbs in the middle of the hierarchy are the most indeterminate about their aspectual and thematic realization. The findings also reveal that Arabic verbs of continuation are durative, while verbs of existence are mostly stative. Moreover, durative classes in Arabic show variable degrees of durativity. In particular, the class of uncontrolled process displays the lowest degree of durativity. Verbs of controlled motional process are more unergative/durative than verbs of uncontrolled process and less categorical in their behavior than verbs of controlled nonmotional process. Finally, verbs that denote controlled nonmotional processes are core unergative/durative and the most unambiguous in their behavior. Overall, Arabic intransitives keep their original aspectual classification even when changing the outer aspect from perfective to imperfective.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/gradience-split-intransitivity-lexical-aspect/docview/2532559237/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Zheng, Qi",2022,Variation in Interlanguage: Evidence from Internal and External Patterning of Morphosyntactic Variability in the Speech of Second Language Learners,"Language is inherently variable, and learner language is particularly variable. The variationist paradigm considers learner language a heterogeneously variable yet inherently rule-governed system. Specifically, learners’ alternation between native-like and nonnative-like variants of a variable or invariable target native speaker (NS) form constitutes learner language variation. Variation is also viewed as an indication of a transitional phase towards acquisition (e.g., Regan, 2013; Tagliamonte, 2011). With a particular concentration on second language (L2) morphosyntactic variation, this dissertation explored inter-learner variation and intra-learner variability together with interlanguage development by analyzing Japanese L2 learners’ oral performances in English oral proficiency interviews. The research observed and studied the variation pattern in the interview data and identified the linguistic, paralinguistic, and nonlinguistic factors and factor groups which may give rise to Japanese L2 learners’ repeated exercise of their interlanguage grammar for four morphosyntactic features: preposition/particle, article, object pronoun-dropping, and modal auxiliary verb. The data were analyzed by using classification trees, random forests, and mixed-effects variable rule methods which together identified a hierarchy of variable importance among potential factors and factor groups and the influential factor levels within each significant factor group. With modern mixed models, the dissertation concluded that the observed morphosyntactic variation is subject to inter-lingual and intra-learner factors. Additionally, learners may also have individualized baselines and grammar. More importantly, the findings of the current research have provided important theoretical and empirical justification on whether and how individual patterns mirror the interlanguage patterns and hence an inter-lingual developmental understanding of L2 morphosyntactic competence.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/variation-interlanguage-evidence-internal/docview/2726576860/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hanaoka, Vera E.W.",2022,Identity Construction of International Students in Japan: L2 Japanese Speakers’ Meta-Awareness of Their Positioning in Interaction,"This dissertation examines how L2 Japanese speaker international students experience their subjectivity (Harré &amp; Gillett, 1994), that is, how their language use and actions convey their thoughts and feelings, their sense of self, and how they relate to the world around them, in casual conversations with L1 Japanese speaker peers. In order to investigate L2 speaker subjectivity, this study analyzes audio-video conversation and interview data to determine 1) L2-L1 Japanese speaker pairs’ jointly accomplished identity construction achieved through their positioning (Davies &amp; Harré, 1990) in interaction, 2) L2 Japanese speakers’ folklinguistic theories—lay theories about language use— (Imai, Nojima &amp; Okada, 2012; Miller &amp; Ginsburg, 1995) about such positioning, and 3) L2 Japanese speakers’ meta-awareness, evidenced by their descriptions of their theories of how discursive, pragmatic, and semiotic resources are utilized in positioning. The study participants used a) the first-person masculine pronouns boku and ore , and the first-person neutral pronoun watashi , b) the Kansai dialect of Western Japan perceived nationwide as frank and humorous, and c) the boke-tsukkomi (fool-straight man) comedic routine as resources for positioning. Drawing on these three categories of resources, the L2-L1 Japanese speaker pairs construct a relationship through their mutual acceptance of storylines (Davies &amp; Harré, 1990, van Langenhove &amp; Harré, 1999) that form the basis of their positioning. An analysis of the participants’ folklinguistic theories indicated that they had highly descriptive meta-awareness of Kansai dialect, moderately descriptive meta-awareness of first-person pronouns, and rudimentary meta-awareness of the boke-tsukkomi comedic routine. The findings of this dissertation contribute to the scholarship on L2 speaker identity construction and language learning ideology, both through what they elucidate about the participants’ positioning in interaction and their folklinguistic theories about such positioning, and through the investigation of the under-researched demographic of highly proficient international student sojourners. The study’s novel methodology, of interviewing the L2-L1 participant pairs together using a stimulated-recall protocol with video stimuli generated from their conversation sessions, facilitated a situated and detailed analysis of their ideologies surrounding their identity construction. This dissertation provides further concrete evidence that L2 speakers are holistic individuals who use their L2 to form complex social pasts, presents, and futures, and to have interactions and to construct relationships are that “meaningful and consequential” (Firth &amp; Wagner, 2007), laying the groundwork for future interactions and relationships based on shared social history with their L1 speaker peers.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/identity-construction-international-students/docview/2726915179/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Ferguson, Peter",2022,English as a Foreign Language in Japan’s Elementary Schools: A Multiple Case Study on Language Policy Interpretation and Implementation,"Beginning in April 2020, the Japanese government continued its English education language policy reform by introducing foreign language instruction as an academic subject for Grade 5 and Grade 6 students. The purpose of this study was to investigate how stakeholders across the education system have contended with policy creation, policy interpretation, and policy appropriation in public elementary school classrooms. Using a conceptual framework of ethnography of language policy and open systems theory, this multiple case study was designed to investigate policy as text, policy as discourse, and policy as classroom practice. In order to achieve these aims I used qualitative methods of data collection that included content analysis of policy documents, and interviews with national policymakers, educational authorities from local Boards of Education, school principals, and classroom teachers. In addition, observations of English lessons at three public elementary schools within the same prefecture were analyzed to understand how the schools approached policy implementation and how close did the teachers’ appropriation of EFL lessons correspond with the goals of the 2020 Course of Study. The 2020 Elementary School Course of Study established English as an academic subject for students in Grades 5 and 6. An analysis of the policy documents revealed positive changes in the realignment of the purpose and aims of education from elementary school through high school. In addition, the 2020 Course of Study introduces an updated assessment framework for teaching and learning across all subjects for elementary school, junior high school and high school. However, how English is conceptualized and integrated into the national curriculum appears in places not to match some of the new aims of the 2020 Course of Study and uses ambivalent terms, such as language activities with little guidance for teachers on how to teach English. The interviews with participants provided insights from various stakeholders on their beliefs and experiences towards educational language policy creation, transmission, and implementation. A total of 72 interviews were conducted for this study. National-level policymakers and advisors spoke of the politics during policy formulation. In addition, discursive struggles between conservative and progress views of education and foreign language education also influenced policymakers’ objectives. A discourse of expertise, which restricted agency and voice for certain participants, also emerged from the interview data. All of these points and others created a situation where policy implementation took on a form of bricolage. During the 17 months of field work at the three participating schools, 58 lessons were observed, recorded, and analyzed. The findings from the classroom observations revealed that each school’s approach to implementing English as a subject in Grades 5 and 6 changed each year. Teachers had difficulties navigating shifting discourses towards English lessons, along with understanding new and ambiguous terminology towards teaching practices and assessment. The findings showed that teachers were generally meeting the goals of the 2020 English Course of Study; however, the teaching of reading and listening were problematic for many teachers. The discussion section comprises implications for future policy creation and implementation, classroom pedagogy, and the theoretical implications. The intended audience for this investigation includes stakeholders interested in applied linguistics, language policy and planning, comparative education, and Japanese studies. This study contributes to the research on educational language policy and our understanding that policy is more than declaring and seeking particular outcomes, but a consistently evolving process with conflicting discourses and ideologies. This study adds to our understanding how the structure of Japan’s education system and the social organization of the schools can enable and inhibit certain stakeholders positioned across the education system. Lastly, this study contributes to our understanding of what it means to be an English teacher in Japan’s public elementary school schools.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/english-as-foreign-language-japan-s-elementary/docview/2764495402/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kusumastuti, Wuri Prima",2024,Communities of Autonomous Language Learners: Participation Spaces in Social Media (Three Articles Dissertation),"The field of autonomous language learning in second language acquisition has experienced significant growth since its introduction by Holec in the 1980s. Several studies have explored how to promote learning autonomy in various spaces, including online learning environments. However, research related to autonomous language learning in online informal spaces is still ongoing. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by examining the role of online informal learning in promoting autonomous language learning, specifically focusing on how communities of autonomous language learners (CoALLs) empower and support their members to improve their learning autonomy and language proficiency. Additionally, it explores how fully autonomous language learners (FALLs) seek interaction online to enhance their second language proficiency. The dissertation consists of three studies: a literature review and two empirical studies. The literature review synthesizes research on autonomous language learning in online social spaces, analyzing articles published between 2010 and 2023. It identifies four major themes: language learning activities, learners' proficiency, anatomy of interaction, and learner affect, suggesting that informal online learning spaces benefit learner autonomy and language acquisition. The first empirical study explores CoALL dynamics, focusing on discussion topics, activities, and interactions. Findings suggest that CoALLs offer opportunities for instructional activities, peer collaboration, translanguage practice, competition, and professional development, motivating FALLs to participate actively. The second empirical study investigates FALLs' activities in digital spaces, using the individual network of practice (INoP) framework. It explores how FALLs use social media to seek interactions and facilitate language learning progression, revealing insights into their activities and INoP. The PRISMA framework guided the systematic literature review, comprising four stages: identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion, to consolidate findings from various sources. Database searches were conducted using specific keywords to cover a 2010-2023 timeframe, yielding 945 studies. After screening titles, abstracts, and keywords, 57 articles were selected for full-text review, and 40 articles were ultimately included in the review based on established criteria. Meanwhile, for the empirical studies, the data were collected through interviews with members of the Facebook group Polyglot Indonesia, supplemented by analysis of group documents and artifacts. This study extends understanding of CoALLs and FALLs, highlighting how community-led regulations in informal spaces can create productive learning environments for FALLs. It also explores how individual choices in navigating online spaces influence autonomous language learning. The research underscores the value of informal online spaces for language learning, suggesting ways for educators and policymakers to integrate these aspects into formal education through peer collaboration, translanguage practice, and professional development. Policymakers could support online language learning communities by providing resources and incentives.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/communities-autonomous-language-learners/docview/3051318209/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Gracia, Emilia",2024,Immersive Virtual Reality for L2 Pragmatics Instruction in an Intensive English Program at a US University,"This study examines the impact of High-Immersion Virtual Reality (HiVR) as a tool for teaching English L2 pragmatics to international students enrolled in an Intensive English Program at a US university. This research focuses on integrating HiVR into explicit L2 pragmatics instructional treatments. A quasi-experimental design was employed to assess the pragmatic performance of students in both experimental (HiVR) and control groups across four pragmatics tasks during an eight-week intermediate level course. The findings show a significant advantage for the experimental group, suggesting that HiVR practice enhances learning outcomes in L2 pragmatics. Qualitative feedback revealed participants' enjoyment and perceived realism of VR practice, highlighting the potential of HiVR for simulating real-life conversational scenarios. This study contributes to the field of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) by demonstrating the efficacy of HiVR in improving L2 pragmatic competence.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/immersive-virtual-reality-l2-pragmatics/docview/3049971179/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Cherici, Alessia",2024,Alternative Realities Investigating Comprehension and Production of Counterfactuals by L1-English Learners of Chinese,"Counterfactuals are a type of conditional sentences used to convey situations that do not correspond to reality. Tense morphology is a core ingredient to encode counterfactuals in English and most Indo-European languages. Mandarin Chinese (hereafter Chinese) lacks tense morphology and does not require counterfactuals to be formally distinguished from other types of conditionals. In the past, this lack of obligatory and systematic counterfactual marking led scholars to hypothesize that Chinese native speakers (NSs) may have a diminished ability to reason counterfactually. Research involving NSs has eventually debunked this belief, unveiling the existence of specific linguistic strategies systematically used in Chinese counterfactual expression. However, no study has tested learners on either production or comprehension of Chinese counterfactuals. This study contributes to filling this gap by investigating how L1-English learners of Chinese-as-a-foreign-language (CFL) interpret and produce counterfactuals in Chinese by means of different linguistic strategies. To this end, a truth-value judgment task and a written sentence-completion task were devised and administered to 51 CFL learners and 29 Chinese NSs. The results revealed that both comprehension and production are modulated by foreign language proficiency, and the targeted linguistic strategies are mastered at different stages of acquisition, with differing patterns between comprehension and production. Furthermore, despite the fact that counterfactuals need not be overtly marked in Chinese and can be expressed and interpreted based on context and world knowledge, results indicated that in the absence of linguistic marking, most learners do not reach counterfactual interpretation. The qualitative examination of learners’ task responses also suggested that L1-English partially influences the acquisition process of Chinese counterfactual expression, both in a facilitative and non-facilitative fashion. Lastly, the findings of this study confirmed that even if not explicitly taught, learners can eventually acquire the linguistic strategies used to express counterfactuals in Chinese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/alternative-realities-investigating-comprehension/docview/3044423926/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Aydın, Esra",2023,Formative Assessment and Speech Act Development in Young Foreign Learners: A Focus on Native Speakers of Turkish Learning English,"This thesis aims to investigate the development of request and apology speech acts and strategies used by Turkish young learners of English and to examine what extent formative assessment influences their acquisition of speech acts. To achieve these aims, the research was designed as a true- experimental study consisting of experimental and control groups. The participants in the study were divided into two groups as those with (experimental group) and without formative assessment (control group), and some stages (1 st assessment and feedback) were not applied to the group without formative assessment to see the difference between groups. The current study was conducted in 5 different phases, which are pre-test, treatment procedure, 1 st assessment, feedback, and post-test. The study was completed in 3 months during a term. Data were collected via multiple data collection instruments, such as camera recordings, worksheets, self- assessment forms, teacher observation forms. The purpose of using various data collection tools was to triangulate to collect reliable data. In addition, to make the data analysis more objective and reliable, the data collected at each stage was shared with another teacher, and the results and discussion section were shaped by comparing the results obtained by this teacher with the results of the researcher. The results obtained from recordings, forms, worksheets, and other teacher’s notes during the present study showed that formative assessment positively affects young learners’ motivation and self-confidence in addition to their language performance.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/formative-assessment-speech-act-development-young/docview/3122681853/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nelson, Christina",2023,Do a Learner’s L1 and L2 Change With Increasing L3 Exposure? Investigating Regressive Phonological Cross-linguistic Influence in Adolescent and Adult L3 Learners,"Arguably, from time to time every person who speaks more than one language experiences phenomena such as lexical access difficulties due to other languages, using another language’s syntax or applying phonological rules from another language. Such striking instances of cross-linguistic influence (CLI), the interaction of a speaker’s languages, are only the tip of the iceberg. As a plethora of studies over the last decades has consistently demonstrated, languages constantly interact and influence each other in the multilingual mind (Cenoz et al., 2001). Accordingly, rather than rigidly separated entities, a speaker’s languages are presumed to coexist within a complex and interconnected system (De Bot, 2012). The majority of previous studies has mainly focused on the progressive kind of CLI, i.e., from an earlier learned language onto a subsequent one (see, e.g., De Angelis, 2007, p. 20; Wunder, 2011, p. 107). However, CLI also occurs the other way around, namely from a later learned language onto an earlier one. In fact, we know from a solid body of attrition research that even a speaker’s first language (henceforth L1) is not as stable as once presumed. Language attrition is a well-documented phenomenon in the context of speakers who spend extended periods abroad and, as a result, experience changes or problems with their native language. Köpke and Schmid (2004) define attrition much more generally as a “non‐pathological decrease in a language that had previously been acquired by an individual” (p. 5). The vast majority of language attrition studies focus on immigrant contexts and only take L1 attrition into account, but several second language (henceforth L2; a further discussion of terminology ensues in the following chapter) phonology studies conducted in this line of thinking have suggested that the development of a new language system, even in low‐proficiency instructed learners, will impact the L1 phonology to some degree (Schmid &amp; Hopp, 2014, p. 371). These mostly temporary and subtle changes of a learner’s pronunciation in their L1 have been termed “gestural drift” (Sancier &amp; Fowler, 1997) or “phonetic drift” (C. B. Chang, 2012), and there seems to be a growing interest in this phenomenon. Naturally, there is even more potential for cross-linguistic interactions of this kind in the case of third language (henceforth L3) learners. These learners possess at least two already existing language subsystems which could be subject to changes triggered by the onset of learning a new language. When three or more languages are involved, the possibilities for intricate and diverse patterns of mutual interaction become considerably more complex. For instance, multilingual learners (i.e., those with three or more languages), compared to those learning only their first non-native language, can experience phenomena such as combined CLI. This occurs “when two or more languages interact with one another and concur in influencing the target language, or whenever one language influences another, and the already-influenced language in turn influences another language in the process of being acquired” (De Angelis, 2007, 49; for examples of this kind of CLI see, e.g., Blank &amp; Zimmer, 2009; Pyun, 2005). One of the important questions with regard to regressive influence in multilingual learners is what factors condition this form of CLI and which of a learner’s languages are more susceptible to it than others. In the few L3 studies conducted in this line of inquiry, the effect of language status is discussed frequently. Although their findings are somewhat mixed and exhibit much individual variation, there seems to be a tendency for more L3→L2 than L3→L1 influence (see Section 3.6.3). It should be noted, however, that these studies are rather exploratory and thus naturally limited in the number and population of speakers, learning contexts, and features under investigation. For instance, there is a dearth of knowledge concerning child and adolescent speakers at this point, despite the fact that age as a variable holds particular relevance when it comes to regressive CLI. In this connection, hypotheses about language status have been put forth suggesting that a person’s L1 may be more stable and thus less malleable or vulnerable than even a native-like L2 due to maturational constraints, i.e., as a result of age of learning (see Section 3.6.4 for a discussion of Cabrelli’s (2016) phonological permeability hypothesis). Age in this context is usually conceptualized as the binary differentiation of pre- versus post-pubescent, and its effect on CLI has only ever been assessed ‘retrospectively’ in adult speakers, for example by comparing mirrorimage groups of early and a late adult bilinguals at some point during the early stages of L3 learning (e.g., Cabrelli, 2016; Cabrelli &amp; Rothman, 2010). While such investigations are insightful with regard to other research questions (e.g., those of maturational constraints of language learning), they are more product-oriented in nature and therefore do not shed much light on how multilinguals of different age groups develop in their languages over time. What is more, due to the common onset of additional language learning (i.e., by learners who have already learned or are in the process of learning at least one language beside their L1) at around 11–13 years in the educational systems of many countries, there is a large number of L3 learners in instructed learning contexts that evade the dichotomy of pre- and post-pubescent learners, as they virtually fall in the middle of the two. This group has so far been majorly underrepresented in phonological L3 research in general (but see Kopečková, 2016; Kopečková et al., 2021; Llama &amp; López-Morelos, 2016; Nelson, 2020; Nelson et al., 2021).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/do-learner-s-l1-l2-change-with-increasing-l3/docview/3122643619/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Yagi, Junichi",2023,"Co-Operative Instruction in Music and Sports: Language(s), Body, and Objects","As demonstrated by past ethnomethodological and conversation-analytic research, the interactional work of teaching is inherently embodied (Hall &amp; Looney, 2019). This is particularly true for instruction in performance-based activities such as music and sports . Adopting the theoretical and methodological perspectives of multimodal conversation analysis (Mondada, 2019), this dissertation aims to explicate how participants locally organize the work of teaching and learning embodied skills (Ehmer &amp; Brône, 2021) to produce, and sustain, the normative order of the setting (Garfinkel, 2002). To this end, the study examines corrections, instructions, and transitions within and across three activity contexts: taiko ensemble rehearsals, Muay Thai training, and jazz/blues band rehearsals. The key findings are as follows. First, correction and instruction are contingently managed through participants’ retrospective and prospective orientations. These differences in orientation help shape the local organization of the activity-at-hand, affording unique interactional practices such as choral chanting (Yagi, 2022). Second, instructional activities in performance-based settings involve the use of activity-specific objects (Nevile et al., 2014), some of which can impose material constraints on manual mobility (Yagi, 2023). Participants nevertheless manage to work around these constraints via embodied and contextually afforded practices (Yagi, 2021b). Finally, while vocalizations figure prominently in both music and sports, they differ in terms of conventionality, with some being subject to correction and contestation (Choe &amp; Yagi, 2023; Yagi, 2022). Based on C. Goodwin’s (2018) theory of co-operative action, the discussion argues that members’ methods for teaching and correcting may have diversified within sedimented landscapes as single instances accumulate in interaction. From an ecological perspective, a practice adapts to its surrounding environment through each path it takes. Such accumulation of diversity may then equip participants with a refined repertoire of teaching practices, through which they can effectively teach the set of embodied skills that constitute the work of their community.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/co-operative-instruction-music-sports-language-s/docview/2937466127/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Salgado, Hugo",2023,New Voices for Ancestral Sounds: The Acquisition of Nawat Phonology by Speakers of Salvadoran Spanish,"Nawat, the highly endangered indigenous language of El Salvador, is undergoing a revitalization process. This dissertation, conceived within this context, focuses on the second-language (L2) acquisition of features of Nawat pronunciation by learners who have Salvadoran Spanish as their first language (L1). Specifically, I assess the acquisition of one Nawat segmental feature and one prosodic feature through their production by L2 learners: 1) the Nawat velar stop phoneme /ɡ/, which has different allophones according to its surrounding sounds, and 2) Nawat utterance-final vowel glottalization, that is, the production of utterance-final vowels with increased constriction of the vocal folds to signal the end of an utterance. The goals of this dissertation are: 1) to explore whether L2 Nawat learners become more proficient in the production of these Nawat features as their years of Nawat study increase, 2) to identify the linguistic contexts in which the productions of these Nawat features by L2 learners differ the most from L1 Nawat speakers, and 3) to assess whether the progress in the L2 acquisition of these Nawat features is equally linear or if one aspect is more difficult to learn than the other. For this purpose, a total of 21 L2 Nawat learners were recorded performing a reading task in Nawat and Spanish designed to elicit the sounds of interest in different contexts. A control group consisting of five L1 Nawat speakers were also recorded performing open-ended interviews and a picture description task to serve as a baseline. I find that, overall, L2 Nawat learners become more proficient in the production of Nawat /ɡ/ as their years of study increase. However, there are contexts in which productions of Nawat /ɡ/ by L2 learners and L1 speakers consistently diverge, namely, when word-initial /ɡ/ is in the post-lateral position and when word- medial /ɡ/ is in the post-approximant, post-lateral, and post-obstruent contexts. I argue that these differences are the result of L1 transfer and hypercorrection. As for the L2 acquisition of Nawat utterance-final vowel glottalization, progress is observed but, unlike Nawat /ɡ/, even the most advanced learners do not produce Nawat utterance-final vowels at rates comparable to L1 speakers. In fact, most Nawat utterance-final vowels produced by L2 learners show weakened voicing rather than glottalization, which I interpret as L1 transfer. Thus, an asymmetry in the acquisition of these features of Nawat pronunciation is identified, which I attribute to the inherent complexity of prosody, the perceived similarity between the L1 and L2 sound systems, frequency, and the Nawat input received by L2 learners. This dissertation highlights the need to inform the Nawat teaching curricula to focus on the production and perception of utterance-final vowel glottalization and develop more effective pedagogical materials and practices to teach them.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/new-voices-ancestral-sounds-acquisition-nawat/docview/2879026825/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Smith, Hye Young Choi",2023,Interactional Uses of Self-Talk in Korean,"This study explores the interactional uses of self-talk in Korean. “Self-talk” generally refers to speech directed to oneself. In a conventional sense, self-talk in public may be seen as violating social norms; however, in many interactional contexts, self-talk is not only acceptable, but contributes to mutual understanding between participants in the social encounter. Any competent member of a language community understands the underlying rules of how self-talk works, but little has been written about self-talk from interactional perspectives. In the Korean language, self-talk cannot be understood without considering linguistic features of self-talk utterances. While previous studies have identified and analyzed discourse functions of sentence enders that occur in Korean self-talk, the interactional uses of self-talk in Korean are underexplored. In order to gain a clearer picture of where, when, and how self-talk is used, this study investigates occurrences of self-talk in both private and interactional settings in data collected from reality TV shows, using conversation analytic and interactional linguistic methods. In this dataset, twenty-one different sentence enders used in self-talk (e.g., -ney, - (n)untey, -ta, -(u)nka/-na, -ci, -e/ayakeyssta, -kwuna, -e/ayaci) are observed. The analysis identifies several distinct actions carried out through self-talk, including dealing with new information, displaying stances or attitudes, talking through troubles, co-constructing future actions, managing knowledge or information, and constructing reported thought. The interactional uses of self-talk are explicated from two main theoretical perspectives, centering on participation frameworks and politeness. First, the use of self-talk can loosen up a participation framework: Self-talk places less imposition on hearers to take or respond to a turn, and less burden on speakers to choose or retain addressees while managing the complicated task of carrying on a multiparty conversation. Second, the use of self-talk helps Korean speakers&#xa0;negotiate politeness, which, in Korean, is intertwined with honorification and speech levels. The study considers how speakers manage the particular audienceship of self-talk within processes of politeness negotiation, and what drives the manipulation of speech styles and honorifics. Much remains to be explored regarding the social life of self-talk.

The study primarily investigated the role of second language experience on native-like production of L2 VOT for the Mandarin stops /p, t, k, p h , t h , k h / and additionally examined any evidence for phonetic drift in the L1 English VOT as a result of L2 Mandarin learning and acquisition. To achieve this, the production of L2 Mandarin and L1 English by native AmericanEnglish speaking learners of Mandarin of two different levels of experience (beginner and advanced learners) were compared to that of monolingual Native speakers of Mandarin and English. In total, thirty native American-English speaking learners of Mandarin, eight monolingual native Mandarin speakers, and eight monolingual American-English speakers participated in the study. Data was elicited via participants reading aloud prepared lists of Mandarin and/or English words. Statistical testing indicates that as a group beginner learners produced significantly different mean VOT than native Mandarin speakers for all six stops. In contrast, the advanced learner group’s mean VOT only significantly differed with native speakers for /t/, indicating native-like VOT for the remaining five stops. Individual analysis of VOT data for L2 Mandarin long-lag stops /p h , t h , k h / showed that advanced (7 of 15) and even some beginner (3 of 15) participants were capable of producing native-like VOT for the whole set of long-lag stops and also that a number of participants were able to produce native-like VOT for some but not all of the long-lag stops. Logistic regression analysis examining the effect and influence of L2 experience and demographic related variables indicates only gender and Mandarin-speaking church missionary service to have a significant effect on native-like VOT probability with females and returned missionaries significantly more likely to achieve native-like VOT. Analysis of learner participants’ L1 English VOT showed that for all three of the English long-lag stops (/p, t, k/), advanced learners of Mandarin produced significantly longer VOT than monolingual English speakers, indicating L1 phonetic drift in the form of assimilation towards the longer length of Mandarin long-lag stops. Significant difference was only found between beginner learner English VOT and monolingual VOT for /p/, suggesting instances of significant L1 drift increase when more L2 experience has been gained.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/influence-l2-experience-on-production-mandarin-l1/docview/2866085332/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Keppenne, Valerie",2023,"When Predictions Aren’t <em>Perfekt</em>: The Joint Roles of Prediction, Corrective Feedback, and Prediction Error in L2 Learning","In contexts of first language (L1) acquisition, prediction and adaptation are often viewed as fundamental to the learning process (Rabagliati et al., 2016). One mechanism that has been proposed to specifically account for such adaptive behavior is error-based implicit learning (e.g., Chang et al., 2006). According to this account, speakers constantly predict upcoming language input. When these predictions are not met, it leads to adjustments in the linguistic system in order to avoid future errors, i.e., speakers learn. To what extent similar mechanisms apply in L2 learning is uncertain, as the degree to which L2 learners have been shown to predict upcoming input is modulated by grammatical structure, proficiency, and other individual variables (for a review, see Kaan, 2014; Kaan &amp; Grüter, 2021). Generating fewer predictions means that opportunities for prediction error, and consequently for learning, may be compromised (Phillips &amp; Ehrenhofer, 2015). Despite this, there is evidence that learning from prediction error can occur, particularly when learners are forced to make predictions (Grüter et al., 2021). However, it is unclear whether error-based learning is possible when the target structure is novel to L2 learners, especially in lower-proficiency learners, as some baseline knowledge of the target structure may be necessary (McDonough &amp; Fulga, 2015; but see Bovolenta &amp; Marsden, 2022; Brod, 2021). Largely separate from frameworks of error-based learning, many studies investigating the differential effects of corrective feedback on L2 learning have shown that, like prediction, the effectiveness of corrective feedback can be modulated by factors such as the target structure and L2 proficiency (e.g., Ammar, 2008; Ammar &amp; Spada, 2006; Li, 2014). An understanding of how learners process feedback and compute prediction error may potentially explain why certain types of feedback are more beneficial than others, pointing towards the need to study error-based learning and corrective feedback in tandem to better understand the mechanisms underlying L2 learning. In two experiments, this dissertation unites classroom-based corrective feedback research and psycholinguistic research on predictive processing to study error-based learning in order to advance our understanding of the underlying learning mechanisms in late L2 acquisition. By encouraging learners to predict and by tracking their linguistic development, this dissertation sheds light on the role of prediction for L2 learning at different proficiencies, and how learners process feedback and use prediction errors to update their developing L2 linguistic system. Experiment 1 aimed to investigate the role of two different types of implicit feedback after prediction for the learning of German present perfect in learners of different proficiencies, since previous studies have shown both prediction and feedback effects to be modulated by target structure and learner proficiency. In German, the present perfect is formed with one of two auxiliary verbs: haben ‘to have’ is used with transitive verbs, such as essen ‘to eat’, while sein ‘to be’ is used with verbs that involve movement from A to B, such as laufen ‘to run’, or a change in state. The alternation thus has a semantic component that is difficult for L2 learners to acquire. The training task administered to participants created a context that encouraged them to engage in prediction in conjunction with receiving feedback to learn this alternation and the targeted past participles. In a pretest/posttest/delayed posttest design in a remote, web-based setup, L2 German learners ( N =46) of different proficiencies completed two training blocks in which they predicted a past action based on the auxiliary in a sentence fragment. For instance, they read Tina hat gestern Abend spät ___. ‘Tina has ___ late last night.’ and chose between two pictures that either matched or mismatched the fragment (based on the auxiliary). They then completed the sentence by typing the participle of the corresponding main verb, and received semantic- or form-focused feedback (regardless of response correctness). No explicit instruction was provided. Alongside the pre-,&#xa0;immediate, and delayed posttests, an interim test was administered between training blocks. These outcome measures included a written picture description task and a picture matching task to target production and comprehension of the present perfect. The results indicated that participants generally increased in auxiliary and participle accuracy over the course of the training, and that feedback ordering had little effect on accuracy or the trajectory of learning. The results also showed that learners of intermediate proficiency increased most in accuracy across testing times. On the other hand, analyses of auxiliary accuracy split by learners with and without prior knowledge of the target feature show that guessing — creating weak expectations based on no prior knowledge — paired with implicit feedback did not lead to significant learning. In Experiment 2, I expanded on the findings of Experiment 1 by investigating the developmental trajectory of whether and how learners predictively process the auxiliary online, how they process feedback, and how they compute prediction error online during learning. Beginning to intermediate L2 German learners ( N= 13) with previous exposure to the target structure completed a similar training task as in Experiment 1, including four training blocks with feedback. During the auditory presentation of sentence fragments during training, as well as during feedback presentation, participants’ eye movements and pupil dilation were recorded to track the emergence of predictive looks towards target pictures as well as the evolving processing of feedback and prediction error. Training was preceded by a pretest and followed by immediate and delayed posttests, including the same outcomes measures as in Experiment 1. The results showed that participants improved on productive measures of auxiliary and participle accuracy, but not on receptive measures of auxiliary accuracy, neither during training nor on the outcome measure targeting comprehension. Furthermore, the tracking of eye movements during training did not reveal the emergence of predictive looks to target images. On the other hand, the time course of the pupil response during feedback presentation did evolve over the course of the training task, and pupil responses differed depending on the correctness of learners’ predictions. Taken together, the results of these two experiments suggest that error-based learning is possible in L2 learning, albeit with some constraints related to the target linguistic feature, general L2 proficiency, and prior knowledge of the target feature. Furthermore, the importance of online predictive processing for learning in error-based learning frameworks is put into question, as learning occurred even in the absence of predictive looks during training. Finally, the usefulness of pupillometry to investigate feedback processing and its evolution over the course of a learning task is demonstrated. As such, this dissertation significantly contributes to investigations of L2 learning mechanisms and has a few pedagogical implications as well.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/when-predictions-aren-t-em-perfekt-joint-roles/docview/2866084383/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Patterson, Allie Spencer",2023,The Grounding of L1 and L2 Representations in Perceptual Experiences,"In this study, I conducted 17 experiments in which I begin bridging the gap between second language acquisition (SLA) theories and first language (L1) embodiment theories. The primary aim of this series of studies was to provide evidence for the grounding of semantic representation in perceptual experiences during second language (L2) processing as proposed by the grounded cognition hypothesis (Barsalou, 1999). A secondary aim was to provide evidence for the embodied grounding in a non-European language, L1 Japanese. The experiments, which all utilized reaction time methods, were split into three paradigms that tested for differing embodied semantic effects. In L1 research, a growing body of evidence lends credence to the hypothesis that perceptomotor experiences are the foundation of semantic representations. However, this hypothesis has yet to be widely adopted by SLA researchers. Embodiment researchers posit that the mind is situated within and inseparable from the experiences that arise from having a body that interacts with its environment. These researchers have demonstrated that body and perception manipulation affect the characteristics of cognition and vice versa. In Experiments 1 through 6, I attempted to replicate action compatibility effects (ACE) in which language affects motor control with methods first developed by Glenberg and Kaschak (2002). In this paradigm, participants responded to language that indicated motor activity. However, the speed at which they respond was hypothesized to be modulated by the semantic content of the primes. For instance, the prime I close the drawer was hypothesized to lead to a response delay if the participants were required to&#xa0;move their arm toward their body because the prime indicates a hand movement away from the body. In line with other recent ACE replications, no significant ACE was found. As such, the results of the experiments did not support the hypotheses. The lack of significant findings in these experiments was hypothesized to be due to the overwrought design of ACE experiments dependent on participants going against real world conditioning. Instead of relying on button pushes, reaction times in these experiments were dependent on participants holding and then releasing a button, which runs counter to how they interact with most electronics. In Experiments 7 through 12, I tested for visuospatial interference effects in which language affects visual perception (e.g., Bergen et al., 2007; Estes et al., 2015; Gozli et al., 2013). In these experiments, a picture priming method was employed to demonstrate that some linguistic forms are grounded in differing spatial locations relative to the human body. For instance, the written prime bird followed by a picture of a bird at an angle below the human body was hypothesized to lead to a response delay because birds are stereotypically found above humans. Significant visuospatial effects were demonstrated in L1 experiments, but not in the L2. These nonsignificant L2 findings might have been due to the greater cognitive demands of L2 processing in which intrinsic semantic features are prioritized over less intrinsic features, such as spatial location. In Experiments 13 through 17, I employed affective interference methods to test for the effects of facial mimicry on reading comprehension (Havas et al., 2007). Participants held a chopstick in their mouth while completing these experiments to&#xa0;block or facilitate facial mimicry during reading comprehension. Because the primes contained affective language, it was hypothesized that response time might be affected by the blocking or facilitation of this semantic effect. Significant affective interference effects were found in all experiments except for the single word L1 experiment. However, the coefficients in several of the experiments did not align with the hypotheses. These misaligned coefficients were hypothesized to be due to linguistic relativity with Japanese participants hypothesized to utilize affective processing differently than European populations. Overall, these experiments provide support for the hypothesis that embodied effects are constituent components of cognition. The lack of a significant finding in the L1 single word experiment might be attributable to L2 processing relying more heavily on affective processing than L1 processing or linguistic relativistic differences between English and Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/grounding-l1-l2-representations-perceptual/docview/2856654760/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Taylor, William Christopher",2023,"Language Teaching, Cultural Learning: A Textual Analysis of Cultural Representation in Japanese Textbooks","This study examines the popular Japanese textbook series Genki (Banno et al., 2011a, 2011b) looking for cultural representations of Japanese or Eurocentric ideals therein as well as if the language used reflects a prescriptivist knowledge of culture (Kubota, 2003). When one learns a target language, they learn a target culture simultaneously (Byram &amp; Morgan, 1994). Cultural knowledge shapes language use; therefore, it would be a disservice to language learners if the teaching of culture is skewed or lacking. With the spread of English and globalization, it is easy to lose one’s cultural identity in favor of that of the global lingua franca. That being said, what this study looks for specifically is if there is a dominance of Eurocentric cultural ideals and if the language used within the dialogues are affected by positivist cultural knowledge. Previous studies show common complaints among textbooks when it comes to cultural representation; things such as lack of diverse social classes, customs of target language, or favoring other cultures are issues that plague language textbooks to this day even given the attention given by scholars (Berti, 2020). Other studies have shown how this can result in a lack of communicative competence within learners, leading to them not being able to operate efficiently within a target society (Iwasaki, 2011). For the purpose of this qualitative study, I have used methods of textual analysis inspired by Fairclough (1992b) and Song (2013) to address the research questions set forth. Contrary to what was initially hypothesized, the data showed that there was no overwhelming sense of Eurocentric domination, but cultural representation within the themes was lacking. It was also found that the language used in dialogues followed a positivist and prescriptive understanding of culture; some reasons for this are explored such as post-World War II ideologies or “market ideologies.” This study explores different ways of how teachers can supplement language learning materials to instill a sense of criticality within their students. Creating new materials allows instructors to shape the curriculum in ways that they value. This serves as a call to action for language teachers to engage in critical analysis of language learning materials and to share this analysis with their students.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/language-teaching-cultural-learning-textual/docview/2845445732/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Cui, Dixuan",2020,The Effects of 3d Characters’ Facial Expressions on Student Motivation to Learn Japanese in a Game-based Environment,"Previous research has shown that student-teacher interaction is very important in motivating students to learn a second language. However, it is unclear whether facial expression, which is one of the most important components of interaction, affects in-game language learning motivation or not. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the game characters’ facial expressions would influence the learning motivation of Japanese L2 (second language) students. The researchers of this study developed four versions of a 3D animated Japanese role-playing game. Each version of the game includes characters displaying one of four different facial expression, namely neutral, happy, sad or angry. Two experiments were conducted: a validation study and a motivation study. Before the motivation study, a validation study was conducted to ask participants how realistic each facial expression was. Questionnaires using recognition, intensity, typicality and sincerity as the dependent variables were sent to participants outside of Japanese departments of Purdue and other universities. After validating all the facial expressions of five main characters in the game, 84 college students from 200/300 level Japanese courses joined in the motivation study voluntarily. They played a version of the game assigned randomly to them and then did a post-questionnaire. Conclusions were drawn based on the survey results. The findings of this research suggested that virtual characters’ facial expressions in game had no significant effect on participants’ learning motivation. However, for the factor years of learning Japanese, the significant effect was found on the variable time spent, realism for character appearance, immersion into games and interaction with characters. Meanwhile, it was found that the two factors, facial expression and years of learning Japanese, had an interactive effect on the variable immersion into games. Furthermore, significance was found in gender on the four variables learning motivation, realism for character appearance, immersion into games and attention on ingame characters. Overall, it was concluded that facial expressions did not affect the learning motivation of Japanese L2 student.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-3d-characters-facial-expressions-on/docview/2827706869/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Xu, Jingjing",2023,The Role of Grounding and Lexical Aspect in L2 Acquisition of Perfective Aspect Marker <em>-Le</em> in Chinese,"Acquisition of the perfective marker -le in Mandarin Chinese is a daunting task for second language learners. To date, there has been no consensus on what it is about -le that makes it such a challenge to learners. This study investigates the acquisition of -le from both a lexical perspective and a discourse perspective. I test two hypotheses: (1) whether the distribution of - le in lexical aspectual class, i.e., state, activity, accomplishment, and achievement, plays a role in the way L2 learners use -le , as predicted by the Aspect Hypothesis; and (2) whether the distinction in discourse between foregrounding and backgrounding plays a role in the way L2 learners use -le , as predicted by the Discourse Hypothesis. Three proficiency levels of participants participated in an oral storytelling task: Frog, Where Are You , in Chinese. The results show that both the Aspect Hypothesis and the Discourse Hypothesis are supported. All of the participants used -le to distinguish foreground and background, and they also used -le predominately with achievements. Lower-level participants differ from higher - level speakers in that they produced much less -le with bounding materials in foreground with achievement predicates. It is concluded that the challenge of acquiring -le comes from the syntactic complexity of -le with bounding materials, rather than lexical aspect or grounding.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-grounding-lexical-aspect-l2-acquisition/docview/2842672330/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tsujihara, Rie",2023,Expressing Gratitude in a Foreign Language: Concept-Based Language Instruction to Teach Thanking in L2 Japanese,"In the field of L2 pragmatics instruction, there have been calls to re-consider how L2 pragmatic competence is evaluated. L2 pragmatic competence consists of pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic knowledge. The former refers to the ability to use linguistic items to realize speech intentions, while the latter refers to the knowledge of the appropriate selection and usage of language in accordance with social conventions. L2 learners’ pragmatic competence is usually assessed based on L2 learners’ pragmalinguistic choices in comparison to native speaker data. In other words, L2 learners are expected to produce the target L2 pragmatic features in the same way as native speakers do. In reality, there are variations in native speakers’ pragmatic choices, and native speaker data do not capture the diversity of native speaker choices and pragmatic behavior. In the foreign language classroom, pragmatics materials are often developed based on the writer’s or teacher’s intuitions, and the full meaning of sociopragmatic information is not adequately provided. This may risk creating a sense of “this is how people behave in the target culture” and simply following native speaker norms without cultivating a way for L2 speakers to fully express themselves. Extensive reliance on native speaker norms also ignores L2 learners’ agency and personal pragmatic choices. Sometimes, L2 learners refuse to conform to L2 norms when the norms do not accord with their identities, beliefs, and personalities. Resisting L2 norms does not always mean a lack of L2 competence. Other times, L2 learners find a creative way to supplement the lack of their proficiency and make pragmatic choices different from the L2 norm. However, their L2 pragmatic competence is considered to be “problematic,” if they do not follow these norms. These learners may possess proper sociopragmatic knowledge but intentionally select different pragmalinguistic choices from L2 norms. Assessing L2 pragmatic competence based on native speaker norms risks overlooking L2 learners’ subtle development that is not related to native speaker norms.	 This dissertation explores a novel way to teach L2 pragmatics through concept-based language instruction (C-BLI), grounded in L.S. Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory of cognitive development. Vygotsky claimed that systematic and abstract knowledge, which he called scientific concepts, can be applied to a wide range of situations and raise the likelihood of successful task completion. Derived from Vygotsky’s claim, C-BLI aims to develop L2 learners’ pragmatic competence by first teaching scientific metapragmatic concepts and the meaning potential of language. Bringing language socialization theory into the C-BLI unit, the present study focuses on the speech act of thanking in Japanese and promoting the internalization of metapragmatic concepts. Through the analysis of various internalization tasks, the study examines (1) the development of learner production; (2) the development of sociopragmatic conceptual understanding; (3) the impact of language socialization opportunities; (4) the development of L2 learner agency; (5) the proper proficiency level for the C-BLI unit; and (6) the impact of language proficiency. The results show development in understanding scientific concepts of the target pragmatic feature and abilities to perform the target speech act. The development was promoted by various mediational means, including instructional materials and language socialization opportunities. I also found that the development of sociopragmatic knowledge provided L2 learners with tools to make pragmatic choices that achieve their communicative goals. Both third- and fourth-year learners benefitted from the C-BLI unit. Third-year learners benefitted more in concept development and less in the development of pragmalinguistic skills, while fourth-year learners benefitted in both sociopragmatic concept development and in their ability to use a range of thanking strategies and expressions in Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/expressing-gratitude-foreign-language-concept/docview/2838166367/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Liu, Yang",2023,Let's Go! Learning Chinese With a Place-Based Mobile Game,"This dissertation responds to Wagner’s (2015) proposal to systematically design social infrastructures to support second language (L2) learning and use “in the wild” (Hutchins, 1995). My research began with the creation of a place-based augmented reality (AR) mobile game (cf. Holden &amp; Sykes, 2011; Thorne et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2018), 我们走吧 (“Let’s Go!”) and its implementation in the curricular context of a Chinese as a Second Language (CSL) program at Peking University. The game aligns with textbook materials and extends them into gaming activities around two categories of places on campus: everyday activity hubs (e.g., cafeterias, gyms) and culturally-significant sites (e.g., Boya Tower, Weiming Lake). 我们走吧 (“Let’s Go!”) was designed to dynamically augment classroom learning with the “vibrancy of linguistically and experientially rich engagement” (Thorne et al., 2021, p. 108) in the virtual-physical and social-material worlds. Building on recent advancements in Multimodal Conversation Analysis (Mondada, 2019) focusing on mobility (Haddington et al., 2013), temporality (Deppermann &amp; Streeck, 2018) and engagement with objects in interaction (Nevile et al., 2014), this study investigates how CSL students navigate in the game and real world and cooperatively accomplish diverse place-based gaming activities. The students’ gameplay sessions were video recorded during a seven-week course. The analysis focuses on three recurrent activities: collaborative reading of the game’s instructions and dialogues, approaching local passers-by for participation in the game, and knowing and experiencing places through community-engaging social interactions. The findings show that students managed multiple digital devices (e.g., the game device, students’ personal smartphones) simultaneously as a group to accomplish game tasks. The “togetherness” (Lehn, 2013) was particularly salient when students coordinated their actions to move from one place to another on campus. Furthermore, students tracked specific linguistic resources as learning objects (Markee, 2008), such as the pronunciation, the Chinese character form, and the interpretation of lexical items in the game text. Finally, students show development of increasingly diversified linguistic and semiotic resources (Pekarek Doehler &amp; Pochon-Berger, 2015) used in formatting actions such as self-introduction and activity-explanation over the seven-week course. This dissertation presents a model for the design, development, and institutional implementation of a mobile AR game and expands the horizon of CA-informed game-based L2 learning and interactions in the digital wilds (Sauro &amp; Zourou, 2019).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/lets-go-learning-chinese-with-place-based-mobile/docview/2835402687/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Dai, Dexin",2023,An Investigation in Acquiring Chinese Relative Clauses by Advanced Chinese L2 Learners,"The present study was focused on acquisition of Chinese relative clauses (RCs) by second language (L2) learners and whether this acquisition was influenced by RC linguistic features, learners’ Chinese proficiency levels, and their first language (L1). Data were gathered via a Chinese reading comprehension test, a grammaticality judgment task, a sentence combination task, a sentence formation task, and post-task interviews.&#xa0; An analysis of 46 Chinese learners’ and 22 native speakers’ performances on these tasks and 15 learners’ perspectives from the interviews revealed that the acquisition of RCs was challenging for learners, particularly with the use of the RC marker de . Furthermore, the types of RC and Chinese proficiency levels significantly impacted the learners’ acquisition of RCs. The results indicated that learners could comprehend both subject RCs (SRCs) and object RCs (ORCs) with comparable accuracy, but they produced more correct sentences with ORCs than with SRCs. Additionally, learners’ L1 influenced their acquisition of Chinese RCs, which was evident from the errors made with de as an RC marker and the production of Chinese RCs with English word order. The interview data confirmed that learners’ perceptions of Chinese RCs played a role in the L1 transfer effect on their acquisition. The results of the current study have implications for teaching Chinese RCs and suggest the need for frequent input on RCs in classroom instruction. Task-based language teaching activities and multimodal input can provide more meaningful and engaging input to learners and improve their accuracy and fluency in using RCs. Explicit instruction to explain the syntactic features of RCs to learners is also recommended. RC instruction should start with SRC and then proceed to ORC. Teachers are encouraged to communicate with students about their perceptions&#xa0;of the differences and similarities between RCs in their L1 and the target language to further analyze their errors and learning strategies.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigation-acquiring-chinese-relative-clauses/docview/2833521810/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Dickerson, Sydney",2023,Second Language Discourse Markers and Study Abroad: the Case of Pues and Bueno in Peninsular Spanish,"This investigation examined the effectiveness of different types of explicit classroom instruction on second language (L2) development of the Spanish discourse marker (DM) pues. While several studies have addressed the positive effect of explicit instruction on L2 DM development, the current investigation moves beyond the explicit-implicit method debate by examining the comparative effectiveness of different types of explicit instruction, specifically by comparing the effects of concept-based instruction (CBI), rule-based instruction (RBI), and a control group (CTRL). This investigation contributes to the field of instructed pragmatics by demonstrating how different types of explicit instruction can affect the robustness of pragmatics learning outcomes. Furthermore, with the inclusion of CBI, this investigation expands theoretical paradigms for L2 pragmatics teaching to include a less explored framework for instruction — sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 1987). Given the learnability problem posed by the low perceptual salience and extensive multifunctionality of DMs, along with their conceptual connections to important interactional practices and to a semantic core that guides their use in discourse, DMs and pues specifically were identified as a potentially ideal candidate for development through CBI. Pues is translated in English to ‘so’, ‘then’, ‘cos’, and ‘well’ and is a highly frequent feature of Spanish conversation (Domínguez García, 2016; Stenström, 2006a; Stenström, 2006b). DMs like pues contribute to speakers’ ability to communicate effectively and participate in social interaction (Crible &amp; Pascual, 2020; Hayano, 2011; Hoshi, 2017; Thörle, 2016) and, thus, they are important linguistic features for L2 speakers. Using a pre, post, and delayed post design, data were collected using an oral decisionmaking task and a dialogue reflection task. The analyses addressed whether CBI, RBI, and CTRL produce the same effect on L2 Spanish learners’ pues frequency of use, pues functional range, and use of pues in interaction. As a secondary objective, the analyses also considered whether CBI and RBI produce the same effect on L2 Spanish learners’ ability to transfer learning to unlearned DMs. Quantitative analyses, which addressed the learners’ ability to use pues frequently and for a range of functions, indicated an advantage for the CBI group, with CBI learners using pues with greater frequency of use and functional range than RBI and CTRL learners. The qualitative analysis, which addressed the learners’ ability to use pues in interaction, also indicated an advantage for the CBI group, with CBI learners using pues to express a stance of givenness towards utterances as well as to manage turn-taking in interaction. CBI learners’ use of pues for accomplishing these two interactional practices indicated a deeper understanding of pues and how the DM can be used to accomplish social actions in interaction. Overall, the findings provide support for the claim that CBI is superior to traditional explicit models of instruction (Erikson, Lanning, &amp; French, 2017) and suggest that the learnability problem of DMs may be lessened by providing a conceptual structure that presents learners with a framework for organizing DM multifunctionality and that also highlights the interactional importance of DMs as tools that can be used to accomplish social actions. The findings are discussed considering the role of conceptual knowledge in L2 DM development and implications for pragmatics instruction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-discourse-markers-study-abroad/docview/2827704234/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kloske, Madelyn E.",2023,Developing Pragmatic Competence with Discourse Marker Instruction: A Single-Case Design,"This thesis presents original research aimed at understanding the impacts of second language acquisition (SLA) informed instruction (i.e., implicit versus explicit approaches) on the subsequent use of DMs (i.e., you know and I mean ) by L2 speakers ( n =4) of English enrolled in an intensive English-language program (IELP) in the United States. The study follows a single-case multiple-treatment design (SCD) wherein all individuals underwent two stages of treatment and provided their own controls (baseline frequency measurement) to which the experimental effects are compared. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from the transcriptions of a recorded series of cross-cultural communication sessions whereby undergraduate first language (L1) English-speaking American conversation partners engaged in interactional discourse. The frequency data revealed internal variable effects of instruction with more immediate positive effects following the explicit treatment but more durable effects during the implicit treatment phase. Through a discourse analysis of one case in which the frequencies of DMs were markedly higher throughout the experiment, individual differences were revealed which corroborated previous findings indicating that variables such as proficiency level, language learning goals, and intensity of interaction in the L2 can moderate impacts of instruction, though in unexpected ways. Pedagogical implications of the findings are offered, and suggestions for future research steps are provided.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/developing-pragmatic-competence-with-discourse/docview/2826072024/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lidster, Ryan",2023,Investigating Whether Discriminability Predicts Lexical Encoding Accuracy for American English Learners of Phonemic Length in Second Language Japanese,"When acquiring a second language, learners must become able to perceive the difference between novel sounds (“discrimination”) and also associate strings of sounds with distinct vocabulary items (“lexical encoding”). Recent research has questioned whether discrimination is a sufficient or necessary condition for encoding, and Japanese length is of particular relevance to this question because of the large number of contrasts distinguished primarily by duration. For example, koko, kooko, kokko, kokoo, kookoo, and kokkoo are six distinct, unrelated nouns, and while previous studies have shown that learners are able to detect differences between at least some forms, length-related errors in word recognition and production remain highly frequent, even for advanced learners. Therefore, modeling these error patterns is of key interest to teachers and researchers, but current models of L2 perception do not yet account for phonemic length. This study examines the performance of 30 American English-speaking learners of Japanese and 10 native speakers on an Oddity discrimination task, two lexical encoding tasks (picture-word matching and forced-choice lexical decision), and a Free Classification and Identification task to model patterns of confusion across a variety of length-related contrasts. For discrimination, vowel contrasts in initial position were easier than consonant length contrasts, and Free Classification and Identification results patterned very closely with discrimination performance, showing that these tasks are viable for modeling discriminability, even for non-segmental features. For lexical encoding, the most difficult contrasts in discrimination were similarly at near chance levels for lexical encoding, suggesting that a baseline level of discrimination is needed. Overall, there were moderate, significant correlations between discrimination and lexical encoding tasks, but the encoding tasks were much more closely related to each other than to discrimination, providing convergent and divergent evidence that the two constructs are measurably separable. For encoding, non-word competitors of the “all-short” form were much more difficult to reject compared to stimuli that had spurious long segments. These results line up with previous research on other languages to show how lexical encoding is hierarchical. In sum, the results support the interpretation that lexical encoding, while related to discrimination, is a separable construct.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigating-whether-discriminability-predicts/docview/2826010034/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Dinh, Truong My Hanh",2023,Synergic Concepts and Lexical Idiosyncrasies as Means of Reconceptualization to Develop Bilingual Pragmatic Competence: A Study of Sequential Bilingual Students in Different Sociocultural Contexts,"This dissertation uses the Conceptual Blending Hypothesis from the socio-cognitive method presented and refined by Kecskes (2002, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2020) to explain how the lexical choice of bilinguals differs across sociocultural situations. Quantitative (lexical density, lexical diversity, and lexical sophistication) and qualitative (lexical concepts) processes demonstrate this variance. Hence, the thesis shows the interplay between two aspects of the bilingual’s word choice, namely conceptualizing and selecting words in the linguistic system, which influence word choice in context (i.e. individual words via words used in essay writing). It is hypothesized that a conceptual blending of the sociocultural loads of the first language and those of the second language (L2) during the conceptualization process influences the formulation and selection of lexical items or words in a target context. 108 students participated in this study, including 72 sequential Chinese-English students from two parallel classrooms at institutions located in the Northeast of the United States and China. In addition, 36 English native-speaking students studying in the same program in the USA were recruited as a baseline group. Ten socioculturally distinct concepts were selected for a conceptual elicitation task (containing [1] individual concept’s semantic elicitation, [2] pragmatic contextual and emotional elicitation, and [3] word associations) and an essay employing those concepts and their lexicalized words in English. Data analysis also shows that conceptual blending in synergic concepts can display varied degrees of blending that may affect on-time lexical selection in the actual situational context, which could result in a “third-space” conceptualization and deviational idiosyncratic word choices. The key findings are as follows: (1) during conceptualization (pre-verbal messages), conceptual blending in synergic concepts was detected in all experimental concepts, starting with domineering L1 socio-cultural conceptualization, through dominantly assimilating into L2 conceptualization to deviational conceptualization from both L1 and L2 conceptualization; (2) the locations where the conceptual socialization takes place (using English as a foreign language in native culture versus English as a second language in the target culture) weakly affects or does not affect the reconceptualization of a concept at all; (3) in formulation (formulator), under the influence of synergic concepts, the cognitive saliency of word sequences of two bilingual groups deviates from each other, and the monolingual groups; (4) at the phase of articulation (articulator) in essay writing, pre-verbal synergic concepts (conceptualizer and formulator) are lexicalized into natural collocations or lexical idiosyncrasies that are prominent in the conceptual socialization of bilinguals living in the target L2 culture. These idiosyncrasies are lexicalized from their synergic concepts and stronger conceptual blending when conceptually blending into the target culture. Indeed, bilinguals in the USA have statistically significantly more lexical idiosyncrasies than subjects in China. Furthermore, due to the fact that their lexical density, diversity, and sophistication are comparable to those of monolingual Americans, typical lexical complexities do not distinguish bilingual students in the United States from monolingual Americans, as they do in bilinguals living in China, while lexical idiosyncrasies could be included to help depict their lexical abilities. (5) Lastly, lexical density, diversity, and lexical idiosyncrasies may be utilized together to highlight lexical complexity and differentiate bilingual subjects in terms of their bilingual pragmatic competence, although text lengths and lexical sophistication cannot. Individual characteristics, such as metapragmatic awareness and holistic translanguaging in conceptualization and lexicalization, might guide bilingual students’ lexical choices towards a specific audience. The study provides novel insights into the dynamics involved in bilingual language usage and bilingual pragmatic competence, as demonstrated by the conceptual and linguistic evolution of bilingual learners’ vocabularies as represented by word selection. The pedagogical implications of the study are also addressed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/synergic-concepts-lexical-idiosyncrasies-as-means/docview/2806798081/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Alhammad, Albandary",2022,The Effect of Explicit Instruction on Developing Appropriate Spoken Pragmatic Language Choices in Female Saudi Arabian English as a Foreign Language Students,"This study assessed the effects of providing explicit pragmatic instruction on the development of spoken pragmatic competence as exhibited in the understanding and production of appropriate spoken pragmatic language choices. The intervention in the study was conducted in an English as a foreign language (EFL) context with students studying/using English for academic purposes in a non-English environment (Saudi Arabia). Specifically, the study focused on the understanding and production of specific appropriate pragmatic language choices; i) conversational implicatures, ii) politeness strategies, iii) direct/indirect requests, along with iv) a number of appropriate formulaic expressions. The data was collected from 70 Saudi female participants who were at B1(CFER) level learning English as a foreign language EFL in the English department at a Saudi university. The study employed an experimental design, comparing the results of an experimental group, which received ten hours of explicit interventional instruction, and a control group, whose members did not receive instruction. The instruction focused on appropriate language choices in using English language, in particular, the understanding and production of pragmatically appropriate language choices in common conversational contexts that they may encounter in their everyday academic life. This included a focus on the understanding of conversational implicatures, including how to understand cooperative principles and their maxims; politeness strategies, including direct or indirect politeness, and the production of speech acts focusing on direct and indirect requests and explicitly introducing some common formulaic expressions. Performance was measured based on a pre-, post-, and delayed tests designed using a Computer-Animated Production Task (CAPT). The data were collected using two methods: i) a production task to assess the production of appropriate pragmatic language choices of direct and indirect requests and formulaic sequences, and ii) a recognition task to assess the appropriate understanding of conversational implicatures and politeness strategies. The effects of instruction were measured (i) immediately after instruction and (ii) four weeks after instruction to examine the immediate influence and changes over time. The results showed that explicit instruction facilitated the development of pragmatically appropriate language choices in the experimental group, which performed significantly better than the control group in both the post- and the delayed tests. The study demonstrates that explicit instruction to develop pragmatic competence can be effective.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-explicit-instruction-on-developing/docview/2800163280/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Victoria, Lai Weisong",2022,Efficacy of Aphasia Intervention in Mandarin: Case Study Evaluation of Two Treatment Approaches for Mandarin-English Bilinguals,"More than half the world’s population speaks more than one language but despite increased interest in the rehabilitation of bilinguals with aphasia (BWAs), three critical gaps in treatment research remain. Firstly, the lack of diversity in language pairs studied precludes extending conclusions on generalisation to other types of bilinguals. In particular, there is a dearth of research on Mandarin, one of the most widely spoken languages, and one which is very different from English. Secondly, the application of findings from extant studies has been impeded by the extensive heterogeneity amongst BWAs and warrants more comprehensive assessment of language abilities. Thirdly, the predominant treatment approach has been impairment-based with most earlier studies targeting nouns at the single-word level. However, the linguistic salience of verbs suggests they could better facilitate generalisation and be more appropriate for verb-friendly languages like Mandarin. Moreover, conversation-based approaches at the phrase/sentence level, more closely resembling everyday communication, might be more effective in achieving the ultimate goal of improved functional communication. The aim of this thesis was to address these gaps. Two treatment studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an impairment-based approach targeting verbs, the Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST), and a conversation-based approach targeting functional communication, Better Conversations with Aphasia (BCA), conducted in Mandarin. Generalisation effects across languages at various linguistic levels were examined. To obtain a detailed profile of participants’ proficiency in both English and Mandarin, the Comprehensive Aphasia Test was adapted for Singapore Mandarin (SMACAT) by considering two aspects of Mandarin – verbdominance and tonal structure. The SMACAT performance of healthy adults was significantly different from that of persons with aphasia on all five composite scores. A single-subject experimental design was then used to evaluate the efficacy of VNeST and BCA in Mandarin. Changes in both Mandarin and English were assessed at several linguistic levels (conversation, narrative and single-word production), functional communication, and emotional wellbeing. Each participant (three each for VNeST and BCA) received a total of 10-weeks of treatment with twice-weekly 1-1.5hr sessions. Outcome measures were administered prior to treatment, immediately after (post treatment), and one month after treatment (post-maintenance). All participants showed varying but widespread patterns of generalisation suggesting that both treatments administered in Mandarin are effective. Analyses of generalisation patterns at the different linguistic levels revealed that while language proficiency was not influential, aphasia severity and cognitive factors impacted on outcomes. Two participants completed VNeST and BCA in opposite sequential order. Both benefitted after each treatment, regardless of the order. Furthermore, their changes in language abilities suggest that the two treatments complement each other as theoretically expected – VNeST facilitated greater generalisation in the treated language and at lower linguistic levels while BCA had a greater impact in the untreated language and communication-focused outcomes. Critical issues regarding codeswitching, cultural factors and tele-rehabilitation also surfaced. The findings contribute to evidence-based practice for aphasia treatments in Mandarin for BWAs and have important clinical implications in treatment planning and administration.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/efficacy-aphasia-intervention-mandarin-case-study/docview/2787197139/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Patterson, Kyle",2022,"Understanding the Modern Language Student: Where Spectator and Actor Meet in the Theater, in Front of the Screen, and in the L2 Classroom","This dissertation is to explore the academic efficacy and relevance of two comparatively new technologies, video games and Virtual Reality (VR), how they relate to an older cultural phenomenon, theater, and how a discussion of both topics can result in a better understanding of how to supply students in the classroom with the chance to improve various aspects of their L2 acquisition. Examples of these improved aspects within the field of SLA are more often associated with things like vocabulary and grammar. In fact, this has been an extremely popular direction to go in since games were first brought to language classrooms (vocabulary in particular). Aside from lexical and grammatical gains due to gamification, though, there are other aspects to be improved like students’ sense of identification, their ability to interact with narratives, their various forms of engagement, and their sense of immersion within the classroom space. This dissertation will help to move the discussion of gaming in this other direction. This project aims to provide and detail an alternative to those looking for a technologically and/or theatrically relevant or game-based teaching method to support students’ language learning; Digital Game Based Language Learning (DGBLL), a subfield of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL), prizes and plays with various concepts that have come naturally to theater for centuries (e.g., contextualization and verisimilitude), while simultaneously extending a hand toward those who are technologically inclined or interested in incorporating gameful or theatrical tactics in their classroom.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/understanding-modern-language-student-where/docview/2787127079/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Xu, Shimeng",2022,Memory Systems Modulate Crosslinguistic Influence on Third Language Morphosyntactic Acquisition,"Past investigations of the crosslinguistic influence (CLI) on third language (L3) acquisition, particularly those focused on morphosyntax, have provided empirical evidence for competing theories about the source(s) and ramifications of CLI. Some were in support of a cumulative influence from both first and second languages (L1 and L2) while others argued for either L1 or L2 being the s ole source of CLI. In cases where both L1 and L2 were deemed transferrable to L3, further examination of their distinct effects on L3 acquisition was lacking. The present project aimed to test if both L1 and L2 can be the source of CLI and to reveal if the y influence L3 learning in similar or different ways. In addition, we aimed to fill the gap in our knowledge of the neural correlates of L1/L2 CLI by conducting a neuroimaging experiment to demonstrate how L1 and L2 CLI affect L3 neural processing.&#xa0; In this project, we systematically review ed past works on CLI (Chapter 2) and conducted an empirical study to explore the transferability of L1 (Cantonese) and L2 (English) to L3 (Korean) by studying the acquisition of three morphosyntactic structures: 1) the shared pastL1L3 shared prenominal adjectival marker (ADJ), 2) the L2 tense inflection (Verb) and 3) L3unique nominative-- L3 accusative case marking (Case). Predictions by the D/P model, which posited that L1 grammar is stored as implicit knowledge in the procedural memory while L2 grammar is sustained in the declarative memory as explicit knowledge, were tested with a web behavioural experiment, and the neurocognitive underpinnings of L1and L2-- based sourced CLI were explored with the application of EEG. Findings of the web-based behavioural task (Chapter 3) confirmed that both L1 and L2 have a similarity-driven facilitative influence on L3 morphosyntactic acquisition but function differently in relation to learners’ implicit and explicit L3 knowledge, L1 facilitation contributes to native-like explicit L3 knowledge and early-on proceduralization of L3 grammar. EEG results (Chapter 4) revealed learners’ nativelike online processing of the L1-shared structure, indicating that the facilitative L1-sourced CLI led to early internalization of L3 grammar. In contrast, the L2-sourced CLI displayed no modulating effect on learners’&#xa0;brain response during L3 processing. The EEG findings attested to the distinct neural mechanisms of L1 and L2 influence on L3 acquisition. Taken together, our findings support predictions of the D/P model. Interestingly, while L1 CLI led to both enhanced implicit knowledge and nativelike brain processing of L3, L2 CLI affected neither.&#xa0;This could be explained by an association between the recruitment of procedural memory and the ERP marker (i.e., P600) for native-like processing.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/memory-systems-modulate-crosslinguistic-influence/docview/2771132845/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Dickerson, Sydney",2023,Second Language Discourse Marker Development: A Concept-Based Approach to Instruction,"This investigation examined the effectiveness of different types of explicit classroom instruction on second language (L2) development of the Spanish discourse marker (DM) pues. While several studies have addressed the positive effect of explicit instruction on L2 DM development, the current investigation moves beyond the explicit-implicit method debate by examining the comparative effectiveness of different types of explicit instruction, specifically by comparing the effects of concept-based instruction (CBI), rule-based instruction (RBI), and a control group (CTRL). This investigation contributes to the field of instructed pragmatics by demonstrating how different types of explicit instruction can affect the robustness of pragmatics learning outcomes. Furthermore, with the inclusion of CBI, this investigation expands theoretical paradigms for L2 pragmatics teaching to include a less explored framework for instruction — sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 1987). Given the learnability problem posed by the low perceptual salience and extensive multifunctionality of DMs, along with their conceptual connections to important interactional practices and to a semantic core that guides their use in discourse, DMs and pues specifically were identified as a potentially ideal candidate for development through CBI. Pues is translated in English to ‘so’, ‘then’, ‘cos’, and ‘well’ and is a highly frequent feature of Spanish conversation (Domínguez García, 2016; Stenström, 2006a; Stenström, 2006b). DMs like pues contribute to speakers’ ability to communicate effectively and participate in social interaction (Crible &amp; Pascual, 2020; Hayano, 2011; Hoshi, 2017; Thörle, 2016) and, thus, they are important linguistic features for L2 speakers. Using a pre, post, and delayed post design, data were collected using an oral decisionmaking task and a dialogue reflection task. The analyses addressed whether CBI, RBI, and CTRL produce the same effect on L2 Spanish learners’ pues frequency of use, pues functional range, and use of pues in interaction. As a secondary objective, the analyses also considered whether CBI and RBI produce the same effect on L2 Spanish learners’ ability to transfer learning to unlearned DMs. produce the same effect on L2 Spanish learners’ ability to transfer learning to unlearned DMs. Quantitative analyses, which addressed the learners’ ability to use pues frequently and for a range of functions, indicated an advantage for the CBI group, with CBI learners using pues with greater frequency of use and functional range than RBI and CTRL learners. The qualitative analysis, which addressed the learners’ ability to use pues in interaction, also indicated an advantage for the CBI group, with CBI learners using pues to express a stance of givenness towards utterances as well as to manage turn-taking in interaction. CBI learners’ use of pues for accomplishing these two interactional practices indicated a deeper understanding of pues and how the DM can be used to accomplish social actions in interaction. Overall, the findings provide support for the claim that CBI is superior to traditional explicit models of instruction (Erikson, Lanning, &amp; French, 2017) and suggest that the learnability problem of DMs may be lessened by providing a conceptual structure that presents learners with a framework for organizing DM multifunctionality and that also highlights the interactional importance of DMs as tools that can be used to accomplish social actions. The findings are discussed considering the role of conceptual knowledge in L2 DM development and implications for pragmatics instruction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-discourse-marker-development/docview/2838440281/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Guerra, Kathleen Sigrid",2020,Contact-Induced Request Softening in Northern Andean Spanish: Linguistic Ideologies in Perception and Practice,"This investigation explores the origins, perception and use of the northern Andean Spanish (CAE) dialectal construction dar + gerund, most often classified as a manner to convey a polite request or favor. It forms part of a handful of similar construction that combine a non-standard auxiliary verb (such as dar “give”, mandar “send”, pasar “pass”) with a gerund and an optional clitic, i.e. dame explicando (“give me explaining”). These variations are not found in standard or other varieties of Spanish, and historically correspond to pragmatic and syntactic transfer from Ecuadorian Kichwa (Haboud, 1998, 2003; Lipski, 2013; Muysken, 2005). 	While previous studies (Niño-Murcia, 1995; Hurley, 1995a, 1995b; Haboud 1998, 2003; Lipski, 2013; Olbertz, 2002, 2008) have investigated the origins and varieties of dar +gerund in bilingual and monolingual CAE speakers, few (Carvajal, 2016; García, forthcoming; Haboud &amp; Palacios, 2017) have addressed pragmatic constraints and use. Therefore, the first paper in this investigation reviews relevant literature on the origins and uses of dar + gerund and other non-standard auxiliaries as evidence of grammaticalization and complexification the context of language contact. This sets the backdrop in the second and third papers for the examination of how dar + gerund is perceived as a defining feature of the CAE speech community in computer mediated discourse (CMC) and in the context of personal, transactional and professional relationships. 	By examining the perception of appropriate use, this investigation shows how dialectal constructions (and language in general) encode a range of social meaning. In addition, it demonstrates how a simple definition of politeness is insufficient to describe appropriate pragmatic performance in the context of a request. Instead, appropriate request performance is derived from a complex interpretation of relationship type, context and social distance.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/contact-induced-request-softening-northern-andean/docview/2413009267/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Pp. ix +233. £49.90 cloth, £22.95 paper. This volume is a festschrift in honor of Hugo Baetens Beardsmore on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday and the twentieth anniversary of the publication of his book Bilingualism: Basic principles (1982). The volume includes 12 articles in addition to an introduction and a laudatio. The volume reflects the important developments of studies in bilingualism in the last 20 years and covers a great variety of areas related to the sociolinguistic, educational, and psycholinguistic dimensions of bilingualism. The first chapter is a reprint of one of Baetens Beardsmore's lesser known publications (1988) and discusses the fears of bilingualism at different levels. Fifteen years later, this chapter still addresses the most important issues related to bilingualism often discussed by teachers, parents, and policy makers. The next three chapters focus on the social aspects of bilingualism: Edwards discusses bilingualism and identity in chapter 2, Clyne addresses the role of intrinsic motivation and metalinguistic awareness in bilingualism in chapter 3, and Cummins examines the differences between the criticism against bilingual education in the American press and the positive results of research on the outcomes of bilingualism in chapter 4. These three chapters each have a different focus but taken together provide an interesting perspective of the social factors affecting bilingualism. Chapter 5 by Martin and chapter 7 by Jones discuss multilingual education in Brunei. These two chapters describe the languages used in schools, the educational context, and the most recent changes in education in Brunei and could be of interest for educators in other bilingual contexts. Chapter 6 by Baker and chapter 8 by Wei and Milroy both discuss language and society but focus on minority languages in two completely different settings—Wales and Singapore. Both chapters discuss interesting theoretical aspects that are then applied to specific settings. Chapter 9 (Fraser Gupta) has a very weak link to the rest of the chapters in the book and analyzes seven self-study books of Malay from different periods. Chapter 10 (Lüdi) and chapter 11 (Myers-Scotton) discuss interesting theoretical aspects of codeswitching, and the last chapter (Genesee) focuses on the similarities and differences between early monolingual and bilingual acquisition. These three chapters are more research oriented than the rest of the chapters in the book, both because of their theoretical basis and the empirical data they discuss. They may also be the most interesting for researchers in SLA.",,10.1017/S0272263105280051,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263105280051,ancestry

B. Vanpatten,1996.0,Input Processing and Grammar Instruction in Second Language Acquisition,"This book provides an alternative to the ""grammar debate"" in second language acquisition theory and teaching. Accepting that language acquisition is at least partially input dependent, the author asks how grammatical form is processed in the input by second language learners and is it possible to assist this in ways that help the learner to create richer grammatical intake. He answers these questions and explains why traditional paradigms are not psycholinguistically motivated. Drawing on research from both first and second language acquisition, he outlines a model for input processing in second language acquisition that helps to account for how learners construct grammatical systems. He then uses this model to motivate ""processing instruction,"" a type of grammar instruction in which learners are engaged in making form-meaning connections during particular input activities.",,10.2307/345093,https://doi.org/10.2307/345093,ancestry

The second section surveys research into tasks, covering the different perspectives (interactional, cognitive) which have been influential. Then a third section explores how performance on tasks has been measured, generally in terms of how complex the language used is, how accurate it is, and how fluent. There is also discussion of approaches to measuring interaction. A fourth section explores the pedagogic and interventionist dimension of the use of tasks.

Adopting a pretest/posttest design as with treatment and control group, the two groups in this study were exposed to the treatment. Data collected by means of written Discourse Completion Test (DCT) as well as written self report suggest that the instructional approach resulted in gain in L2 pragmatic ability of the experimental group. The delayed posttest used in the study confirmed the findings. The findings may contribute to the interlanguage pragmatic pedagogy, especially in the EFL context and suggest that meta-pragmatic information the L2 learners received through pedagogy may lead to learners' L2 pragmatic development.",,10.4304/JLTR.3.4.814-821,https://doi.org/10.4304/JLTR.3.4.814-821,ancestry

"M. Swain, Sharon Lapkin",2001.0,Focus on form through collaborative dialogue: Exploring task effects,"In our recent research we have been using tasks as a stimulus for generating talk among students (Swain and Lapkin, 1998). We have been interested in discovering whether, through output (the activities of talking and/or writing), learners notice gaps in their linguistic knowledge, triggering an analysis of input or of existing internal resources to fill those gaps (Swain and Lapkin, 1995); whether learners' output serves as a hypothesis of how to convey their intended meaning (Swain, 1995); and whether learners use language to reflect on their own (or their interlocutors') language use that is, whether learners externalise their hypotheses about form and meaning, exposing those hypotheses to scrutiny and discussion (Swain, 1998; 2000). Our research has involved a search for tasks that will generate this sort of student talk with the goal of demonstrating its relationship to second language learning. The tasks we have used to generate such talk engage students in linguistic problem solving, are done collaboratively, and involve the production of a spoken and written text. Studies such as those of Donate (1994), LaPierre (1994; see also Swain, 1998), Swain and Lapkin (1998) and Tse (1996) suggest that the talk which surfaces when students collaborate in solving linguistic problems encountered m communicative task performance represents second language learning in progress. In these studies, later language use has been traced back to dialogue occurring as the students worked collaboratively to express their intended meaning and carry out the task at hand. In these dialogic exchanges related to their ongoing language use, noticing, hypothesis formulation, and hypothesis testing have been observed to have taken place. These studies have relied on pedagogical tasks to serve as the stimulus to collaborative dialogue (Swain, 1997a). One of the main rationales offered in the literature for using communicative tasks in language teaching is that second language acquisition is enhanced through the negotiation of meaning: '. . . language learning is assisted through the social interaction of learners and their interlocutors, particularly when they Negotiate toward mutual comprehension of each other's message meaning'",,10.4324/9781315838267-14,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315838267-14,ancestry
"Kristine Billmyer, Manka M. Varghese",2000.0,Investigating instrument-based pragmatic variability: effects of enhancing discourse completion tests,"A significant dilemma in sociolinguistic research concerns the methods used to collect data, the validity of different types of data and, '…their adequacy to approximate the authentic performance of linguistic action' (Kasper and Dahl 1991: 215). Manes and Wolfson (1981) claimed that the most authentic data in sociolinguistic research is spontaneous speech gathered by ethnographic observation. Difficulties in relying on this method are well-documented (Blum-Kulka et al. 1989, Aston 1995) and have led to the wide use of an elicitation procedure known as the discourse completion test (DCT). Justified criticisms have been levelled at the DCT, some labelling it an instrument that limits the capturing of authentic communication, and others making it look almost obsolete. However, there are to date no other sociolinguistic data collection instruments that have as many administrative advantages as the DCT, making it, practically speaking, a resource pragmatics testing and teaching will continue to rely on. Furthermore, a better understanding of communication in such a constructed context may help us gain a better understanding of authentic communication. This study investigates the effect of systematic modification to DCT situational prompts used to elicit requests on the responses of native and non-native speakers of English. Modification included enhancing the situational prompts by adding information on a number of social and contextual variables considered relevant to this study. Results indicate that enhancement did not affect the request strategy or amount of internal modification. However, enhancing situational prompts did produce significantly longer, more elaborated requests in both groups. These findings point to the importance of external modification of speech act production and the need for an instrument that can satisfactorily account for both variation and context. This study has implications for both teaching and testing in interlanguage pragmatics.",,10.1093/APPLIN/21.4.517,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/21.4.517,ancestry

"Yoshinori J. Fukuya, Alicia Martínez-Flor",2008.0,The Interactive Effects of Pragmatic-Eliciting Tasks and Pragmatic Instruction,": the effects of data-gathering methods on pragmatic data have been well documented, yet an inquiry into the interactive effects of assessment tasks with pragmatic instruction has received scant attention. This study investigated the interaction between two assessment tasks (e-mail and phone) and two types of pragmatic instruction (explicit and implicit). Forty-nine Spanish learners of English engaged in these two tasks as pre- and posttests. The explicit group received 12 hours of metapragmatic information on head acts and hedges in suggestions while the implicit group was the recipient of recast and input enhancement activities. The results showed that postin-structional improvement of the explicit condition was significantly more than that of the implicit condition in the phone task, although improvements of these two conditions were on par in the e-mail task. This task-induced variability might have been caused by an interaction between the feature of the two types of knowledge (i.e., monitoring capability) and an access to the knowledge bases (i.e., the role of attention to appropriateness and accuracy) in the two tasks.",,10.1111/J.1944-9720.2008.TB03308.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1944-9720.2008.TB03308.X,ancestry
"Kenneth R. Rose, Connie Ng Kwai-fun",2001.0,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: Inductive and deductive teaching of compliments and compliment responses,"Introduction This chapter reports the results of a study on the effects of inductive and deductive approaches to instruction in pragmatics, with the target features being compliments and compliment responses. The literature on these speech acts – along with that on requests and apologies – is among the richest in crosscultural and interlanguage pragmatics, offering coverage of both pragmalinguistics and sociopragmatics. Compliments and compliment responses were also among the first speech acts to be targeted for empirically informed teaching of pragmatics (Holmes & Brown, 1987), as well as for the study of the effects of instruction in interlanguage pragmatics (Billmyer, 1990a, 1990b). The current study incorporates aspects of each of these lines of inquiry, but adds several elements, namely, the two instructional approaches and the foreign language context. Background We will not provide a detailed survey of the literature on the effects of instruction in pragmatics, or on issues such as explicit and implicit learning, both of which receive comprehensive coverage in Bardovi- Harlig (this volume) and Kasper (this volume). We will, however, discuss in brief some of the relevant literature on compliments and compliment responses, the effects of instruction in compliments and compliment responses, and inductive and deductive approaches to teaching. Research on compliments is largely traced back to the work of Nessa Wolfson and Joan Manes (Wolfson & Manes, 1980; Manes & Wolfson, 1981; Wolfson, 1981a, 1981b, 1983, 1984, 1988, 1989a; Manes, 1983), which provided the first comprehensive description of the formulaicity of compliments in American English.",,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.013,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139524797.013,ancestry
J. Sykes,2013.0,Synchronous CMC and Pragmatic Development: Effects of Oral and Written Chat,"This study systematically examines the strength of the connection between synchronous CMC and pragmatic instruction by measuring the effects of three types of synchronous group discussion (written chat [WC], oral chat [OC], and traditional face-to-face [FF] discussion) on the acquisition of the speech act (refusals of an invitation) in the target language. Zhao (2003) notes that CMC research is limited in terms of investigating the effects these types of discussions have on other features of language development. Even so, the existing research indicates a positive connection between the use of written chat and oral production (e.g., Healy-Beauvois, 1997; Payne & Whitney, 2002). However, no other investigations specifically address the effects of CMC (written or oral) on pragmatic acquisition. In this study, two classes of third-semester Spanish students (N = 27) participated in small group discussions as well as pre and post role-play tasks that elicited the invitation refusal. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of these role plays illustrate that synchronous discussion type does have an effect on pragmatic development. The WC groups outperformed the others in terms of both complexity and variety of strategies used. A discussion of the results and implications for future research and pedagogy is included.",,10.1558/CJ.V22I3.399-431,https://doi.org/10.1558/CJ.V22I3.399-431,ancestry

This article reviews current trends in the use of mediated communication and offers a vision for near-future second and foreign language (L2) learning that utilizes emerging media as (a) meaningful contexts for L2 language development and (b) a means for adding real world relevance to in-class uses of internet-mediated communication tools. In this article, we first explore a sampling of Web 2.0 technologies (e.g., blogs, wikis, and social bookmarking) related to collaborative content building and dissemination of information. We then consider three types of 3-dimensional virtual environments, including open social virtualities (such as Second Life and There), massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) (e.g., World of Warcraft, Everquest, and Eve Online), and synthetic immersive environments (SIEs, i.e., visually rendered spaces which combine aspects of open social virtualities with goal-directed gaming models to address specific learning objectives). In particular, we report on SIEs as they might be used to foster interlanguage pragmatic development and briefly report on an existing project in this area. The ultimate goal is to spark future research and pedagogical innovation in these areas of emerging digital media in order to arrive at a greater understanding of the complexities involved in their integration with language learning in ways that will be most relevant to the communicative contexts of the 21st century.",,10.11139/CJ.25.3.528-546,https://doi.org/10.11139/CJ.25.3.528-546,ancestry

N. Ellis,2006.0,Language Acquisition as Rational Contingency Learning,"This paper considers how fluent language users are rational in their language processing, their unconscious language representation systems optimally prepared for comprehension and production, how language learners are intuitive statisticians, and how acquisition can be understood as contingency learning. But there are important aspects of second language acquisition that do not appear to be rational, where input fails to become intake. The paper describes the types of situation where cognition deviates from rationality and it introduces how the apparent irrationalities of L2 acquisition result from standard phenomena of associative learning as encapsulated in the models of Rescorla and Wagner (1972) and Cheng and Holyoak (1995), which describe how cue salience, outcome importance, and the history of learning from multiple probabilistic cues affect the development of ‘learned selective attention’ and transfer. This article considers how fluent language users are rational in their language processing, rational in the sense that their unconscious language representation systems are optimally prepared for comprehension and production. In this view, language learners are intuitive statisticians, weighing the likelihoods of interpretations and predicting which constructions are likely in the current context, and language acquisition is contingency learning, that is the gathering of information about the relative frequencies of form‐function mappings. These arguments are well supported by the psycholinguistic evidence relating to first language. But there are important aspects of second language acquisition that do not appear to accord with this characterization, those aspects where despite massive experience of naturalistic input and usage, the system fails to become optimally tuned to represent the second language forms, their functions, and their contextualized likelihoods of occurrence. The article builds the framework for an explanation of the seeming irrationalities of L2 acquisition in terms of standard phenomena of associative learning involving ‘learned selective attention.’ In order to place L1 and L2 in the context of a rational analysis of language learning, I first illustrate the problem by considering the design of word processors of a more mechanical kind than is the ultimate goal of our inquiry. Having thus set a concrete stage, I outline the process of the rational analysis of learning and memory (Anderson 1989, 1991b; Anderson and Milson 1989; Anderson and Schooler 2000).

We describe the pragmatics tutoring curriculum, the pragmatics learning journals that are part of the curriculum, and a Chinese pragmatics test that we developed and used for this study. Pre- and post-tests of oral Chinese pragmatic ability were given to an experimental group (N = 19) of students who took the tutorial program while studying abroad in China for a summer and to a control group (N = 19) of students who did not take the program or study abroad. The test results, learning journals, and end-of-program surveys showed that the experimental group improved their pragmatic performance and cross-cultural awareness and had a positive attitude toward the enhanced study-abroad program. The study demonstrates that a summer study-abroad program that uses native-speaker interaction to improve pragmatic ability is beneficial. We discuss how and why the explicit teaching of pragmatics can and should be fully integrated into a study-abroad curriculum.",,10.1515/iprg.2010.016,https://doi.org/10.1515/iprg.2010.016,ancestry

Alicia Martínez-Flor,2013.0,Learners' Production of Refusals: Interactive Written DCT versus Oral Role-Play,"Scholars in the field of interlanguage pragmatics (ELP) have examined second language learners' development of pragmatics by means of employing different data collection instruments (Beebe and Cummings, 1996; Duan, 2008; Houck and Gass, 1996; Martinez-Flor, 2006; Sasaki, 1998; Yuan, 2001). Findings from this research have showed the existence of task effects, since learners' performance varied depending on the task they were involved in. Specifically, given the interactive nature of role-plays and authentic discourse, learners' responses in the oral tasks were longer and more elaborate than those elicited in the written form. Therefore, ILP researchers have claimed the need to further investigate this area by widening the types of instruments being employed as well as the context in which they are used. Bearing these assumptions in mind, the present study aims at examining the effects of two production instruments (i.e., interactive written discourse completion test (DCT) and oral role-plays) on learners' use of refusals in a foreign language setting. The participants included 20 Spanish university learners who were required to make refusals to requests in written and oral production instruments. In these research methods, all situations i) varied according to the sociopragmatic factors of status and social distance; ii) were set at familiar contexts to the participants; and iii) asked learners to perform refusals in the role of students. Learners' performance when making refusals in the interactive written DCT and oral role-plays was compared. Results from such a comparison will be presented and discussed, and pedagogical implications highlighted.1 IntroductionOver the last decades, the area of interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) has shown an increasing interest in examining how learners' pragmatic competence in a second (L2) or foreign (FL) language is learnt and taught (Alcon and Martinez-Flor, 2005, 2008; Ishihara and Cohen, 2010; Kasper and Rose, 2002; Martinez-Flor et al., 2003; Rose and Kasper, 2001; Tatsuki, 2005). Since pragmatic language use is a very complex phenomenon with a lot of contextual factors influencing its actual performance, it is of paramount importance to carefully design the methods2 that elicit learners' production of a given pragmatic feature. In fact, how to collect appropriate data is a crucial issue in pragmatic research since the use of a particular elicitation instrument may potentially influence research outcomes (Alcon and Martinez-Flor, 2008; Nurani, 2009). That is the reason why continuous improvements concerning research methodologies in the pragmatics realm have been developed (Bardovi-Harlig, 1999; Cohen, 2004; Felix-Brasdefer, 2010; Kasper, 2000; Kasper and Dahl, 1991; Kasper and Roever, 2005), although there is still the need to further investigate this area by widening the types of data collection methods created, as well as including learners from distinct linguistic backgrounds (Trosborg, 2010).Within this framework, the aim of this chapter is to examine the effects on two elicitation instruments (i.e., interactive written DCT and oral role-play) on learners' production of refusals in a FL context. To this end, we will first provide a detailed literature review on data collection methods employed in ILP by differentiating between oral and written production data. Additionally, the studies that have been conducted with the aim of comparing both oral and written production data will also be described. Then, we will present our particular study with an explanation of how the two instruments were elaborated. Finally, concluding remarks of the present study will be mentioned and suggestions for further research will be proposed.2 Literature review on data production collection instruments in ILPKasper and Roever (2005) have examined the main methodological approaches that have been employed to analyze how target language pragmatics is learnt.

"A. Liddicoat, C. Crozet",2001.0,Acquiring French interactional norms through instruction,"Introduction The emergence of intercultural competence in language teaching (Kramsch, 1993, 1995; Lustig & Koester, 1993; Byram & Zarate, 1994; Crozet, Liddicoat, & Lo Bianco, 1999) has led to a need to focus on a second language as a vehicle for communication in cultural contexts, and this in turn implies that an important goal for language learning is developing an understanding of appropriate communication in the target language (Zarate, 1986; Buttjes & Byram, 1990; Kramsch, 1995; Tickoo, 1995; Fantini, 1997; Liddicoat, 1997b). Consequently, language teaching now needs to be seen more in the context of intercultural communication, with the aim of preparing learners to communicate outside their own cultural boundaries (Bolten, 1993; Crozet, 1996; Liddicoat, 1997b; Liddicoat & Crozet, 1997; Liddicoat, Crozet, Jansen, & Schmidt, 1997; Crozet & Liddicoat, 1999; Crozet et al., 1999). In such a perspective, pragmatic and discoursal practices become an integral part of language learning from early on because they play a central role in intercultural communication, and mismatches between them have been identified as a key factor in communication breakdowns. Many studies have shown that culturally based differences about what is expected during communication can be a significant cause of crosscultural communication difficulties (Gumperz, Judd, & Roberts, 1979; Wierzbicka, 1985, 1991; Kotthoff & Auer, 1987; Gudykunst & Kim, 1992). These expectations may be linked to differences in the realization of particular speech acts, or they may be linked to broader, and often more diffuse, issues of discourse organization and conversational style.",,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.012,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139524797.012,ancestry

The importance of a research basis for choosing pragmatic materials to teach is underscored, and the focus is put on sources for materials on pragmatics and the means of data collection. Issues in the teaching of pragmatics are considered, including determining which material to teach, how to prepare teachers to teach it, and the role of teachers in facilitating the learning of pragmatics. Next, L2 pragmatics is viewed from the learners' perspective, in terms of the learning and performance of pragmatics, as well as approaches to assessing what it is that learners are able to do in a pragmatically appropriate way. Finally, consideration is given to the role of technology in making pragmatics accessible to learners, with reference to a website for teachers and curriculum writers and to websites designed for learners of specific languages such as Japanese and Spanish. Recent work on virtual environments for practicing Spanish pragmatics is discussed and preliminary findings from a small-scale study of this effort are reported.",,10.1017/S0261444807004880,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0261444807004880,ancestry

K. Bardovi-Harlig,2001.0,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: Evaluating the empirical evidence: Grounds for instruction in pragmatics?,"Introduction Everyone who works with a second or foreign language, whether learners, teachers, or researchers, knows a funny story about crosscultural pragmatics – or maybe the stories are really not that funny. From the perspective of the speaker, they may be about feeling silly, helpless, or rude; from the perspective of the listener, they may be about feeling confused, insulted, or angry. Anecdotal evidence inspires us to say that we ought to teach, as one of our ESL students said, the “secret rules” of language. Much research has gone into identifying how speakers of various languages realize speech acts, take turns, and use silence, for example, so that what our student called the secret rules are not unknown; and even if our knowledge is incomplete at this stage, could it form the basis of an informed pedagogy? In other words, is there empirical evidence that warrants the development and implementation of a pedagogy of pragmatics in second and foreign language instruction? In this chapter, I will review the empirical evidence that shows that native speakers (NSs) and nonnative speakers (NNSs) of a given target language appear to have different systems of pragmatics, discuss the factors that influence the development of L2 pragmatics systems, and then address the question of whether differences in pragmatics systems warrant instructional treatment. The evidence This review adopts a speech act perspective. Although it is not the only way of viewing pragmatics, speech act research has been well represented in crosscultural and interlanguage pragmatics research, and provides a common analytic framework which facilitates comparison across studies.",,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.005,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139524797.005,ancestry

"G. Kasper, Kenneth R. Rose",1999.0,PRAGMATICS AND SLA,"Pragmatics has two roles in SLA: It acts as a constraint on linguistic forms and their acquisition, and it represents a type of communicative knowledge and object of L2 learning in its own right. The first role of pragmatics is evident in functionalist (Tomlin 1990) and interactionist (Long 1996) views of SLA. The second role puts pragmatics on a par with morphosyntax, lexis, and phonology in that inquiry focuses on learners' knowledge, use, and acquisition of L2 pragmatics. It is the latter sense of “pragmatics and SLA” that is the focus of this paper. In analogy with other areas of specialization within SLA—interlanguage syntax, interlanguage lexis, and so forth—the study of nonnative speakers' use and acquisition of L2 pragmatic knowledge is referred to as interlanguage pragmatics.",,10.1017/S0267190599190056,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190599190056,ancestry

Yet the extent to which English language teacher preparation programs incorporate explicit instruction about pragmatics into their curricula remains unknown. A nationwide survey of master's-level TESOL programs was conducted to determine where and how pragmatics is covered in the TESOL curriculum, what resources are used to teach graduate TESOL students about pragmatics, as well as to determine some of the prevalent attitudes, beliefs, and opinions about pragmatics held by TESOL graduate program directors and faculty. Individuals from 94 master's-level TESOL programs in the United States participated in the study. Participating programs represent a variety of geographic regions, institution types, and departments. The findings of the study indicate that pragmatics is covered in a wide range of courses across programs (Sociolinguistics, Discourse Analysis, Introduction to Linguistics, Teaching Methods, SLA, etc.), and that the time spent covering pragmatics varies from no time at all, to more than 8 weeks, depending on the program. A great deal of variation was also found in graduate program directors' and faculty members' beliefs about the role of pragmatics in the TESOL curriculum.",,10.1002/J.1545-7249.2009.TB00225.X,https://doi.org/10.1002/J.1545-7249.2009.TB00225.X,ancestry

Each treatment group received one of the following: (a) deductive instruction; (b) inductive instruction with problem-solving tasks; or (c) inductive instruction with structured input tasks. These tasks all involved explicit input-based instruction and were intended to test for differences in deductive versus inductive treatments. Treatment group performance was compared with that of a control group on a range of input- and output-based pretests, posttests, and follow-up tests. The results indicate that the three treatment groups performed significantly better than the control group, suggesting that in this study explicit input-based instruction was effective both deductively and inductively for learners' comprehension and production of English polite requests. There was also some indication that 
inductive treatment may be superior in the longer term.",,10.18806/TESL.V26I1.389,https://doi.org/10.18806/TESL.V26I1.389,ancestry

"Elsa Roberts, Burgess, Denise",1995.0,Teaching particular languages,"outlines the design and development of a course the aimed to meet the needs of ESL students studying in the Faculty of Arts. The development of Critical Language Awareness in relation to general and subject specific study skills is discussed. The term 'Critical Communication Skills' (CCS) is intro-duced and defined. An outline is given of a two-part course. In Part One students work through materials which address CCS in relation to subject of common interest — the media in South Africa. In Part Two the demands of studying specific subjects are presented (e.g. Philosophy). The course is discussed in relation to ESP and critical skills development for use beyond university study. each associated with different types of innovations, highlight a new set of perspectives on the role of perceived attributes of ELT innovations. This paper reports the findings of a study on the intonation of second-language speakers of English from three language groups: Spanish, Japanese and Thai. The investigation focused on how non-native speakers use intonation to signal meaning in the structure of their discourse. Thirty adult speakers of English as a second language at the intermediate level and ten native speaker controls were tape recorded in both oral reading and free speech tasks. The speech data were analysed on a Visipitch machine to measure how pitch and intensity were used contrastively to show relationships in discourse. Following a model of intonational meaning dev-eloped by Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, pitch accents, phrase accents, boundary tones, and para-tones were measured. The study revealed that while the native speakers made significant use of pitch contrasts to signal meaning on the items measured, the non-native speakers did not consistently use pitch to signal meaningful contrasts in many of the same environments. This study investigated the effect of functional-analytic teaching on aspects of French immersion (FI) students sociolinguistic competence at the Grade 8 level. A set of functional-analytic materials, entailing the study and practice of sociostylistic variation, was implemented in three FI classrooms by their respective teachers during French language arts classes over an average period of five weeks. A pre-test, an immediate post-test, and a delayed post-test were administered to the experimental group as well as to a comparison group in order to compare classes on three measures of sociolinguistic competence (defined as the ability to recognise and produce socially appropriate language in context). The study demonstrated that functional-analytic teaching substantially improved aspects of FI students' sociolinguistic competence in at least three ways: (1) by significantly increasing their ability in oral production to appropriately and accurately use vous in formal situations; (2) by significantly increasing their ability in written production to appropriately use vous in formal letters, and, in the short run, to use polite closings in formal letters; and (3) by significantly increasing their ability to recognise contextually appropriate French. speakers showed that: (1) the present perfect serves as the dominant past tense form for main verbs in the German colloquial standard; (2) modal verbs, the copula sein 'be,' haben 'have,' and certain formulaic expression occur in the preterite; and (3) the use of the past tense forms is linked to contextual and social factors. A German syllabus, then, must include a discussion of verb type when presenting the everyday use of the German preterite and present perfect. The study points to the situational and social contexts influencing the use of grammatical structures rather than merely presenting contextless rules governing their use. This study examines the role of illustrations in language learning and presents an analysis of the illustration content of 18 texts for teaching introductory Spanish published between 1960 and 1989. It also discusses the appropriate use of illustrations in teaching and considers future prospects.",,10.1017/S0261444800007953,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0261444800007953,ancestry

Over four consecutive days, an input group (n = 17) and an output group (n = 17) practiced using target request-making forms via computerized input-based and output-based practice activities, respectively. Meanwhile, a control group (n = 15) did Chinese reading comprehension exercises that did not contain the target pragmatic features. Two computerized instruments (a pragmatic listening judgment task and an oral discourse completion task) were administered to assess pragmatic development over time. The results showed that, regardless of practice modality (input-based and output-based), four instances of processing target pragmatic features were sufficient to enhance pragmatic performance accuracy, yet more than eight instances were needed for the development of performance speed.",,10.1075/lllt.36.04li,https://doi.org/10.1075/lllt.36.04li,ancestry

Additionally, it also explores whether receptive and productive bilinguals resort to pragmalinguistic, sociopragmatic and linguistic information in different ways during the planning and execution of refusals in English. Ninety-two students of English (52 receptive bilinguals and 40 productive bilinguals of Catalan and Spanish) participated in the study, which involved a one-group pre-test/post-test design and an instructional treatment. Retrospective verbal reports were used to examine the information attended to during the pre-test and post-test role-plays, that is to say, before and after receiving instruction on refusals. Research findings showed that both receptive and productive bilinguals increased their attention and pragmalinguistic awareness of refusals in English, but the latter seemed to display a higher degree of metapragmatic awareness. In addition, productive bilinguals showed higher communicative sensitivity, mainly in the form of concern for the interlocutor’s feelings, and a conversational approach that can be defined as hearer-oriented. Findings of the study add new insights on how bilingualism may influence third language pragmatic learning in instructional settings.",,10.1515/IP-2012-0028,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP-2012-0028,ancestry

Noriko Iwashita,2003.0,NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND POSITIVE EVIDENCE IN TASK-BASED INTERACTION,"This study examines the role of task-based conversation in second language (L2) grammatical development, focusing on the short-term effects of both negative feedback and positive evidence on the acquisition of two Japanese structures. The data are drawn from 55 L2 learners of Japanese at a beginning level of proficiency in an Australian tertiary institution. Five different types of interactional moves made by native speaker interlocutors during task-based interaction were identified, by way of which learners received implicit negative feedback and positive evidence about the two target structures. The relative frequency of each interactional move type was calculated, and associated changes in the learners' performance on immediate and delayed posttests were examined. It was found that, although native speaker interactional moves containing positive evidence about the two target structures were 10 times more frequent during task-based language learning than those containing implicit negative feedback, only learners who had an above-average score on the pretest benefited from the positive evidence provided. Implicit negative feedback, on the other hand, had beneficial effects on short-term development of the grammatical targets regardless of the learner's current mastery of the target structures. Moreover, recasts were found to have a larger impact than other conversational moves on short-term L2 grammatical development.",,10.1017/S0272263103000019,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263103000019,ancestry
Satomi Takahashi,2001.0,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: The role of input enhancement in developing pragmatic competence,"Introduction Input enhancement in second language acquisition (SLA) has been addressed in studies of form-focused instruction at morphosyntactic levels, known as Focus on Form (FonF) research (e.g., White, Spada, Lightbown & Ranta, 1991; Carroll, Swain & Roberge, 1992; Fotos, 1993; Spada & Lightbown, 1993; Trahey & White, 1993; see Doughty & Williams, 1998; Long & Robinson, 1998, for an overview). Following Sharwood Smith's (1991, 1993) definition of input enhancement, researchers experimentally manipulated instructional input on L2 structures in various ways: some form of corrective feedback with or without metalinguistic information (e.g., Doughty & Varela, 1998), visual enhancement (textual modification) with the use of bold or italic face (e.g., Alanen, 1995; Jourdenais, Ota, Stauffer, Boyson, & Doughty, 1995; J. White, 1998), and task manipulation directing learners to notice and attend to target structures (e.g., Hulstijn, 1989; Robinson, 1996; Williams & Evans, 1998). All of these studies provided evidence that high levels of attention-drawing activities, as represented by presenting metalinguistic information and corrective feedback, are more helpful for learners in gaining the mastery of target-language structures than simple exposure to positive evidence. These findings thus provide the basis for theoretical verification of Schmidt's (1993a, 1995, 1998) Noticing Hypothesis, which states that conscious noticing is the necessary and sufficient condition for converting input to intake. In contrast to the rich array of input enhancement research into morphosyntactic features, there have been considerably fewer studies specifically focusing on the role of input enhancement in developing L2 pragmatic competence.",,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.014,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139524797.014,ancestry

In this paper I argue that pragmatic failure is an area of cross-cultural communication breakdown which has received very little attention from language teachers. I suggest that there is one area of pragmatic failure ('pragmalinguistic failure') which is fairly easy to overcome. It is simply a question of highly conventionalized usage which can be taught quite straightforwardly as 'part of the grammar'. The second area ('sociopragmatic failure') is much more difficult to deal with, since it involves the student's system of beliefs as much as his/her knowledge of the language. I argue that it is essential to avoid prescriptivism in this very sensitive area of language in use. To do so we must draw on insights from theoretical pragmatics and develop ways of heightening and refining students' metapragmatic awareness, so that they are able to express themselves as they choose.",,10.1093/APPLIN/4.2.91,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/4.2.91,ancestry

How does it differ from other constructs such as L2 proficiency and language aptitude? Second, the article considers how L2 explicit knowledge can be measured. It critically reviews some of the ways in which explicit knowledge has been operationalized in second language acquisition research and discusses some of the instruments that have been used to measure L2 explicit knowledge.

This study, based in part on previous research by Wildner-Bassett (1984), examined (1) whether gambit use in Spanish can be taught effectively in the classroom, allowing the student to use gambits appropriately in unplanned speech; (2) how the type of interactional situation (a friendly discussion versus a complaint) affects the production of gambits; and (3) what types of gambits show the greastest increases in use for each interactional situation. Participants were intermediate students. A repeated-measures design was used. Results suggest that students can be taught to use gambits effectively and appropriately in the classroom. In addition, the nature of the interactional situation seemed to make a difference in the ability of the students to produce gambits in spontaneous interaction and in the types of gambits they produced.",,10.1111/J.1944-9720.2002.TB03153.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1944-9720.2002.TB03153.X,ancestry

In this study, 60 adult native speakers of Japanese with intermediate-level proficiency in English were each randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups, which consisted of 3 treatment groups and 1 control group. Each treatment group received one of the following kinds of instruction in English pragmatics: (a) deductive instruction, (b) inductive instruction with problem-solving tasks, or (c) inductive instruction with structured input tasks. Both the deductive and inductive approaches constituted different types of explicit input-based instruction. The purpose was to teach the learners how to use lexical/phrasal downgraders and syntactic downgraders in English to perform complex requests. All participants completed a pretest, a posttest, and a follow-up test. Each test included 2 receptive judgment tasks and 2 production tasks. The 3 treatment groups performed significantly better than the control group (p < .006). However, for the listening test, only the participants in the deductive instruction group showed a reduction in the positive effects of the treatment between the posttest and the follow-up test.",,10.1111/J.1540-4781.2008.00752.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1540-4781.2008.00752.X,ancestry

We first examine transcripts of exchanges taking place among multilingual individuals in multicultural settings. We briefly review what conversation and discourse analysis can explain about these exchanges. We then build on these analyses, using insights from complexity theory and interactional sociolinguistics. We finally outline the components of a competence in multilingual encounters that has not been sufficiently taken into consideration by applied linguists and that we call ‘symbolic competence’.",,10.1093/APPLIN/AMN022,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/AMN022,ancestry

From this same approach, a review of theoretical perspectives on pragmatic learning and how they have been operationalised in interlanguage pragmatic research is presented. Second, by paying attention to studies on learning the speech act of requesting that have been conducted in the EFL classroom, the author addresses the issue of whether cognitive and socially-oriented theories are complementary and, if so, how they can be integrated into classroom research on pragmatics. Taking into account the debate between positivism and relativism in SLA theory construction, here the author suggests relativism as a viable paradigm in research on interlanguage pragmatics. At the same time, language classrooms are presented as settings where cognitive and socially-oriented approaches can merge, and new perspectives on investigating pragmatic learning in foreign language contexts arc discussed.",,10.1515/IRAL.2008.008,https://doi.org/10.1515/IRAL.2008.008,ancestry

"V. Sardegna, Daniella Molle",2010.0,Videoconferencing with strangers: Teaching Japanese EFL students verbal backchannel signals and reactive expressions,"Abstract The aim of this study is to determine the teachability and learnability of English verbal backchannel signals and reactive expressions during a two-hour videoconference lesson on English conversation strategies. The lesson was given by ESL teachers (n = 2) in the United States to EFL students (n = 35) in Japan. Five of the students participated in the videoconference. The remaining thirty were mostly observers. The paper reports on the collaborative development and execution of the videoconference lesson, and its short-term effects on the five participants' use of verbal backchannel signals and reactive expressions. The analysis of student use of these tokens before and after instruction suggests that the pedagogical intervention had a positive short-term effect on student production of reactive tokens. The paper examines the pedagogical implications of the obtained results for the second/foreign language classroom. It also addresses the benefits and challenges of using videoconferencing in teaching pragmatics, and discusses possible avenues for future research.",,10.1515/iprg.2010.013,https://doi.org/10.1515/iprg.2010.013,ancestry

"Kerry J. Louw, Tracey M. Derwing, Marilyn L. Abbott",2010.0,Teaching Pragmatics to L2 Learners for the Workplace: The Job Interview,"This article reports on a pedagogical tool developed to facilitate effective inter-cultural communication in the workplace. We created pre- and post-instruction videos of a native speaker (NS) and non-native speakers (NNSs) in simulated job interviews. Initial interviews were examined for pragmatic difficulties, and one of the researchers also conducted pre- and post-interviews with the recruiters and the NNSs to obtain reactions to the interviews. Their initial videos and post-interview reactions were used to instruct the NNSs in the pragmatics of a job interview. A panel of three expert instructors also watched the pre- and post-instruction videos and rated all interviews on an inventory of specific pragmatic skills. Their ratings were analyzed to determine the candidates' progress and patterns of pragmatic difficulties. Candidates showed marked improvement in their second interviews, demonstrating that the pedagogical intervention used promoted the development of pragmatic competence. Implications for ESL programs, instructors, TESL, and EWP are discussed.Le présent article porte sur un outil pédagogique élaboré pour faciliter une communication interculturelle efficace au travail. Nous avons produit des vidéos avant et après instruction d'un locuteur natif et d'un locuteur non natif dans des entrevues d'emploi simulées. Nous avons évalué les premières entrevues en fonction des difficultés pragmatiques, et l'un des chercheurs a aussi effectué des entrevues avant et après avec les recruteurs et les locuteurs non natifs, afin d'obtenir des réactions aux entrevues. Leurs vidéos initiales et les réactions après les entrevues ont été utilisées pour orienter les locuteurs non natifs dans la pragmatique de l'entrevue d'emploi. Trois éducateurs spécialisés ont aussi visionné les vidéos avant et après instruction et classé toutes les entrevues selon des aptitudes pragmatiques particulières. Le classement attribué a été analysé afin de déterminer les progrès des candidats et les types de difficultés pragmatiques. Les candidats ont affiché une amélioration marquée lors de leur deuxième entrevue, ce qui a démontré que l'intervention pédagogique utilisée a favorisé le développement d'une compétence pragmatique.

Youjin Kim,2012.0,"TASK COMPLEXITY, LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES, AND KOREAN EFL LEARNERS’ QUESTION DEVELOPMENT","Building on the cognitive and interactive perspectives of task research, the cognition hypothesis states that increasing task complexity promotes greater interaction and feedback and thus facilitates second language (L2) development (Robinson, 2001b, 2007a). To date, very little research has explored this claim during learner-learner interactions in English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom contexts in which a task-based syllabus is implemented. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of task complexity on the occurrence of interaction-driven learning opportunities and question development in such a classroom context. Korean university students (N = 191) from four intact English classes were randomly assigned to one comparison group and three experimental groups with various task-complexity levels (i.e., simple, +complex, and ++complex) based on Robinson’s framework. Their interactions were audiorecorded, and occurrences of learning opportunities, operationalized as language-related episodes (LREs), were identified. Question development was identified between pretest and posttests on the basis of the learners’ stage advancement using Pienemann and Johnston’s (1987) developmental sequence. Results indicated that more complex tasks promoted a greater number of LREs and particularly led to LREs targeting developmentally advanced question structures, which result in question development.",,10.1017/S0272263112000368,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263112000368,ancestry

Because acquisition and use occur in a social context, it is important for second–language acquisition researchers to understand the ways in which social context and the acquisition and use of a second language are related. In recent years, our understanding of language as a social phenomenon has increased greatly. In a recent survey of sociolinguistics and language teaching, McKay and Hornberger (1996) divide the field into four related areas: 1) studies of language and society–how large–scale social and political issues affect language use in a particular society, 2) studies of language variation—how the “same” language varies from speaker to speaker, from place to place, and from situation to situation, 3) studies of language and interaction—how language is used in face–to–face communication, and 4) studies of language and culture—how particular cultures privilege some kinds of language over others.",,10.1017/S0267190599190068,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190599190068,ancestry

R. Lyster,2004.0,DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF PROMPTS AND RECASTS IN FORM-FOCUSED INSTRUCTION,"Four teachers and their eight classes of 179 fifth-grade (10–11-year-old) students participated in this quasi-experimental classroom study, which investigated the effects of form-focused instruction (FFI) and corrective feedback on immersion students' ability to accurately assign grammatical gender in French. The FFI treatment, designed to draw attention to selected noun endings that reliably predict grammatical gender and to provide opportunities for practice in associating these endings with gender attribution, was implemented in the context of regular subject-matter instruction by three of the four teachers, each with two classes, for approximately 9 hours during a 5-week period, while the fourth teacher taught the same subject matter without FFI to two comparison classes. Additionally, each of the three FFI teachers implemented a different feedback treatment: recasts, prompts, or no feedback. Analyses of pretest, immediate-posttest, and delayed-posttest results showed a significant increase in the ability of students exposed to FFI to correctly assign grammatical gender. Results of the written tasks in particular, and to a lesser degree the oral tasks, revealed that FFI is more effective when combined with prompts than with recasts or no feedback, as a means of enabling L2 learners to acquire rule-based representations of grammatical gender and to proceduralize their knowledge of these emerging forms.This study was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (nos. 410-98-0175 and 410-2002-0988).

Although grammatical competence may not be a sufficient condition for pragmatic development, it may be a necessary condition.

It is hypothesized that such instruction raises learners' awareness of the functions and contextual distributions of routines, enabling them to become more pragmatically fluent. Two versions of a communication course taught to advanced German learners of English for 14 weeks are examined, one version providing explicit metapragmatic information, the other withholding it. Samples of tape-recorded conversations at various stages of the courses are used to assess how students' pragmatic fluency developed and whether and how the development of fluency benefits from metapragmatic awareness.",,10.1017/S0272263100014893,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263100014893,ancestry

R. Ellis,2000.0,Task-based research and language pedagogy,"Two very different theoretical accounts of task-based language use and learning are critiqued and their relevance for language pedagogy discussed. One account, which will be referred to as the psycholinguistic perspective, draws on a computational model of second language (L2) acquisition (Lantolf, 1996). According to this perspective, tasks are viewed as devices that provide learners with the data they need for learning; the design of a task is seen as potentially determining the kind of language use and opportunities for learning that arise.Three different psycholinguistic models are discussed: Long’s Interaction Hypothesis, Skehan’s ‘cognitive approach’ and Yule’s framework of communicative efficiency. The second theoretical account of tasks is that provided by socio-cultural theory. This is premised on the claim that participants co-construct the ‘activity’ they engage in when performing a task, in accordance with their own socio-history and locally determined goals, and that, therefore, it is difficult to make reliable predictions regarding the kinds of language use and opportunities for learning that will arise. Socio-cultural theory emphasizes the dialogic processes (such as ‘scaffolding’) that arise in a task performance and how these shape language use and learning. Both theoretical approaches afford insights that are of value to task-based language pedagogy. The psycholinguistic approach provides information that is of importance for planning task-based teaching and learning. The socio-cultural approach illuminates the kinds of improvisation that teachers and learners need to engage in during task-based activity to promote communicative efficiency and L2 acquisition.",,10.1177/136216880000400302,https://doi.org/10.1177/136216880000400302,ancestry

As the rules governing back-channeling vary from language to language, second-language learners may need help acquiring this skill. This paper is an initial exploration of how to provide this. It presents a training sequence which enables learners to acquire a basic Arabic back-channel skill, namely, that of producing feedback immediately after the speaker produces a syllable or two with a sharply falling pitch. This training sequence includes an explanation, audio examples, the use of visual signals to highlight occurrences of this pitch downslope, auditory and visual feedback on learners' attempts to produce the cue themselves, and feedback on the learners' performance as they play the role of an attentive listener in response to one side of a pre-recorded dialog. Experiments show that this enables learners to better approximate proper Arabic back-channeling behavior.",,10.1080/09588220701745825,https://doi.org/10.1080/09588220701745825,ancestry

Specifically, it examines the acquisition of various strategies (e.g., head acts, use of softeners, formality marking, and hearer-oriented directives) to realize Spanish directives. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data detected patterns in the learners' directive production. The analysis considered factors such as instruction, L2 grammatical competence, and the influence of the first language (L1) to illustrate the patterns of development of L2 pragmatics at lower proficiency levels. The results show (a) verb forms with increased morphological complexity replaced lower level directive strategies, possibly as a result of the expansion of L2 grammatical competence; (b) pragmatic competence seems to precede grammatical competence; and (c) the L1 pragmatic system appears to play a role in interpreting and processing new L2 data for use in production.",,10.1111/J.1540-4781.2006.00427.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1540-4781.2006.00427.X,ancestry

The task was given to each group twice, before and after the students received approximately 120–130 hr of classroom instruction. Comprehension was analyzed for accuracy (scores) and speed (average time taken to answer each item correctly). Results showed that, in both learner groups, accuracy and comprehension speed improved significantly over time. For the EFL group, the magnitude of effect was much less for speed than for accuracy.

Satomi Takahashi,2010.0,The effect of pragmatic instruction on speech act performance,"This chapter reviews previous research on pragmatic intervention by exploring the extent to which the teachability of second-language speech acts is constrained by the nature of intervention and learner-attributable factors. The superiority of explicit pragmatic intervention over implicit treatment is confirmed overall, particularly in the teaching of the sociopragmatic features of speech acts. However, evidence suggests that such positive effects of explicit intervention are not always assured; moreover, some forms of implicit intervention are equally effective. Such variations in the findings are best explained in terms of an explicit/implicit continuum rather than a dichotomous explicit versus implicit framework. The current review also suggests that higher levels of linguistic proficiency and learner motivation may be prerequisites for maximally enhancing pragmatic teachability.",,10.1075/lllt.26.08tak,https://doi.org/10.1075/lllt.26.08tak,ancestry

J.

Although some researchers have suggested that such findings imply a beneficial role for negative evidence (i.e., information regarding the impossibility of certain utterances in the language being learned), the source of these benefits has not been explored directly, as multiple variables are conflated in recasts. Specifically, recasts not only offer implicit negative evidence, but they also provide positive evidence. Moreover, recasts are believed to make this positive evidence especially salient. In the present study, 74 learners of L2 Spanish engaged in communicative interaction with the researcher in one of the following conditions: (a) recasts (i.e., negative evidence and enhanced salience of positive evidence), (b) negative evidence, (c) enhanced salience of positive evidence, and (d) unenhanced positive evidence (control). Only the recast and enhanced-salience groups performed significantly better than the control group on posttreatment measures, which suggests that the utility of recasts is derived at least in part from enhanced salience of positive evidence and that the implicit negative evidence they seem to provide may not be a crucial factor.",,10.1017/S0272263103000020,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263103000020,ancestry

Nguyen,2013.0,Instructional effects on the acquisition of modifiers in constructive criticism by EFL learners,"Previous research has shown that learners of English might experience considerable difficulty when giving constructive criticism to peers in instructional settings. Unlike native speakers, they tend to soften their criticism far less frequently while aggravating it far more often, and thus require pedagogical help in this area. The present study examines whether meta-pragmatic instruction facilitates the learning of linguistic resources for softening constructive criticism in an instructed language-learning context. Fifty Vietnamese high-intermediate-level students of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) were recruited for the control and treatment conditions. Over a period of 10 weeks, the treatment group received explicit instruction in eight types of criticism modifiers while the control group did not receive any equivalent instruction. For data collection, the two groups participated in discourse completion tasks, role plays, and oral peer feedback tasks before and after the treatment. The treatment group was also engaged in writing reflective journals, which were later collected and analysed for instances of input noticing. A delayed posttest was conducted for the treatment group five weeks after the experiment in order to investigate whether instructional effects (if any) lasted beyond immediate post-experimental observations. Findings show positive instructional effects on learners’ pragmatic performance and are discussed with implications for future research.",,10.1080/09658416.2012.658810,https://doi.org/10.1080/09658416.2012.658810,ancestry
Zohreh R. Eslami,2005.0,Invitations in Persian and English: Ostensible or genuine?,"Abstract The present study describes the defining features of Persian genuine and ostensible invitations based on a collection of spontaneous Persian invitations and the results of interview data. The results are compared with the structure of invitations in English reported by Isaacs and Clark (1990). The framework for data collection and data analysis designed by Isaacs and Clark and their results were used in this study. Our results show that the structure of ostensible invitations in Persian is more complex than in English. The features suggested for ostensible invitations in English are present, but these are not sufficient to distinguish ostensible invitations from genuine invitations in Persian. Invitations that meet the criteria for being genuine invitations in English can be classified as ostensible by Persian speakers. In contrast to the claim made by Isaacs and Clark regarding English speakers that ‘‘ostensible invitations are rare in most situations’’ (p. 494), our observations show that Persian speakers use a considerable number of ostensible invitations in their daily activities as a manifestation of ritual politeness (ta’arof ). The study concludes that enhancing face (Brown & Levinson 1987) for both interlocutors is the main underlying factor in using ostensible invitations in Persian. In Persian, the speaker, in adhering to societal norms, enhances his / her face as well as that of his / her interlocutor by using ostensible invitations in everyday language.",,10.1515/iprg.2005.2.4.453,https://doi.org/10.1515/iprg.2005.2.4.453,ancestry

The performance of a treatment group was compared to the performance of a control group on pre-, post-, and follow-up tests consisting of a discourse completion test and an acceptability judgment test. The results indicated that the two treatment groups outperformed the control group, with the identical task repetition group exhibiting more statistically significant improvement in the discourse completion test (a planned written-production test) and the acceptability judgment test (a planned written-judgment test). The results implied that identical task repetition stimulates deeper perceptual and mental processing than task-type repetition in learners' recognition and production of second language (L2) request downgraders.",,10.1515/IP-2012-0004,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP-2012-0004,ancestry

Sixty-one subjects were taught four morphosyntactic rules and 32 vocabulary items in an artificial language. After they had reached criterion on a set of metalinguistic tests of grammar and vocabulary, they engaged in systematic, computer-controlled comprehension and production practice for 8 weeks. Comprehension practice consisted of choosing between pictures displayed on the computer screen to match a sentence; production practice consisted of typing the correct sentence corresponding to a picture. All subjects were taught the same rules and then practiced them, and all subjects had the same amount of comprehension and production practice, but which rules were practiced in comprehension and which in production varied between groups. Results show that the learning of morphosyntactic rules is highly skill-specific and that these skills develop very gradually over time, following the same power function learning curve as the acquisition of other cognitive skills. These results are consistent with current skill acquisition theory.",,10.1017/S0272263197002040,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263197002040,ancestry

In a multidimensional analysis of 3 English structures with different acquisition profiles—the simple past, possessive determiners his/her, and the progressive aspect—we examined the phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexicosemantic characteristics of the forms as they occurred in a 110,000-word corpus of instructional talk to L2 learners. We analyzed the type/token distributions of the forms, their lexical properties, and their perceptual salience. Our findings revealed key input factors that distinguished between the early-acquired progressive, on the one hand, and the later-acquired past and his/her determiners, on the other hand. These results lend support to theoretical accounts of the input–acquisition relationship and also generate hypotheses for manipulating instructional input to increase the salience of opaque constructions.

The linguistic focus of the interventions was epistemic stance, which has rarely been studied in research on instructed SLA within the field of interlanguage pragmatics. Eighty-one learners of English at a Japanese university were divided into explicit (n = 37) and implicit (n = 44) groups for 3 hours of instruction. Written production data were collected before the interventions, immediately after them, and five months later. Learners' use of epistemic stance forms was analysed by using: (i) a measure of individual use of epistemic stance forms; and (ii) learner corpus analysis. The explicit intervention was found to be considerably more effective than the implicit intervention in both the short- and long-term for most of the targeted forms. However, in cases when learners lacked a form for a specific function before the intervention, both types of instruction appeared to be equally effective. While this research generally provides strong support for explicit instruction, the potential of implicit interventions for certain forms needs further investigation.",,10.1093/APPLIN/AMS076,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/AMS076,ancestry
Yo-an Lee,2006.0,Towards respecification of communicative competence : Condition of L2 instruction or its objective?,"The concept of communicative competence is one of the most influential theoretical developments in language education as it helped redefine the objectives of L2 instruction and the target language proficiency. While acknowledging these contributions, this paper asks if the conceptual formulation of communicative competence has other relevancies for our understanding of the realities of language use in L2 instructional settings. Classroom interaction itself is an occasion of language use that relies on the competence of the parties to the interaction; the competence that is already in the room is then a constitutive feature of the work-practices of teaching and learning. Informed by Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis, this paper proposes that communicative competence may be as much the condition of L2 instruction, one that makes L2 instruction possible in the first place, as its target outcome. Brief analyses of transcripts from ESL classrooms are offered to demonstrate how the communicative competence found in L2 classrooms is a contingent resource for language teaching and learning.",,10.1093/APPLIN/AML011,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/AML011,ancestry

"Hossein Vahid Dastjerdi, Majid Farshid",2011.0,The Role of Input Enhancement in Teaching Compliments,"To date, research regarding the effectiveness of instruction on the development of interlanguage pragmatics has favored an explicit instruction of the speech acts. A question which has received scant attention is what kind of explicit instruction is more beneficial in a foreign language setting. The fact that speech acts reflect, for the most part, routinized language behavior helps learners because much of what is used in performing speech acts could be learned as prefabricated units. This study is an attempt to practically test this routinized nature of speech acts focusing on compliment giving. To this purpose, two groups were chosen as control and experimental groups and both were instructed by different procedures of input enhancement; the former was taught through Form Comparison procedure and the latter through explicit instruction using Wolfson and Manes (1980) formula of compliment giving. The result clearly indicated that the experimental group outperformed the control group in giving compliments, indicating once again that the routinized nature of speech acts could be utilized in helping learners develop their interlanguage pragmatics.",,10.4304/JLTR.2.2.460-466,https://doi.org/10.4304/JLTR.2.2.460-466,ancestry
Rachel L. Shively,2010.0,From the virtual world to the real world: a model of pragmatics instruction for study abroad,"Abstract: With its focus on the use of language forms in cultural context, the study of pragmatics can be a valuable component in a program that prepares students to learn both language and culture in study abroad. The goal of the present study is to propose a model for pragmatic instruction in study abroad that fosters both intercultural competence and language skills, is informed by research and practice, and takes advantage of the affordances that an immersion environment and new technologies offer. The article provides an overview of the pertinent research, discusses the pedagogical implications of an ethnographic research project on the acquisition of Spanish pragmatics in study abroad, and presents a model for pragmatic instruction in the study abroad context. Key words: intercultural competence, pedagogical intervention, pragmatic development, second language acquisition, study abroad As a second rather than a foreign language environment, the study abroad (SA) context is considered by some to constitute, a priori, a ''rich'' environment for language and culture learning. However, research in the past two decades indicates that SA students do not always experience the intense exposure to the target language (TL) and culture and the accompanying gains in language proficiency and intercultural competence that were once assumed (DeKeyser, 1991; Freed, 1999; Laubscher, 1994; Miller & Ginsberg, 1995; Pelligrino, 1998; Wilkinson, 1998). In some cases, for example, SA students do not improve their TL skills more than peers who stay at home and study the TL (cf. Freed, 1995; Rodri'guez, 2001). The reasons why a sojourn abroad does not always result in the expected language- and culture-learning outcomes are numerous and complex (cf. Kinginger& Belz, 2005; Magnan & Back, 2007; Pelligrino, 1998; Polanyi, 1995). For example, opportunities for social interaction with members of the host culture may be restricted by difficulty in making contacts (Barron, 2003; Ife, 2000), by experiences of racial and gender discrimination (Polanyi, 1995; Talburt & Stewart, 1999), and by living arrangements (Churchill, 2003; Knight & Schmidt-Rinehart, 2002). However, one way to foster positive language- and culture-learning outcomes in SA is to provide students with training and instruction in language and culture (La Brack, 1993; Paige, Cohen, & Shively, 2004). Of particular interest to the present study is how instruction can assist SA students in the development of their TL pragmatic competence. Pragmatic competence refers to the knowledge and skills needed to use and interpret the meanings, assumptions, and actions expressed by language in its sociocultural context. Research on second language (L2) pragmatic development suggests that pragmatic abilities are acquired rather slowly during naturalistic acquisition (Olshtain & Blum-Kulka, 1985). Not surprisingly then, in the context of a 4- to 9- month SA experience, uninstructed L2 learners typically make only minor gains in target-like pragmatic competence (cf. Barron, 2003; Cohen & Shively, 2007; DuFon, 1999; Hoffman-Hicks, 1999). At the same time, L2 learners in instructed settings have generally been found to benefit from instruction that targets pragmatic features of the TL (Bardovi-Harlig, 2001; Rose & Kasper, 2001), suggesting that instruction can accelerate learning. In addition to the use of face-to-face classroom activities to teach L2 pragmatics, recent studies have indicated how new technologies such as interactive Web sites, synchronous chat, and virtual environments can be effectively used to facilitate pragmatic development (Belz, 2005; Gonza 'lez-Lloret, 2008; Ishihara, 2007; Sykes, 2008). While some authors have bemoaned growing access to technology in SA because it can allow students to disengage from the host culture (cf. Citron, 2003; Ogden, 2006), I argue here that rather than discouraging technology use, SA programs would do better to harness SA students' interest in new technologies as a means to reengage them with language and culture at all stages of SA (cf. …",,10.1111/J.1944-9720.2010.01063.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1944-9720.2010.01063.X,ancestry
Esther Usó-Juan,2013.0,Effects of Metapragmatic Instruction on EFL Learners' Production of Refusals,"Research into the teaching/leaming of pragmatic competence in both second and foreign language contexts has shown, in general, that simple exposure to input is insufficient for learners to develop pragmatic competence (Rose, 2005) and therefore, instruction in pragmatics is necessary to facilitate the learning of this competence in order to use language appropriately. In an attempt to expand this line of research, the present study examines the effects of explicit instruction through metapragmatic information on learners' production of an under-researched speech act, that of refusals. Pedagogical intervention is organized progressively in six steps: Researching, Reflecting, Receiving, Reasoning, Rehearsing and Revising (MartinezFlor and Uso-Juan, 2006). These steps are designed to help learners understand the form-function relationship of refusals in different social contexts. Participants' performance in pre- and post-test was compared. Results showed the benefits that this pedagogical proposal can have on learners' pragmatic production of refusals.1 IntroductionOver the last few decades, specifically after the original formulation of the notion of communicative competence (Hymes, 1972), the seminal description of its components for pedagogical purposes (Canale, 1983; Canale and Swain, 1980) and the emphasis placed on the component of pragmatic competence (Bachman, 1990), one of the main goals of language teaching professionals is the development of learners' communicative competence in a second (L2) or foreign (FL) language. As recent models of communicative competence have shown (Celce-Murcia, 2007; Uso-Juan and Martinez-Flor, 2006), communicating appropriately and effectively in the target language requires not only mastery over the features of the language system but also over the pragmatic rules of language use. It is necessary to learn how to use and understand language that is appropriate to the contextual and cultural parameters of the specific situation, because failure to do so may characterize non-native speakers as being insensitive, rude or even offensive. Given this necessity, instruction in pragmatics has been a major concern in communicative language teaching (Martinez-Flor and Uso-Juan, 2010), but still language teachers hesitate to incorporate pragmatics in their classrooms. This hesitation, as summarized by Liu (2010), could be attributed to: i) inadequacy of the description models offered by theoretical pragmaticists (Thomas, 1983); ii) difficulty of teaching pragmatics since it involves a high degree of 'face threat' (Matsuda, 1999); iii) lack of available pedagogical resources for teaching pragmatics (Matsuda, 1999) and iv) lack of valid methods for testing pragmatics (Liu, 2006). Consequently, more interventional studies on pragmatic development that utilize research-based teaching materials and different testing methods should be conducted to inform language educators.Guided by this theoretical framework, the present study attempts to determine the effectiveness of pragmatic instruction on a group of Spanish learners studying English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in relation to the speech act of refusals to requests. The rationale behind the selection of this speech act derives from the fact that, given its face-threatening nature, learners need to possess considerable pragmatic expertise to be able to perform it successfully. To this end, this chapter first presents an overview of the most pertinent research on teaching English refusals to L2/FL learners. Following this, it describes the study with a detailed explanation of the participants, the instructional treatment, the instrument and procedures for data collection and data analysis. Finally, the findings obtained by means of analyzing learners' responses in the pre- and post-test are presented and discussed.2 Literature review on teaching English refusalsA refusal is a speech act that functions as a response to an initiating act such as a request, an invitation, an offer or a suggestion. …",,10.1163/9789401209717_006,https://doi.org/10.1163/9789401209717_006,ancestry

Comparisons of average effect sizes from 49 unique sample studies reporting sufficient data indicated that focused L2 instruction results in large target-oriented gains, that explicit types of instruction are more effective than implicit types, and that Focus on Form and Focus on Forms interventions result in equivalent and large effects. Further findings suggest that the effectiveness of L2 instruction is durable and that the type of outcome measures used in individual studies likely affects the magnitude of observed instructional effectiveness. Generalizability of findings is limited because the L2 type-of-instruction domain has yet to engage in rigorous empirical operationalization and replication of its central research constructs. Changes in research practices are recommended to enhance the future accumulation of knowledge about the effectiveness of L2 instruction.",,10.1111/0023-8333.00136,https://doi.org/10.1111/0023-8333.00136,ancestry

"Michael H. Long, G. Crookes",1992.0,Three Approaches to Task‐Based Syllabus Design,"Choice of the unit of analysis in syllabus design is crucial for all aspects of a language teaching program. A variety of units, including word, structure, notion, function, topic, and situation, continue to be employed in synthetic, Type A, syllabuses. While each is relevant for analyses of the target language and its use, nativelike linguistic elements find little support as meaningful acquisition units from a language learner's perspective. Task has more recently appeared as the unit of analysis in three analytic, (primarily) Type B, alternatives: procedural, process, and task syllabuses. Each of these has certain limitations, too, but when the task syllabus is combined with a focus on form in task-based language teaching, the task receives more support in second language acquisition (SLA) research as a viable unit around which to organize language teaching and learning opportunities.",,10.2307/3587368,https://doi.org/10.2307/3587368,ancestry

Treatment group performance was compared to that of a control group on the pre-tests, post-tests, and follow-up tests: a discourse completion test, a role-play test, a listening judgement test, and an acceptability judgement test.

Jenefer Philp,2003.0,CONSTRAINTS ON “NOTICING THE GAP”,"Interaction has been argued to promote noticing of L2 form in a context crucial to learning—when there is a mismatch between the input and the learner's interlanguage (IL) grammar (Gass & Varonis, 1994; Long, 1996; Pica, 1994). This paper investigates the extent to which learners may notice native speakers' reformulations of their IL grammar in the context of dyadic interaction. Thirty-three adult ESL learners worked on oral communication tasks in NS-NNS pairs. During each of the five sessions of dyadic task-based interaction, learners received recasts of their nontargetlike question forms. Accurate immediate recall of recasts was taken as evidence of noticing of recasts by learners. Results indicate that learners noticed over 60–70% of recasts. However, accurate recall was constrained by the level of the learner and by the length and number of changes in the recast. The effect of these variables on noticing is discussed in terms of processing biases. It is suggested that attentional resources and processing biases of the learner may modulate the extent to which learners “notice the gap” between their nontargetlike utterances and recasts.",,10.1017/S0272263103000044,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263103000044,ancestry

DISCOURSE APPROACHES TO ORAL LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT,"This chapter begins with a careful look at a sample conversation and examines the many layers of interpretation that different academic traditions have constructed in order to interpret it. These layers of interpretation include linguistic forms, nonverbal communication, linguistic context, situational context, and the embodied histories that participants bring to interaction. All are incorporated into a rich definition of discourse. The chapter then reviews recent studies that have compared the discourse of oral interaction in assessment with oral discourse in contexts outside assessment to show how different they are. The next section discusses studies that have related ways of speaking to the cultural values of communities of speakers with a view to understanding the cultural miscommunication that occurs in assessment of speaking in a second language community. The review concludes by stressing the wholeness of face-to-face interaction, listing the layers of interpretation of interaction that have not thus far been considered in oral testing, and setting out a potentially fertile area for future research.",,10.1017/S0267190502000132,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190502000132,ancestry

R. Leow,2007.0,Practice in a Second Language: Input in the L2 classroom: An attentional perspective on receptive practice,"Introduction The role of input is undoubtedly crucial in the process of second/foreign language (L2) learning. Input may be defined as the L2 data (form-based and/or meaning-based) that learners receive either in the formal classroom or in a naturalistic setting. Indeed, how L2 input is presented to L2 learners in the classroom and its effects on the processes learners employ to interact with the input (input processing) have been the focus of several strands of second language acquisition (SLA) studies conducted within a psycholinguistic framework. The theoretical underpinnings of most of these psycholinguistic studies appear to include some role for attention (and possibly awareness) in the processing of L2 grammatical or linguistic data in adult learners' L2 development (e.g., Robinson, 1995; Schmidt, 1990, 1993, 1995, 2001; Tomlin & Villa, 1994; VanPatten, 2004). The term practice has several connotations (see DeKeyser, this volume for an elaborated discussion of this term in several fields of inquiry) in both the applied linguistics and cognitive psychology literatures. In applied linguistics, the notion of pedagogical practice in the typical classroom assumes some form of performance by learners in response to L2 grammatical input they receive in this setting, which may be provided prior to or during practice. In addition, the L2 input is usually manipulated in some form by the teacher. For example, learners may be exposed to L2 that has been carefully selected and manipulated by the teacher to highlight some linguistic data and may be requested to interact with it in several ways, such as selecting options related to the linguistic data in the input, performing a task, and so forth.",,10.1017/CBO9780511667275.004,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511667275.004,ancestry

By establishing a different set of inclusion/exclusion criteria than previous meta-analyses and performing a series of methodological moves, it is intended to be an update and complement to previous meta-analyses. Altogether 33 primary studies were retrieved, including 22 published studies and 11 Ph.D. dissertations. These studies were coded for 17 substantive and methodological features, 14 of which were identified as independent and moderator variables. It was found that (a) there was a medium overall effect for corrective feedback and the effect was maintained over time, (b) the effect of implicit feedback was better maintained than that of explicit feedback, (c) published studies did not show larger effects than dissertations, (d) lab-based studies showed a larger effect than classroom-based studies, (e) shorter treatments generated a larger effect size than longer treatments, and (f) studies conducted in foreign language contexts produced larger effect sizes than those in second language contexts. Possible explanations for the results were sought through data cross-tabulation and with reference to the theoretical constructs of SLA.",,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2010.00561.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-9922.2010.00561.X,ancestry
"Leila Ranta, R. Lyster",2007.0,Practice in a Second Language: A cognitive approach to improving immersion students' oral language abilities: The Awareness-Practice-Feedback sequence,"Consider the experiences of a grade-12 student who has studied French for a total of 13 years in Alberta, the first few years of which were in a total immersion program where all instruction was in French. She travels to Montreal for the first time. To her great shock, she finds that she is unable to use her French very much because the bilingual speakers she comes into contact with switch to English the minute they hear her speak. She comments, “I quickly realized … that my French is not the same as Quebecois French” (Haynes, 2001). This experience of communicative failure in the second language (L2) puts a human face on the research findings that characterize the oral production of French immersion students as being “non-nativelike.” Immersion researchers have studied the effectiveness of different types of pedagogical interventions designed to overcome the limitations of immersion instruction. These interventions have included enriching the input learners are exposed to (Harley, 1989b), drawing learners' attention to non-salient features of the L2 (Lyster, 1994), increasing the amount of student output (Kowal & Swain, 1997), and providing unambiguous feedback on learners' non-targetlike utterances (Lyster, 2004). This chapter examines the issue of the non-nativelike quality of immersion students' L2 production from the perspective of the language practice that occurs in early immersion classrooms. In this discussion, we highlight the value of using cognitive skill-learning theory (Anderson, 1983) as a framework for sequencing instructional activities aimed at improving the formal accuracy of the otherwise fluent speech of immersion students.",,10.1017/CBO9780511667275.009,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511667275.009,ancestry

"A. Cohen, Rachel L. Shively",2007.0,Acquisition of Requests and Apologies in Spanish and French: Impact of Study Abroad and Strategy-Building Intervention,"The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of a curricular intervention on study-abroad students’ use of language- and culture-learning strategies and on their acquisition of requests and apologies. The intervention consisted of a brief face-to-face orientation to learning speech acts, a self-study guidebook on language and culture strategies, which included strategies for learning speech acts, and electronic journaling by the students. The study used an experimental design in which the participants, all university students (N = 86) who spent 1 semester abroad in a Spanish- or a French-speaking country, were randomly assigned to an experimental (E) group (N= 42) or to a control (C) group (N= 44). The findings indicated that the students as a whole improved their request and apology performance over the course of 1 semester, as rated by the Spanish and French native speakers. In addition, whereas there were no statistically significant differences between the E and C groups in their rated speech act performance overall, a qualitative analysis of speech act development among learners of Spanish (N= 67) helped to identify areas in which their performance on requests and apologies either resembled that of native speakers or diverged from it. Although fewer students than native speakers used the “query preparatory with verbal downgrading,” there appeared to be some increase in the use of this strategy by study-abroad students from pre- to posttest, especially among the E group students, perhaps suggesting that for some of these students awareness about mitigating requests was enhanced by the treatment. In making apologies, not as many study-abroad students intensified their apologies in instances where native speakers tended to do so. Likewise, the percentage of study-abroad students who acknowledged responsibility for certain infractions tended to be lower than that of the native speakers, suggesting that these nonnative speakers were unaware of sociopragmatic norms for what might be expected in such situations.",,10.1111/J.1540-4781.2007.00540.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1540-4781.2007.00540.X,ancestry

"N. Ellis, Laura Collins",2009.0,"Input and Second Language Acquisition: The Roles of Frequency, Form, and Function Introduction to the Special Issue","The articles in this special issue explore how the acquisition of linguistic constructions as form–function mappings is affected by the distribution and saliency of forms in oral input, by their functional interpretations, and by the reliabilities of their form–function mappings. They consider the psycholinguistics of language learning following general cognitive principles of category learning, with schematic constructions emerging from usage. They analyze how learning is driven by the frequency and frequency distribution of exemplars within construction, the salience of their form, the significance of their functional interpretation, the match of their meaning to the construction prototype, and the reliability of their mappings. These investigations address a range of morphological and syntactic constructions in instructed, uninstructed, and laboratory settings. They include both experimental and corpus-based approaches (some conducted longitudinally) and consider the relationship between input and acquisition in the short term and over time, with a particular emphasis on spoken input directed to second and foreign language learners.

"N.

This report describes a research project that tracks the development of skilled migrants' sociopragmatic performance over 12 weeks from the classroom to the workplace. The research reported here focuses on requests in workplace interaction. Learners often have difficulty negotiating culturally appro priate content in particular speech acts, such as requests in specific contexts, even when they are able to identify the semantic features and formula required. In other words, it is often culturally appropriate content and form that learners struggle to identify (Bardovi-Harlig Sc Griffin, 2005; Bardovi-Harlig & Hartford, 1993). This study tracked the development of learners' sociopragmatic proficiency as they developed awareness of cultural differences in the appropriate expression of requests in New Zealand workplaces.",,10.5054/TQ.2010.215252,https://doi.org/10.5054/TQ.2010.215252,ancestry

Three treatments were implemented: (1) the incidental group was exposed to input and involved in meaningful output activities; (2) the implicit group was aided by visual enhancement of the input; and (3) the explicit group was aided with metapragmatic information. Discourse completion test results show that, when learners are provided with pertinent input and chances for output, visual enhancement can boost their pragmatic development, while metapragmatic information might hinder such development. Only the input-output activities (i.e., the incidental treatment) could produce durable effects in every aspect of the target features. The explicit treatment did produce durable effects in the acquisition of overall supportive moves. The effects of the visual enhancement were not durable. These results are discussed in terms of an interaction between the learner profile (young beginning learners), treatment characteristics, and the nature of target features.",,10.1002/TESQ.2,https://doi.org/10.1002/TESQ.2,ancestry

R. Dekeyser,2001.0,Cognition and Second Language Instruction: Automaticity and automatization,"Introduction: concepts and issues In a very general sense, everybody knows what automaticity means. Some doors slide open automatically, some cars shift gears automatically, some VCRs rewind automatically; in other words these objects perform their functions without requiring any physical or mental effort on our part (the meaning of the Greek adjective automatos is selfacting). In the psychological sense, every layman has had experience with automaticity too. When typing, driving a stick-shift car or using a word-processor too edit a text, we perform a complex series of tasks very quickly and efficiently, without having to think about the various components and subcomponents of action involved; sometimes we are even unable to think of them explicitly, and therefore we may have trouble visualizing the keyboard or explaining to somebody else how to use a piece of software, even though – or rather just because – we use the keyboard or the software with great ease. Initially, though, we may have found typing, driving a stick-shift car or using a spreadsheet to be slow, tricky, and tiring. The automaticity, that is the speed and ease with which we ultimately carry out these tasks, is the result of a slow process that we call automatization. Once this process has run its course, the chain of actions involved in the automatized tasks can even become hard to suppress, as we experience when forced to shift from a querty to an azerty keyboard, from a stick-shift to an automatic car, or from one kind of accounting software to another.",,10.1017/CBO9781139524780.007,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139524780.007,ancestry

Andrew Sangpil Byon,2006.0,Developing KFL Students’ Pragmatic Awareness of Korean Speech Acts: The Use of Discourse Completion Tasks,"Teaching pragmatic competence in Korean-as-a-foreign language (KFL) settings is still an underdeveloped area, when compared to teaching other language areas, such as speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The first step to enhance pragmatic language teaching in foreign language (FL) education is to raise the FL instructors’ and students’ pragmatic awareness (Kasper & Rose, 2001). This paper investigates a case of raising pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic awareness of Korean speech acts to intermediate KFL students in an American university, using a discourse completion task (DCT). This study discusses how the DCT approach, as a pragmatic-consciousness-raising (PCR) technique, can assist FL instructors in developing pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic awareness of the target speech acts. The study shows that DCT provided a very practical tool for our students to recognise the pragmatic features. Conducting a survey with L1 and L2 speakers made the learning process more engaging, relevant, and interesting for most students. Although the discussion and procedures presented in this paper are from an American college-level intermediate KFL course, the cases presented may be adapted for use in any foreign language course that has struggled with teaching L2 pragmatic competence.",,10.2167/la410.0,https://doi.org/10.2167/la410.0,ancestry

"Maria-Pilar Safont-Jordà, Laura Portolés-Falomir",2013.0,Research Method Effects on Third Language Learners' Refusals,"Research in interlanguage pragmatics has largely ignored the multilingual background of language learners (Kasper, 2007, Safont-Jorda, in press). Although some studies have been conducted (Safont-Jorda, 2003, 2005a, b; Safont-Jorda and Alcon, in press), they have focused on the learners' requestive behavior. No studies on L3 learners' refusals have been published to date. Additionally, research methods employed in the analysis of L2 and L3 learners' pragmatic competence elicit the target pragmatic item in an artificial way, whether it be, written (i.e., Discourse Completion Test) or oral (i.e., role-play), as they provide learners with a written/oral prompt for an imaginary situation. In fact, learners provide potential answers (provided that fact tool place). Researchers have widely criticized this approach as it does not account for real communication. There are a number of situational factors influencing pragmatic and communicative development as shown by recent research (Dewaele, 2007) which are not considered if data collection is restricted to controlled pragmatic production. On that account, this paper compares refusal strategies employed in a DCT and in an instructional setting, that of the language classroom, by second and third language learners. Participants were 12 adult English learners engaged in an intermediate English course. They were Catalan-Spanish bilingual (6 subjects) and Spanish monolingual (6 subjects). As expected, results show a difference in the type of refusal strategies employed in real (i.e., classroom) and royal (i.e., oral role-play) interaction and they also point to the advantage of L3 over L2 learners in the variety of refusal strategies employed.1 IntroductionThe main aim of the present paper is to examine the effect of two variables on the pragmatic production of learners of English as a Foreign Language. On the one hand, we have taken into account the effect of the research method adopted on the use of refusal strategies. On the other, we have considered the learners' linguistic background, that is, whether they were monolingual or bilingual and thus were learning English as a second (i.e., L2) or as a third language (i.e., L3). Bearing our purpose in mind, we shall first consider those studies which have contrasted results obtained by means of an oral production task and those using ethnographic or pseudo natural data. Secondly, research on the role of bilingualism in language learners' pragmatic production will be taken into account and a particular focus will be given to the use of L3 refusals. Finally, results from our study on the effect of the research method and bilingualism in English learners' production of refusals will be described.1.1 Research methods in IL exhortative actsAccording to Clark and Bangerter (2004), three main methods have been employed in pragmatics research, namely those of intuition, observation and experiment.(...) With intuitions, you imagine examples of language used in this or that situation and ask yourself whether they are grammatical or ungrammatical, natural or unnatural, appropriate or inappropriate. This was Searle's method. With experiments, you invite people into the laboratory, induce them to produce, comprehend or judge samples of language, and measure their reactions. With observations, you note what people say or write as they go about their daily business. We will name these methods by their characteristic locations: armchair, laboratory andfield (Clark and Bangerter, 2004: 25).Interlanguage pragmatics research has adopted methods employed in LI pragmatics, and has particularly made use of 'laboratory' experiment methods. As stated by Jucker (2009), these elicitation techniques (i.e., laboratory) rely on the informants' cooperation. Participants have to imagine situations and report the way they would behave or the way they would expect others to behave in them. Some authors seek to determine the most effective method for measuring pragmatic ability (Brown and Ahn, 2011; Yamashita, 1996). …",,10.1163/9789401209717_011,https://doi.org/10.1163/9789401209717_011,ancestry

"K. Tan, Atieh Farashaiyan",2012.0,The effectiveness of teaching formulaic politeness strategies in making request to undergraduates in an ESL classroom,"It is widely acknowledged that the main thrust of second language (L2) teaching and learning is establishing and developing the communicative competence of learners. Especially, in recent years, the focus has shifted more towards intercultural communicative competence (ICC). As such, it is more practical that educational endeavors should be directed both towards the grammar or lexis of the target language as well as the appropriate use of these grammatical and lexical systems in a variety of situations by considering different social and contextual factors. Therefore, this study embarks on the effect of explicit instruction of formulaic politeness strategies among Malaysian undergraduates in making request. Sixty Malaysian undergraduates participated in the study. The students included two groups of intervention and control groups. The data were cumulated through three tests, namely open ended completion test, a listening test and an acceptability judgment test. Treatment or experimental group received explicit instruction with structured and problem-solving and input tasks. The comparison was made between the performance of treatment group and that of control in terms of the pre-test and post-test. The findings show that the treatment group outperformed significantly than the control group. This matter is suggestive that in this probe, explicit form-based instruction was successful for learners to comprehend and produce the English politeness strategies effectively in making request. The findings of this study will be beneficial for material developers and teachers to make use of form-focused strategies more effectively to teach second language pragmatic features to Malaysian students.",,10.5539/ASS.V8N15P189,https://doi.org/10.5539/ASS.V8N15P189,ancestry

However, few studies examine the influence that instruction may have on the cognitive processes involved in speech act production (FelixBrasdefer, 2008). In order to address this research gap, and taking into account the discussion in research on the concept of attention and related terms such as awareness (see Al-Hejin, 2004, for a review of the role of attention and awareness in second language acquisition research) this paper reports on the benefits of instruction on learners’ attention and awareness during the performance of refusals. Thus, based on a pedagogical proposal for teaching refusals at the discourse level, we focus on the benefits that this pedagogical proposal can have on the information attended to during the planning and execution of refusals. Secondly, we explore whether instruction makes a difference in learners’ awareness of refusals.",,10.6018/IJES/2010/1/113981,https://doi.org/10.6018/IJES/2010/1/113981,ancestry

D. Yoshimi,2001.0,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: Explicit instruction and JFL learner's use of interactional discourse markers,"Introduction The development of L2 pragmatic competence entails the ability to use a wide range of conversational routines and discourse strategies to manage one's communicative interactions with others. Since the early 1980s, researchers have established that a foreign language learner's development of various aspects of pragmatic competence may be facilitated by the instruction of pragmatic routines and strategies in the foreign language classroom (Kasper, this volume). House (1996, p. 247) points out that when such instruction is explicit, it appears to be particularly beneficial since it enables learners to develop an awareness and understanding of the differences between L1 and L2 pragmatic preferences, and thereby “counteract negative L1 transfer through ‘noticing’ (Schmidt, 1993b) and through making attempts to use alternative, more L2 norm-oriented expressions.” In a comparison of the relative benefits of implicit and explicit instruction, House (1996) reports on two sections (i.e., implicit and explicit) of a 14-week communication course instructed in the use of everyday, conversational routines. Through lectures, handouts, and explanatory feedback that provided metapragmatic information on the use and function of these routines, the members of the explicit group had additional opportunities to raise their awareness of preferred L2 pragmatic practices and to “notice” differences between L1 and L2 practices. House argues that the greater improvement shown by the explicit group, particularly in areas where the pragmatic preferences of the learners' L1 differed from those of the target L2, is a result of the learners' heightened awareness of L1-L2 pragmatic differences.",,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.016,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139524797.016,ancestry

The study also found that teachers and textbooks use DE much more often than native speakers. Learners’ patterns of DE use closely follow those of their teachers and textbooks, suggesting the necessity of explicit instruction in sociolinguistic variants in L2 classrooms.",,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2009.00560.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-9922.2009.00560.X,ancestry

"Neil H. Johnson, J. deHaan",2013.0,Strategic Interaction 2.0: Instructed Intercultural Pragmatics in an EFL Context,"The potential of web-based 2.0 technology for teaching and assessing intercultural pragmatics has become an area of focus for language educators (Cohen, 2008; Belz, 2005, 2006). Research has highlighted that second and foreign language learners show significant differences from native speakers in language use, in particular, with the execution and comprehension of certain speech acts (Bardovi-Harlig & Mahan-Taylor, 2003). Without effective instruction, differences in pragmatics are evident in the English of learners regardless of their first language background or language proficiency. In EFL contexts, such as Japan, where learners have limited exposure to native speaker norms, teaching and learning pragmatic competence can be particularly challenging. The authors describe an ongoing curriculum development project in a Japanese university context, where the goal is to design and implement an effective approach to teaching interlanguage pragmatics. Digitally enhanced Strategic Interaction (SI) sequences (Di Pietro, 1987) provide opportunities for learners to engage in realistic interactive situations that are mediated by use of model conversations, an online wiki space, and digital video technologies. The online space provides opportunities for learner reflection, peer assisted feedback, and detailed intervention from the instructor. Data analysis from pre- and post- written discourse completion tasks suggests that learners are able to use language in more context sensitive ways having engaged with the teaching/learning cycle design.",,10.4018/jsita.2013010104,https://doi.org/10.4018/jsita.2013010104,ancestry

Naoko Taguchi,2007.0,Task Difficulty in Oral Speech Act Production,"This study took a pragmatic approach to examining the effects of task difficulty on L2 oral output. Twenty native English speakers and 59 Japanese students of English at two different proficiency levels produced speech acts of requests and refusals in a role play task. The task had two situation types based on three social variables: interlocutors� power difference (P), social distance (D), and the degree of imposition (R). In one situation type, the power relationship was equal, the distance was small, and the degree of imposition was small (PDR-low). In the other situation type, the listener had greater power, the distance was large, and the degree of imposition was also large (PDR-high). The participants� production was analyzed for overall appropriateness (rated on a 6-point scale), planning time, and speech rate. Results showed that L2 learners produced PDR-low speech acts significantly more easily and quickly, but little difference was observed in native speakers� production. There was a significant proficiency effect on appropriateness ratings and speech rate, but not on planning time. Post hoc analyses showed that each group demonstrated different patterns in the choice of linguistic expressions over the two situation types, indicating the noteworthy impact of situational variation on oral speech act production.",,10.1093/APPLIN/AML051,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/AML051,ancestry
"Eva Alcón-Soler, J. R. G. Pitarch",2013.0,The Effect of Instruction on Learners' Use and Negotiation of Refusals,"Research into Interlanguage Pragmatics has often focused on the effect of instruction on speech act production. However, features related to the interactive nature of conversation are rarely used in most of the pedagogical proposals for teaching the speech acts. Considering research outcomes on the benefits of pragmatic instruction, the need to conduct pragmatic intervention at the discourse level (Felix-Brasdefer, 2006b; Kasper, 2006) and the value of audiovisual input as a source of pragmatic input (Alcon, 2007; Fernandez-Guerra, 2008; Martinez-Flor, 2008), the present study focuses on the effect of instruction on learners' use of refusal strategies and concern for pragmatics. Alcon's (forthcoming) pedagogical proposal for teaching the speech act of refusals at the discourse level is used during the instructional treatment. In addition, pragmatic input is provided for the present study by means of scenes from the series Stargate, which were controlled for speech act type (refusals to requests) and social distance (+ power and + social distance). Findings from the study support Schmidt's (1993, 1995, 2001) noticing hypothesis, thus providing further evidence that high levels of attention-drawing activities are helpful for pragmatic learning. In addition to the differences as regards learners' use of refusal strategies, learners' attempts to accommodate the non-compliant nature of the speech act of refusals seem to have also been influenced by the teaching of refusals at the discourse level.1 IntroductionResearch into Interlanguage Pragmatics (ILP) has often focused on speech act production. Speech acts such as requests, apologies, complaints and refusals have received a great deal of attention over the years, but most of these studies ignore the interactive nature of conversation in their analyses of speech acts. Similarly, features related to the interactive nature of conversation are rarely used in most of the pedagogical proposals for teaching the speech acts or in most studies on speech act instruction (Martinez-Flor and Alcon, 2007, on suggestions; Olshtain and Cohen, 1990, on apologies; Rose and Ng Kwai-Fun, 2001, on compliments and compliment responses; Alcon, 2005, 2008; Martinez-Flor, 2007; Safont, 2005, 2007; Salazar, 2007; Takahashi, 2001; Uso-Juan, 2007, on requests; Kondo, 2008, on refusals). In addition, although results of these studies support Schmidt's (1993, 1995, 2001) noticing hypothesis and provide evidence of the positive effect of instruction (see also Alcon and MartinezFlor, 2005, 2008; Codina, 2008; Jeon and Kaya, 2006; Rose and Kasper, 2001; Takahashi, 2010), they ignore the interactive nature of conversation and the potential of teaching pragmatics at the discourse level.In the case of refusals, and as reported by Gass and Houck (1999: 2), the complexity of the speech act requires ""face-saving manoeuvres to accommodate the non-compliant nature of the act"". Most of the research on refusals has applied or adapted Beebe et a/.'s (1990) taxonomy, thereby focusing on semantic formulas, especially when dealing with learners or when contrasting NS and NNS use (see Al-Eryani, 2007; Al-Issa, 2003; AlKahtani, 2005; Felix-Brasdefer, 2003, 2006a; Geyang, 2007; Keshawarz, Eslami and Ghahraman, 2006; King and Silver, 1993; Kondo, 2001, 2008; Kwon, 2004; Salazar et al., 2009, among others). However, Felix-Brasdefer (2009) shows clearly that refusals function as a response to an initiating act and they are co-constructed by two or more interlocutors over multiple turns. In a similar line and in the area of language pedagogy, Felix-Brasdefer (2006b) and Alcon (forthcoming) present pedagogical models for teaching refusals at the discourse level. Felix-Brasdefer (2006b) presents three pedagogical sessions for teaching the negotiation of refusals across multiple turns in Spanish. The first one, communicative actions and cross-cultural awareness, focuses on cross-cultural awareness of refusing in English and Spanish, as well as providing pragmalinguistic input on refusals. …",,10.1163/9789401209717_005,https://doi.org/10.1163/9789401209717_005,ancestry

Additional strengths, such as increased statistical power, moderator analyses, and model testing, have also contributed to its appeal. The current review describes typical stages of a meta-analysis in second language acquisition (SLA) research: (a) defining the research domain, (b) developing a reliable coding scheme, (c) analyzing data, and (d) interpreting results. Each stage has a host of equally reasonable decisions that can be made; each decision will influence the conduct of the meta-analysis, the nature of the results, and the substantive implications of findings for SLA. We highlight a number of benefits and challenges that inform these decisions. In general, when a meta-analysis in applied linguistics is well planned, employs sound statistical methods, and is based on a thorough understanding of relevant theory, it can provide critical information that informs theory as well as future research, practice, and policy.",,10.1017/S0267190510000115,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190510000115,ancestry

Forty-four college students in a US institution completed three measures three times over a 4-month period: (a) the pragmatic listening test that measured the ability to comprehend implied speaker intentions, (b) the lexical access test that measured ability to make speedy semantic judgment, and (c) the language contact survey that examined the amount of time learners spent in L2 outside the class. The learners' pragmatic comprehension was analyzed for accuracy (the scores on the pragmatic listening test) and comprehension speed (the average time taken to answer items correctly). Results showed that the learners made significant improvement on comprehension speed but not on accuracy of comprehension. Lexical access speed was significantly correlated with comprehension speed but not with accuracy. The amount of speaking and reading outside class that the students reported on the language contact survey significantly correlated with the gains in comprehension speed but not with accuracy of comprehension.",,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00434.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00434.X,ancestry

Others have argued that recasts are ambiguous and may be perceived by the learner as confirmation of meaning rather than feedback on form (Lyster, 1998a). We review research on the effectiveness of recasts in first and second language acquisition, paying particular attention to how recasts have been defined and how their impact has been assessed in observational and experimental studies. We conclude that recasts appear to be most effective in contexts where it is clear to the learner that the recast is a reaction to the accuracy of the form, not the content, of the original utterance.",,10.1111/0023-8333.00172,https://doi.org/10.1111/0023-8333.00172,ancestry

A number of experimental studies have supported this claim, connecting interactional feedback with L2 development. Researchers have suggested that interactional feedback is associated with L2 learning because it prompts learners to notice L2 forms. This study explores the relationships between feedback, instructed ESL learners’ noticing of L2 form during classroom interactions and their subsequent L2 development. Interactional feedback was provided to learners in response to their production problems with questions, plurals, and past tense forms. Learners’ noticing was assessed through on-line learning journals, introspective comments while viewing classroom videotapes, and questionnaire responses. Through a controlled pre-test, post-test design, analyses of noticing and learning were carried out for each learner.

Hernandez,2011.0,Re-examining the role of explicit instruction and input flood on the acquisition of Spanish discourse markers,"Expanding on the studies of Hernández (2008) and de la Fuente (2009), this investigation examines the combined effect of explicit instruction (EI) and input flood (IF) vs. IF alone on students’ use of discourse markers to narrate a past event. Participants included 91 English-speaking adults enrolled in fourth-semester college Spanish courses, assigned to the EI + IF group (n = 36), the IF group (n = 30), or the control group (n = 25). The EI + IF group was provided with EI on the function and use of discourse markers. This group also received a flood of input containing the target forms. Students were provided with communicative practice and feedback. In contrast, the IF group did not receive EI + IF on the use of discourse markers. This group received the same flood of input as the EI group. The IF group was presented with communicative practice although there was no feedback. Results of a speaking task administered as a pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test indicated that both treatments had a positive effect on students’ use of discourse markers. Discourse transcripts show that the EI + IF group used more discourse markers to shape their output in student— student communicative exchanges than the IF group. Taken together, results suggest that the combined effect of EI and IF was not superior to IF alone in promoting student use of discourse markers as measured on the post-test speaking tasks.",,10.1177/1362168810388694,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362168810388694,ancestry

Since findings in CA describe systematic action sequences underlying verbal activities that display cross-cultural variation, they capture pragmatics in its most natural locus: the conversational encounter. It will furthermore be demonstrated that L2 learners may benefit from instruction with CA-based materials with the ability to anticipate, interpret and produce, socio-pragmatically appropriate verbal behaviour in the target language. CA-based materials thus provide a rich resource for language teachers based on solid empirical evidence, and effectively enable L2 learners to engage in cross-culturally variable language behaviour inside and outside of class.",,10.1191/1362168806lr184oa,https://doi.org/10.1191/1362168806lr184oa,ancestry
R. Ellis,1992.0,Learning to Communicate in the Classroom,"It is now generally accepted that second language (L2) acquisition can take place as a result of learning how to communicate in the L2. It is less clear, however, whether the kind of communication that occurs in a classroom is sufficient to ensure development of full target language competence. This article examines the extent to which the opportunities for communication in an English as a Second Language (ESL) classroom result in the acquisition of one particular illocutionary act—requests. A total of 410 requests produced by two child learners over 15–21 months were examined. The results suggest that although considerable development took place over this period, both learners failed to develop either the full range of request types or a broad linguistic repertoire for performing those types that they did acquire. The learners also failed to develop the sociolinguistic competence needed to vary their choice of request to take account of different addressees. One explanation for these results is that although the classroom context fostered interpersonal and expressive needs in the two learners, it did not provide the conditions for real sociolinguistic needs.",,10.1017/S0272263100010445,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263100010445,ancestry

G. Kasper,2001.0,Four perspectives on L2 pragmatic development,"L2 learners' development of pragmatic ability has been studied from a variety of theoretical perspectives. This paper seeks to assess the contributions made by different approaches to interlanguage pragmatics as a subfield of Second Language Acquisition. A first approach locates the development of pragmatic ability within a comprehensive model of communicative competence, either examining pragmatics as an autonomous component or in its interaction with grammatical ability. The discussion focuses on the evidence for and against the interdependence of pragmatic and grammatical ability. A second perspective explores pragmatic learning as information processing, with a particular view to the roles of attention, awareness, input, and metapragmatic knowledge. One important question requiring further exploration is whether principles of grammar learning extend to the learning of pragmatics. A third approach investigates pragmatic learning in sociocultural perspective. A key observation has been that pragmatic knowledge emerges from assisted performance, both in student-teacher and peer interaction. The fourth approach is language socialization, investigating how cultural and pragmatic knowledge are jointly acquired through learners' participation in recurring situated activities. In a final section, the paper discusses whether the four perspectives are compatible or mutually exclusive.",,10.1093/APPLIN/22.4.502,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/22.4.502,ancestry

P. Robinson,1995.0,"Attention, Memory, and the “Noticing” Hypothesis","Schmidt (1990) claimed that consciousness, in the sense of awareness of the form of input at the level of “noticing”, is necessary to subsequent second language acquisition (SLA). This claim runs counter to Krashen's (1981) dualsystem hypothesis that SLA largely results from an unconscious “acquisition” system, the contribution of the conscious “learning” system to SLA being limited and peripheral. Important to a theory of SLA that allows a central role to the act of noticing is a specification of the nature of the attentional mechanisms involved, and of their relationship to current models of the organization of memory. With this in mind the present paper reviews current research into the nature of attention and memory and proposes a model of the relationship between them during SLA that, it is argued, is complementary to Schmidt's noticing hypothesis and oppositional to the dual-system hypothesis of Krashen. In light of this model, I argue that differential performance on implicit and explicit learning and memory experiments is caused by differences in the consciously regulated processing demands of training tasks and not by the activation of consciously and unconsciously accessed systems. I also argue that the attentional demands of pedagogical tasks and individual differences in memory and attentional capacity both affect the extent of noticing, thereby directly influencing SLA.",,10.1111/J.1467-1770.1995.TB00441.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-1770.1995.TB00441.X,ancestry

The relationship between second language (L2) comprehensibility and pragmatics is explored in two experiments involving instruction of speech acts to learners enrolled in a Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada program. The study was designed to determine whether improved pragmatic competence results in enhanced comprehensibility (how easy L2 speech is to understand). Two intact classes participated; one received 25 hours of pragmatics instruction, while the control group received the standard curriculum (no focus on pragmatics). Both classes were recorded in role-plays based on several scenarios at pre- and post-test. Transcriptions of the role-plays were coded according to a rubric; although the control group showed superior performance at the outset, the experimental group’s scores exceeded those of the Control group at post-test with a medium effect size. A subset of pre- and posttest role-plays (two refusals and two requests) were randomly assigned to 56 native English listeners who rated the speech samples for social appropriateness, comprehensibility, and fluency. The experimental group’s posttest productions on all scenarios were perceived as significantly more socially appropriate, with three scenarios showing significant improvement in comprehensibility. Although one scenario improved in fluency, another showed a decline. The results suggest that pragmatics instruction enhances L2 speech comprehensibility.",,10.1075/AP.20001.DER,https://doi.org/10.1075/AP.20001.DER,forward

The scholarly evidence seemingly indicates that both L2 learners of English and Japanese can acquire and adopt pragmatically correct refusal and indirect opinion utterances and strategies, either through explicit instruction, or incidentally through target language (TL) immersion environments. Nevertheless, advanced levels of general TL language proficiency do not always appear to correlate to corresponding levels of pragmatic competence or fluency in the specific areas examined.

Vahid Rafieyan,2016.0,Bridging Pragmatic Gap in Translation Process through Developing Pragmatic Awareness,"In order for the translator to be able to translate the source text into the target language in a relevant way, the strata of the translated text through which relevance can be obtained (pragmatic, pragmatic-semantic, and semantic strata) should be equalized to that of the source text (Li & Luo, 2004). The translator can achieve this by raising his/her awareness of the source and target language pragmatic perspectives. To investigate the actual effect of developing knowledge of pragmatic perspectives of the source language and the target language on the quality of translation of culture-bound texts, the current study was conducted on 64 Iranian undergraduate students of English translation. The study consisted of three phases: 1) administering a culture-bound text to be translated by all participants, 2) dividing participants into two groups: one merely receiving translation exercises while the other receiving metapragmatic discussions of the pragmatic perspectives of the source language along with translation exercises, and 3) assessing the translation quality of both groups immediately and two months following the treatment. The study revealed the significant positive effect of pragmatic instruction on improving the quality of translation of culture-bound texts and maintaining the obtained knowledge.

Syamimi Turiman,2020.0,Use of Discourse Marker ‘so’ in the Malaysian ESL Job Interviews,"The discourse marker ‘so’ has been identified as being typically high in spoken discourse, but previous studies have been focusing on its use in the oral production of native speakers. This paper explores the use of ‘so’, concentrating on job interview speech in the Malaysian English as a Second Language (ESL) context. It aims to explicate the multifunctional uses of ‘so’ in a self-developed corpus made up of 16 actual job interviews conducted in English, comprising job interviews in two different organizations in Malaysia. In the corpus, ‘so’ is identified as the tenth most frequent word, which also makes it the most-used discourse marker in the job interview speech. The results suggest that ‘so’ in the corpus serves five main functions, namely 1) to introduce summary; 2) to continue previous speaker’s topic; 3) to mark sequential relations; 4) to hold the floor; and 5) to introduce elaboration to justify a prior statement. Interestingly, when ‘so’ is used in turn-initials, it points to a specific function which is 6) to introduce new information. However, it was also found that the high frequency of ‘so’ in the corpus is associated with ‘pseudo-bridging’ whereby ‘so’ is simply used to 7) add new information and making speech seem coherent. The study implies that the teaching of discourse markers in speech, specifically the use of ‘so’ should focus more on the pragmatic functions than on semantic meanings per se, to avoid the inappropriate or overuse of this particular linguistic element.",,10.15282/IJLEAL.V10.4212,https://doi.org/10.15282/IJLEAL.V10.4212,forward

Pragmatic competence encompasses the ability to understand and use language appropriately in diverse social and cultural contexts, including mastering speech acts, politeness strategies, conversational implicatures, and intercultural pragmatics. Despite its importance, pragmatic competence often receives less attention in language instruction compared to grammar and vocabulary. The review highlights the effectiveness of explicit and implicit teaching methods, authentic interaction, and cultural immersion in developing pragmatic skills. It also underscores the role of technology, such as digital platforms and simulations, in enhancing learners’ ability to navigate real-life communication scenarios. 
The findings reveal significant challenges, including cultural variability in pragmatic norms, difficulties in standardizing assessments, and the influence of learners’ individual differences. The study calls for innovative teaching and evaluation methods, focusing on personalized approaches and the integration of pragmatic learning with emotional intelligence. By synthesizing current research and practices, this article provides valuable insights for educators, curriculum developers, and researchers, advocating for adaptive, culturally informed, and technology-supported strategies to enhance pragmatic competence in SLA.",,10.61132/sintaksis.v3i1.1291,https://doi.org/10.61132/sintaksis.v3i1.1291,forward

A seven-point scale was used to assess grammatical competence in a different way to previous studies, which generally equate grammar with proficiency levels. The study describes the interface between the acquisition of grammar items and the development of pragmatic competence. The results show that as the learners become more grammatically competent, they tend to use more elaborate requests and responses and more pragmatically appropriate utterances. Further evidence is, therefore, provided to the parallel development of grammar and pragmatics in a context that has received little attention so far.

Misty So-Sum Wai-Cook,2012.0,Study Abroad and Its Effect on the Pragmatic Performance of English Requests by Hong Kong English Language Students,"This thesis investigates the study abroad experience and its effect on the pragmatic development of second language learners. The research first describes affective and environmental dimensions of the study abroad experience as undertaken by a group of Hong Kong learners over a nine-month period of study at an Australian university. Second, it investigates changes in the way these learners performed requests in English over the duration of the study abroad experience. This data provides insights into their pragmatic development in English. Comparisons of request devices were made with a matched group of learners who continued their studies in Hong Kong and with a group of Australian native speakers. Finally the research examines the relationship between affective and environmental dimensions of the study abroad experience and changes in the performance of requests across the nine month study abroad period by the learners. This research takes a quantitative and qualitative approach to data analysis. A quantitative approach, using inferential statistics (ANOVA) was used to analyse learner self-report data gathered before and during the study abroad period using the Language Contact Profile. This data included information on time spent interacting or listening in English, attitudes and reasons for learning English, perceptions of the target language community, perceptions of Australia, self-rated proficiency and self-rated confidence scores. Similarly, inferential statistics (ANOVA and chi-square tests) were used to analyse and compare request performances obtained through oral Enhanced Discourse Completion Tests (EDCTs) and role-plays by three groups: the study abroad learners; an equivalent group of students in Hong Kong; and by a group of Australian native speakers. Finally, Spearman’s rho correlation was used to analyse the relationship between study abroad learners’ pragmatic performance and the affective and environmental dimensions of their experience. Qualitative data in the form of interview data and student entries in introspective diaries was collected to provide in-depth explanations for responses to the oral EDCTs and role-plays. Three main findings emerged from this study. The first finding relates to the environmental and affective dimensions of learners’ study abroad experience. Analyses revealed that, unsurprisingly, there was an overall increase in the number of hours study abroad learners listened and interacted face-to-face in English. Nevertheless, this increase plateaued after the first four months of learners’ sojourn in Australia and their interactions were mostly with other English learners who were their classmates, flat mates or friends through the Hong Kong Association at the university. These findings suggest learners established their network of friends in the first months of their sojourn in Australia, and it was unlikely learners went beyond this circle of friends during their stay in Australia. Thus, learners’ contact with fluent/native English speakers was limited. Additionally, and contrary to the common belief that there is a ‘homestay advantage’, learners living with a host family did not necessarily have more face-to-face interaction with fluent/native English speakers than those living in a student dormitory. Interaction between the host and the learner depended heavily on the individual learner’s attitude towards the host family. Furthermore, learners’ English input and face-to-face interaction correlated significantly with the increase in learners’ self-perceived confidence in speaking, communication and grammar, but not self-perceived proficiency. The second main finding concerns the pragmatic performance of English requests by at-home and study abroad learners, focusing specifically on three features of requests: request heads, softeners and external modifications. Results showed no change in the occurrence of these three features in requests made by the at-home learners at the beginning of the data collection period and again four months later. Similarly there was no change in the type of request heads and softeners used by the study abroad learners by the end of ninth months study in Australia. However, they had begun to use some of the request external modifiers that were frequently employed by native speakers of Australian English and used significantly more request external modifiers. These results lend support to the Complexification Hypothesis (Trosborg 1995) because learners first used the more routinised features before developing proficiency in the non-formulaic features of request external modifiers. More importantly, this study offered further support for the Bulge Theory (Wolfson 1986). The results in this study indicated that after nine months of being in Australia, the learners used a less familiar structure ‘conventional indirect request’ in close distance situations, such as with friends. However, in maximum social distance interactions between higher and lower status interlocutors, the learners employed direct requests to reduce cognitive burden to free more processing capacity for using external modifiers to express politeness. The third main finding relates to the effect of environmental and affective factors on the study abroad learners’ performance of English request devices. This study showed the number of request external modifiers study abroad learners used significantly increased with time. Furthermore, the results showed that by the end of the nine months, the number of request external modifiers study abroad learners used correlated significantly with a number of environmental and affective factors: learners’ overall English input, learners’ face-to-face interaction with English speakers in the living environment, as well as learners’ self-perceived proficiency and self-perceived confidence in speaking and communication, but not with their self-perceived proficiency in grammar. Overall, the research shows that learners can improve their pragmatic performance through exposure to English in the target language community in ways that are not seen in the language development of learners learning in an English as a foreign language setting. However, the results also show that study abroad learners may have quite limited opportunities to interact with English speakers during their sojourn abroad.",,10.26686/wgtn.17000731.v1,https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17000731.v1,forward

R. Mapson,2015.0,Paths to politeness: exploring how professional interpreters develop an understanding of politeness norms in British Sign Language and English,": This chapter explores how bimodal bilinguals acquire and develop their awareness of politeness in British Sign Language (BSL). Drawing on data collected through semi-structured group discussions involving eight highly experienced BSL/English interpreters the chapter focuses on how the participants learned about linguistic politeness in BSL and how this contrasts with their acquisition of English politeness norms. The data indicate how di ﬀ erent paths to the acquisition of linguistic politeness might a ﬀ ect understanding of it. The experience of interpreters from Deaf family backgrounds, who acquired BSL as their ﬁ rst language, contrasts with those who learned BSL formally, as an additional language, as adults. Although both groups of participants acquired knowledge of politeness in similar arenas, the languages they were exposed to in these environments di ﬀ ered and intra-group experiences were heterogeneous. The data highlight the di ﬃ culty of learning politeness norms in an L2, with participants reporting a lack of explicit focus on politeness in BSL classes and interpreter training programmes. This may re ﬂ ect the lack of literature on polite-ness in signed language, and on BSL in particular. Both groups of interpreters reported experiences involving the negative transfer of L1 politeness norms. Data indicate that the di ﬀ erent modalities of BSL and English may facilitate transferability rather than restrict it, with one a ﬀ ordance being the ‘ blended transfer ’ of non-manual politeness features associated with BSL which may be performed simultaneously with spoken English.",,10.1515/9781501501654-007,https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501501654-007,forward

Explicit instruction has been proposed by some scholars as an effective approach to make EFL writers aware of the importance, different forms, and pragmatic functions of hedging devices some of which are polysemous and polypragmatics (e.g., Hyland 1996a). The present study with the aim of shedding more light on the effectiveness of explicit instruction in improving the pragmatic knowledge of Iranian EFL learners in terms of hedging devices, investigates the acquisition and use of English modal auxiliaries as hedging strategies via applying a direct teaching strategy in the classroom. To this end a sample of 37 undergraduate students majoring in different fields of study were recruited and assigned into a control and experimental group. Explicit instruction of the modal auxiliaries as hedging resources was applied for the treatment group while the control group received only the regular academic writing instruction. A pretest and a posttest were administered to the two groups. The descriptive analysis of the scores as well as the results of the t-tests revealed a significant progress in the participants’ linguistic and pragmatic knowledge of modal auxiliaries as hedges in the treatment group.

"Luke Plonsky, F. Oswald",2014.0,How Big Is “Big”? Interpreting Effect Sizes in L2 Research,"The calculation and use of effect sizes—such as d for mean differences and r for correlations—has increased dramatically in second language (L2) research in the last decade. Interpretations of these effects, however, have been rare and, when present, have largely defaulted to Cohen's levels of small (d = .2, r = .1), medium (.5, .3), and large (.8, .5), which were never intended as prescriptions but rather as a general guide. As Cohen himself and many others have argued, effect sizes are best understood when interpreted within a particular discipline or domain. This article seeks to promote more informed and field-specific interpretations of d and r by presenting a description of L2 effects from 346 primary studies and 91 meta-analyses (N > 604,000). Results reveal that Cohen's benchmarks generally underestimate the effects obtained in L2 research. Based on our analysis, we propose a field-specific scale for interpreting effect sizes, and we outline eight key considerations for gauging relative magnitude and practical significance in primary and secondary studies, such as theoretical maturity in the domain, the degree of experimental manipulation, and the presence of publication bias.",,10.1111/LANG.12079,https://doi.org/10.1111/LANG.12079,forward

"A. Mirzaei, Mahmood Hashemian, Amin Khoramshekouh",2016.0,L2 Learners’ Enhanced Pragmatic Comprehension of Implicatures via Computer-Mediated Communication and Social Media Networks,"Second or foreign language (L2) learners‘ development of interlanguage pragmatic (ILP) competence to understand and properly interpret utterances under certain social and cultural circumstances plays a pivotal role in the achievement of communicative competence. The current study was designed to explore the effects of synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) and asynchronous computer-mediated communication (ACMC) course modules delivered through social media networks (SMN) on the development of the Iranian L2 learners‘ comprehension of implicatures. The participants of the study were 90 English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) undergraduate students attending three intact classes. The classes were randomly assigned to one control and two experimental (SCMC and ACMC) groups. An open-ended implicature comprehension test was used to assess students‘ ILP development in this pretest-posttest comparison-group study. The control group received the traditional teacher-fronted instruction, and the S/ACMC groups received instruction via synchronous and asynchronous modules of SMNs for 4 months, respectively. Students‘ attitudes towards the CMC-based courses were also sought. Split-plot ANOVA results indicated that both experimental groups developed significant ILP ability to comprehend and interpret L2 implicatures after the instruction; however, by comparison, the ACMC group improved more considerably. It is concluded that, first, comprehending L2 implicatures is not impervious to computer-mediated instruction and, second, different CMC affordances may result in differential ILP developmental effects in teaching L2 pragmatics. The findings can help L2 teachers decide how to use CMC affordances and SMN modules to raise L2 learners‘ pragmatic awareness.",,10.18869/ACADPUB.IJAL.19.1.141,https://doi.org/10.18869/ACADPUB.IJAL.19.1.141,forward
"Z. Tajeddin, Rasoul Mohammad Hosseinpur",2014.0,"The Impact of Deductive, Inductive, and L1-Based Consciousness-Raising Tasks on EFL Learners' Acquisition of the Request Speech Act","The necessity and importance of teaching pragmatics has come to light by many researchers (e.g. Rose & Kasper, 2001). Due to the consensus over the need to teach pragmatic competence, the main issue now centers on the question of how we should teach this competence in the most effective way. Consistent with this line of research, the present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of deductive, inductive, and L1-based consciousness-raising instructional tasks on EFL learners' acquisition of the request speech act during a seven-week instruction period. The results obtained through a written DCT administered to 140 EFL learners indicated that instruction had a significantly positive effect on learners' acquisition of the request speech act. The comparison of the task types demonstrated that, all in all, the deductive task was the most effective one. Furthermore, the results showed that the learners were generally receptive to L1-based awareness-raising tasks and that these tasks were more effective than inductive tasks. This study suggests that consciousness-raising instructional tasks could be utilized in raising students’ sociopragmatic awareness and be applied in helping them develop their interlanguage pragmatics.",,10.22099/JTLS.2014.2022,https://doi.org/10.22099/JTLS.2014.2022,forward

"A. Barron, Klaus P. Schneider",2009.0,Variational pragmatics: Studying the impact of social factors on language use in interaction,"Intercultural pragmatics is usually associated with pragmatic di¤erences between di¤erent languages. This seems to be the default reading of the term. However, this reading tacitly ignores that there is no one-to-one relationship between languages and cultures.1 Speakers who share the same native language do not necessarily share the same culture. For instance, native speakers of English in Ireland and the United States use language in di¤erent ways (e.g., Schneider 1999, 2008). Neither do Americans in the US all use English in the same way (cf., e.g., Barron 2009; Wolfram and Schilling 2006: 93–101). On the other hand, cultures may be shared by speakers with di¤erent native languages. Thus, as language use in interaction is shaped by cultural values, pragmatic similarities may occur across languages, while pragmatic di¤erences may occur across varieties of the same language. Variational pragmatics is a subdiscipline of intercultural pragmatics. Other subdisciplines include contrastive pragmatics, cross-cultural pragmatics, ethnopragmatics, interlanguage pragmatics, and postcolonial pragmatics. Contrastive pragmatics is concerned with inter-lingual di¤erences, i.e., with pragmatic variation between di¤erent languages. Crosscultural pragmatics, on the other hand, compares the ways in which different languages are used in communication. It also deals with native speaker—non-native speaker interaction and with lingua franca communication (cf. Blum-Kulka et al. 1989; House-Edmondson 1986: 282).2 Ethnopragmatics is concerned with explaining speech practices in terms of a culture-internal perspective (e.g., in terms of values) rather than in terms of presumed pragmatic universals (cf. Goddard 2006). Interlanguage pragmatics focuses on the specific nature of language use conventions in learner language, e.g., in the English as a foreign language spoken by native speakers of German, and also on the acquisition of these conventions by learners (cf. Kasper 1998; Kasper and Rose 1999; Barron 2003: 26–28). The use of second (as opposed to foreign) languages in interaction is studied in postcolonial pragmatics.

"Abdullah Sarani, Ali Malmir",2020.0,Multiple Intelligences as Predictors of Foreign Language Pragmatic Knowledge: The Case of Five Frequent English Speech Acts,"Because of the important role of multiple intelligences (MIs) in learning a second/foreign langue (L2) as supported by the existing second language acquisition (SLA) literature, some pragmatic scholars have asked for studying their contribution to pragmatic competence (e.g., Taguchi & Roever, 2017). Accordingly, the present investigation has attempted to examine the relationship between L2 learners’ multiple intelligences and their speech-act pragmatic performance. A sample of 124 EFL students who were selected from an initial sample of 206 learners at two Iranian state universities based on their scores on the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency (MTELP) took part in this study. The data collection procedure was done in two subsequent phases. First, McKenzie's (1999) multiple intelligences (MI) survey including 90 items was filled out by the participants. Then, a validated 50-item multiple-choice discourse completion test (MDCT) including five frequent English speech acts (requests, apologies, refusals, complaints, and compliments/compliment responses) was administered. Data analysis using multiple regression revealed that four of the intelligence including logical, interpersonal, verbal, and intrapersonal intelligences were significant predictors of L2 learners' speech-act pragmatic knowledge. Among these four intelligences, verbal intelligence was the strongest followed by interpersonal, intrapersonal, and logical intelligences. However, five other intelligences (i.e., naturalistic, musical, existential, visual, & kinesthetic intelligences were not significant predictors of L2 pragmatic performance). These findings can have some pedagogical implications for EFL teachers in helping their learners develop their speech-act pragmatic knowledge based on their MIs.",,10.22132/TEL.2020.107876,https://doi.org/10.22132/TEL.2020.107876,forward

Participants were divided into two groups with 30 students each. Group A comprised students who are majoring in English and enrolled at the Department of English whereas group B included students who studied English as an ESP course at the Department of Tourism. Data were collected using a 12-item Oral discourse completion task (Oral DCT) questionnaire. Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics like frequencies, mean scores and percentages. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted as well to judge statistical significance between contextual variables and categories of refusal and acceptance strategies. Findings indicated that Egyptian EFL learners varied in adopting acceptance strategies, however they tended to use similar strategies for refusing invitations. The study emphasizes the needs of teaching pragmatic behavior to Egyptian EFL tertiary students. Social contextual variables were found to have statistically significant influence on the selection of refusal and acceptance strategies adopted by Egyptian EFL students.",,10.21608/jrciet.2020.117119,https://doi.org/10.21608/jrciet.2020.117119,forward
D. J. Cunningham,2016.0,Request Modification in Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication: The Role of Focused Instruction.,"The pairing of telecollaboration and focused instruction can lead to measurable gains in second language learners' pragmatic competence (Belz & Vyatkina, , ; Vyatkina & Belz, ). This article examines speech act production in telecollaborative exchange, focusing on the requesting behavior of American learners of German for professional purposes as they interacted with German-speaking professionals in Germany via synchronous Web conferences. Drawing on quantitative and qualitative methods, the study investigated the effect of interaction with expert speakers and the implementation of focused instruction on learners' pragmatic development. Whereas quantitative analysis showed no change between experimental conditions, qualitative analysis of 4 learners' request production over the course of 4 online discussions revealed idiosyncratic developmental pathways and the emergence of a common strategy for managing participation in oral synchronous computer-mediated communication. The findings provide new insight regarding the nature of second language request production and confirm the utility of pragmatics instruction in telecollaboration. At the same time, the study calls for more refined analytical tools when investigating language development in extended telecollaborative discourse.

Developing pragmatic competence needs experience, knowledge and language awareness. According to Fasold (2006) pragmatics involves using language in particular situations. In this review the speech act of complimenting is selected as the focus of teaching. People compliment each other to maintain or create a special relationship to improve their actions. The early studies by Manes and Wolfson (1981) report the formulaicity of compliments in American English. Finally, this review shows that teachers should pay more attention to pragmatics and teaching it in the classroom. Lack of pragmatic knowledge may cause a failure in communication. Besides emphasizing on only grammar aspects teachers should teach the appropriate usage of language in different situations.",,10.5296/JSEL.V3I1.7890,https://doi.org/10.5296/JSEL.V3I1.7890,forward

Twelve highly proficient learners of English completed six simulated conversations focused on making requests in academic contexts. Evidence of learning was examined microgenetically by comparing data across the simulated conversations and triangulated by written reflections, surveys, and interviews. Results showed that participants gained content and linguistic forms from expert speaker models, and their interactions in scenario-based simulations indicated greater pragmatic awareness and changes in oral production over time.

Based on the limitations in the way IFL textbooks present requests, instructional material was designed with the following objectives: to improve learners’ pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic competences and to raise their awareness of request realisation across different contexts. The material, designed for a 60-minute pedagogical intervention, was then used in an Italian language school in Sao Paulo with five intact classes of beginner Brazilian learners of Italian. We implemented a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental methodological design, where three classes were randomly selected to serve as the experimental group, and two classes served as the control group. The data collected through written DCTs and simplified retrospective questionnaires revealed that the learners in the experimental group showed a more significant improvement in their socio pragmatic, pragmalinguistic and metapragmatic competence compared to the control group. These results suggest a positive effect of consciousness-raising activities on learners’ declarative knowledge in the short term.",,10.1558/ISLA.18240,https://doi.org/10.1558/ISLA.18240,forward

"Rasoul Mohammad Hosseinpur, Reza Bagheri Nevisi",2017.0,"Willingness to Communicate, Learner Subjectivity, Anxiety, and EFL Learners' Pragmatic Competence",": Individual learner differences play an integral role in second language acquisition and interested researchers and practitioners cannot get a full appreciation of second language learning if they ignore these significant variables. This study investigated how willingness to communicate (WTC), learner subjectivity, and anxiety in learning the L2 correlate with Iranian students’ English pragmatic knowledge. To this end, a total of 140 participants received instruction on request strategy types and their internal and external modification devices for seven weeks through consciousness-raising tasks. The data were obtained through WTC questionnaire, learner subjectivity questionnaire, foreign language classroom anxiety scale, and discourse completion test. The findings indicated that WTC and learner subjectivity correlated positively with the participants’ L2 pragmatic competence. However, no relationship was observed between the learners’ anxiety and their pragmatic achievement. The results suggest that some personal characteristics such as WTC and learner subjectivity are significant contributors to success in acquiring L2 pragmatic knowledge. چکیده: تفاوت های فردی زبان آموزان نقش غیر قابل انکاری در یادگیری زبان دوم ایفا میکنند و محققان علاقه مند نخواهند توانست به درک کامل و درستی از یادگیری زبان دوم برسند اگر چنین متغیرهای مهمی را نادیده بگیرند. این مطالعه به بررسی چگونگی ارتباط تمایل به برقراری ارتباط کلامی (WTC)،  فردیت زبان آموز و اضطراب در یادگیری زبان دوم با دانش منظور شناسی زبان آموزان ایرانی می پردازد. برای این منظور، در مجموع 140 نفر در مورد انواع استراتژی های درخواست و ابزارهای اصلاحی داخلی و خارجی آنها برای هفت هفته از طریق وظایف آگاهی-دهنده (آگاهی برانگیز) مورد آموزش قرار گرفتند. داده ها با استفاده از پرسشنامه های تمایل به برقراری ارتباط کلامی، فردیت، مقیاس اضطراب در کلاس های زبان خارجی و آزمون تکمیل گفتمان جمع آوری گردیدند. یافته های تحقیق حاکی از این داشتند که تمایل به برقراری ارتباط کلامی و فردیت زبان آموزان به طور مثبت با توانایی منظور شناسی آنها در زبان دوم ارتباط داشت. با این وجود، بین اضطراب زبان آموزان و توانایی منظور شناسی آنها در زبان دوم ارتباطی مشاهده نشد. نتایج نشان می دهند که برخی ویژگی های شخصی مانند تمایل به برقراری ارتباط کلامی و فردیت زبان آموزان از اهمیت ویژه و نقش بسزایی درکسب موفقیت آمیز دانش منظور شناسی در زبان دوم برخوردار است. واژگان کلیدی:تمایل به برقراری ارتباط کلامی، فردیت، اضطراب، درخواست، توانایی منظور شناسی",,10.22108/ARE.2017.78045.0,https://doi.org/10.22108/ARE.2017.78045.0,forward

Kamal Hasan Jawad,2021.0,Condolence in Classroom Teaching: Iraqi EFL University Students' Pragmatic Deviation,"Research studies concerning pragmatic acquisition by students have established that  pragmatic nonconformity or deviation in the execution  of speech acts, among which is ""condolence"", is primarily due to  the students' incompetence to identify the proper meaning and to handle the proper form. In Iraqi context, most Iraqi EFL university students are found to inapproriately use illocutionary acts, as they digress from the sociocultural standards and pragmalinguistic rules used for making condolence. When producing circumstances comprising the use of the expressive condolence, students' speeches and responses do not conform to those of native speakers. Their replies seem awkward or refer to certain spoken situations other than those required in the communicative process or interaction. Thus, the study intends to identify Iraqi EFL students' deviation in the performance of the expressive condolence in order to get at the reasons behind this unconventionality. To achieve this aim, fifty Iraqi EFL college students of the University of Baghdad , College of Languages, Department of English, have been chosen to give ( data) replies to a test containing five situtations involving the production of condolence. Responses to the test have shown that negative transfer of L1 socio-pragmatic knowledge and lack of pragma-linguistic rules are the main characteristics that EFL Iraqi students resort to when handling condolence. Socio-pragmatic deviation occurs because they are linguistically unconscious of the conventions and means used in the target language; therefore, their performance is a non-native one. Further, lack of syntactic and semantic knowledge is an influential factor in producing certain spoken situations of condoling.",,10.17762/PAE.V58I1.1290,https://doi.org/10.17762/PAE.V58I1.1290,forward

Pragmática sociocultural: estudios del discurso de cortesía en español. Barcelona: Ariel). Dentro de los estudios de orientación pragmática de mayor difusión entre los académicos, encontramos dos posiciones, por un lado la de autores como Leech (([1983] 1988). Principles of Pragmatics. London: Longman.) y Brown y Levinson ([1978] 1987. Politeness. Some Universals in Language Use. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.), que asumen que determinados actos de habla serían inherentemente amenazantes para la mantención de la imagen social (face); por otro, la de Thomas ((1983). Cross-cultural pragmatic failure. Applied Linguistics, 4 (2), pp. 91–112.), Wierzbicka ((1991). Cross-cultural pragmatics. The Semantics of Human Interaction.

Applied Linguistics, (5), pp. 196–213.), entre otros, para quienes la percepción de los mismos actos en distintas culturas estaría influida por factores socioculturales, de manera que los actos de habla no serían per se amenazantes, sino que esta condición dependería de su interpretación en contexto. Creemos que los actos se describen de modo distinto dependiendo de cuál sea el contexto del usuario ideal, término que refiere al uso habitual de la lengua en su contexto situacional y sociocultural. Por ello sostenemos que no basta con interpretar los actos con la sola ayuda de la bibliografía y de las propias intuiciones, sino que es necesario consultar al usuario de la lengua. En este artículo nos enfocaremos en justificar una metodología de recogida de datos socio-pragmáticos que establece relaciones directas entre los actos y los hábitos sociales de sus usuarios. Nos basaremos en un método de consulta usado por varios autores, el cuestionario de hábitos sociales (cf. Hernández Flores, (2002). La cortesía en la conversación española de familiares y amigos.

Thirty students enrolled in Chinese classes in a U.S. university interacted with characters in videos featuring scenes recorded in Shanghai. Students were prompted to use formulaic expressions during their text-based interactions with built-in characters. Several game-like features were incorporated into the practice (e.g., a plot and settings, character selections, and point systems). Pre-, post-, and delayed posttest results showed that students made significant gains in their knowledge of formulaic expressions after the practice, and their knowledge was maintained 2 weeks later. Interviews with individual students revealed some features that motivated them with the practice (e.g., videorecordings of authentic situations, interactions with the characters). However, some students did not perceive the practice as a game-like experience because of the linear, structured nature of the practice and limited decision-making power, leaving room for design improvement in the future.",,10.1111/FLAN.12292,https://doi.org/10.1111/FLAN.12292,forward

Importance of multi-word chunks in facilitating communicative competence and its pedagogic implications. The Language Teacher 24(12). 5–11; Rose, K. R. 1999. Teachers and students learning about requests in Hong Kong. In E. Hinkel (Ed.), Culture in second language teaching and learning, 167–180. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.). Accordingly, the present study aimed at investigating the influence of contrastive lexical approach (CLA), in comparison with explicit and implicit approaches, on Iranian EFL learners’ pragmatic competence. Sixty-three participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and received dissimilar instructional treatments for ten 30-minute sessions. A pretest-posttest equivalent-groups research design was carried out and pretest scores were used as the covariate in a one-way ANCOVA data analysis. CLA showed no significant advantage over the other two methods. Previous studies have often combined a contrastive method with explicit teaching. Confounding variables in this way may have made interpretation of results problematic. In the present research explicit and contrastive instructions were kept separate and no significant difference was found between the three treatments, although all instruction types enhanced the language learners’ pragmatic competence. As a result, a pragmatic teaching course is recommended which incorporates the useful teaching techniques and practices of these three approaches to teaching pragmatic competence.",,10.1515/IRAL-2016-0018,https://doi.org/10.1515/IRAL-2016-0018,forward

The second section discusses on the development of socio-pragmatic competence through Facebook. The article argues that the development of socio-pragmatic competence via Facebook’s distinctive features, such as the ability to link people worldwide based on shared interest, allow learners to engage in authentic cross-cultural interactions. This engagement is seen as essential for raising awareness of socio-pragmatic norms and practicing language use in authentic contexts.

N. Ishihara,2014.0,Is It Rude Language? Children Learning Pragmatics Through Visual Narratives,"There has been an upsurge of interest in teaching second/foreign language (L2) pragmatics in recent years, but much of this effort has been targeted at adult learners. This article introduces small-scale informal instruction exploring the pragmatic development of 9-year-olds in Tokyo, facilitated through dialogic in- tervention on pragmatics using the visual presentation of narratives. Although the instruction took place in an English as a foreign language (EFL) context, the same dialogic approach is relevant to ESL in Canada and elsewhere, as picture books enrich narratives, visually mediating the context of language use in a manner comprehensible and captivating to young learners. The learners’ pragmatic development was scaffolded dialogically through instructional materials doubling as teacher-based assessments, including formality judgment tasks, discourse completion tasks, and student-generated visual discourse completion tasks, assessed through predesigned rubrics and written reflections by the teacher. Video-recorded data showed that repeated visual assistance provided by the teacher and peers led to enhanced pragmatic awareness and metapragmatic judgments of the relative levels of formality and politeness of the target pragmatic formulas. However, with little L2 exposure, these learners were often unable to produce newly introduced expressions and failed to match the demands of the context with appropriate language choices during this isolated series of instructional events.",,10.18806/TESL.V30I7.1157,https://doi.org/10.18806/TESL.V30I7.1157,forward

"Ilka Floeck, Joanna Pfingsthorn",2016.0,Comparing Instrument-induced Effects in EFL Requests: Task-based Approach versus Discourse Completion Task,": In Interlanguage Pragmatics (ILP) research, the Discourse Completion Task (DCT) is the main source of insight into speakers’ productions of pragmatic phenomena. Its omnipresence as a means of data collection can be explained by the need of comparability of data sets and (sociolinguistic) variable control. However, some studies suggest a discrepancy between surface realisations observed in naturally occurring data and experimental data like DCTs (cf. e.g. Beebe and Cummings 1996; Golato 2003).Unfortunately, the results of these studies are inconclusive and do not offer any information about quantitative differences in realisation patterns and about the impact of different methodological approaches on interlanguage data. It is therefore the aim of the present study to compare the influence of two methods of data collection, DCTs and task-based elicited conversations, on the realisation of the head act strategies in requests produced by advanced learners of English. Overall, our results show a significant difference in the distributions of request head act strategies across the two methodological conditions. The conversational head acts are substantially more direct than the requests elicited by DCTs. The patterns observed in learner data strongly resemble the ones found in native speaker requests in the same methodological scenarios. This implies that despite earlier claims, advanced learners can display target-like language use. The resemblances furthermore indicate that semi-naturalistic methods of data collection are a more valid means to obtain learner data that is representative of naturally occurring conversations.",,10.19195/0301-7966.54.4,https://doi.org/10.19195/0301-7966.54.4,forward

Kanik Mehmet,2010.0,Interlanguage pragmatics in Turkish,"This study aims to investigate interlanguage pragmatics in Turkish. For this pur-pose, a discourse completion questionnaire including four request situations was given to 33 learners of Turkish at a university in Istanbul, Turkey as well as 45 Turkish native speakers in two different programs at the same institution. The data were then coded into request strategies. The length of requests and the number of strategies employed were also coded. The request strategies were analyzed using the chi-square test while the length and the number of strategies were analyzed using the independent samples t-test. Results indicate that the two groups differed in head act strategies and downgrader strategies only in situation 3 while they differed in situation 2 through 4 in using supportive moves. In the length of the requests, number of supportive moves and the number of downgraders, the groups differed in only one situation. This shows that although differences are observed, there is no drastic difference between native-Turkish speaking students and learners of Turkish as a second language. This shows that even after one academic year in the target speech community, learners tend to choose strategies similar to the native speakers of the target language. The effect of sojourn in the target community could be further researched by comparing learners of Turkish in the target speech community to those that learn Turkish outside of the target speech community after the same amount of time spent learning Turkish..",,10.1501/dilder_0000000137,https://doi.org/10.1501/dilder_0000000137,forward

The study employed an instructional experimental design over a 6-month period with 34 Chinese students assigned to either an explicitly instructed group or a control group receiving no instruction. Instruction took place prior to departure for the UK and performance was measured based on a pretest-posttest design using an oral computer-animated production test (CAPT). This paper explores the data in two specific ways. Firstly, the request data were analysed at the pre-and delayed test stages (six months into the study abroad period) to analyse the extent to which participants' reliance on L1 request strategies and language changes over time. Secondly, we measured the amount and type of contact with English which participants reported prior to and six months into the study abroad period. Results show that instruction facilitated development of pragmatically appropriate request language over time, with instructed learners showing significantly less reliance on L1 transfer than non-instructed learners. Contact with English increased significantly for both groups on all measures of language production but not all receptive contact with English. When compared, there was no significant difference between the groups' contact with English at each stage, suggesting that instruction did not result in significantly more interaction with English during the study abroad period.",,10.29140/ICE.V2N2.162,https://doi.org/10.29140/ICE.V2N2.162,forward

Bilal Ed-deraouy,2024.0,Evaluating Pragmatic Input in Moroccan EFL Contexts: Sociopragmatic and Pragmalinguistic Perspectives,"Pragmatic competence presents a multifaceted challenge, deeply rooted in linguistic and cultural factors. Within the Moroccan context, despite the increasing interest in the study of pragmatics, most research primarily documents speech acts without adequately considering the students' backgrounds or the received pragmatic input. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the pragmatic input of English speakers in Morocco. Employing a mixed-methods approach, it examines the pragmatic competence of 30 students, including both English majors and non-English majors from various schools in Morocco. A Google form questionnaire was utilized to assess both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic knowledge in relation to pragmatic input. The findings indicate a moderate overall awareness of pragmatics yet reveal significant deficiencies in sociopragmatic awareness, likely attributable to the reported deficiencies in pragmatic input. Notably, the study also shows that students are well aware of and exposed to authentic materials, especially through media, yet they do not focus on the pragmatic aspects of language in favor of other skills. These results underscore the necessity for curricular reforms that integrate pragmatic elements more holistically, particularly pragmatic instruction, thereby paving the way for future research to refine educational strategies and enhance pragmatic proficiency.",,10.32996/ijllt.2024.7.6.7,https://doi.org/10.32996/ijllt.2024.7.6.7,forward

The present study builds on the existing task complexity literature by examining the impact of task complexity and pragmatic situational demands on the number of learning opportunities for request-making expressions. Forty-nine Korean junior high school learners of English as a foreign language were randomly assigned to participate in either simple- or complex- collaborative pair writing tasks, which included different levels of pragmatic situational demands. The interactions were transcribed and analyzed for the frequency of pragmatic related episodes (PREs; Kim & Taguchi, 2015) as well as the number of turns within each PRE. The results showed that task complexity played an important role in facilitating PREs by targeting sociopragmatic factors and not pragmalinguistic forms, regardless of the level of pragmatic task demands. Results are discussed in light of promoting interaction-driven learning opportunities for pragmatics using collaborative tasks.",,10.1111/FLAN.12180,https://doi.org/10.1111/FLAN.12180,forward

The purpose of this study is to investigate the linguistic mitigating devices that deaf Jordanian adults use when making requests. To this end, a sample of 52 people (of whom 26 were hearing and 26 were deaf) was collected through a Discourse Completion Task (DCT). It was found that the two groups of participants showed variations in the way they structured their request acts and spelled them out. This was evident in the deaf group’s obvious underuse of certain request mitigation strategies and the lexico-grammatical items mapping them; in the absence of some strategies (i.e., sweetener, promise of reward, hint, and threat); and in the underassessment of social distance, relative power, and degree of imposition. This inappropriate use of requesting acts by deaf participants is attributed to their inadequate linguistic, pragma-linguistic and socio-pragmatic competence. The study concludes with some suggestions how to improve the Jordanian educational system for the deaf.",,10.1075/ps.20016.nah,https://doi.org/10.1075/ps.20016.nah,forward

S. García,2019.0,Teaching apologies through the use of audiovisual materials,"Since Austin’s (1962) classic work How To Do Things With Words there have been numerous studies about the way in which utterances are used as a mean to perform actions. The branch of linguistics that deals with this phenomenon is pragmatics, which emerged in the 1960s as a reaction to Chomsky’s idea that the importance of language lies in the correct use of grammar (MartinezFlor and Uso-Juan 2010). After the elaboration of several models of communicative competence presented by a number of authors such as Canale and Swain (1980), Bachman (1990), and Celce-Murcia (1995, 2007), the idea that pragmatic awareness is necessary in order for speakers to be successful in communication has spread, being one of the most relevant constructs the one introduced by CelceMurcia (2007). Research has been conducted especially on speech acts, such as Leech’s (2014) book The Pragmatics of Politeness, whose taxonomy will be used in this study, and on the use of audiovisual material for teaching purposes. For that reason, we have carried out an analysis on speech acts, and in particular on apologies, in the fiction TV series The Big Bang Theory. The aim of this study is to analyse whether apologies in the nine episodes examined mirror real-life conversations, and if so, to show that this audiovisual material may be used for classroom activities as an appropriate tool to develop students’ pragmatic knowledge.",,10.6035/forumrecerca.2018.23.22,https://doi.org/10.6035/forumrecerca.2018.23.22,forward

"Ariadna Sánchez-Hernández, J. Barón",2021.0,Teaching second language pragmatics in the current era of globalization: An introduction,"The increasing mobility of speakers of different languages to different countries, together with the globalized world we live in, have led to multilingual societies in which linguistic exchanges between both native and non-native speakers have become a very common practice. This reality emphasizes the need to help learners of foreign and second languages become not only linguistically competent but also pragmatically competent, in order not to sound impolite or inappropriate in the target language. Addressing this need, studies in interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) have explored which methodology is most effective for teaching pragmatics. Earlier ILP studies compared explicit versus implicit instruction, highlighting the key role of explicit metapragmatic explanations. More recently, scholars have investigated how to create opportunities to for authentic pragmatic practice inside the classroom. To do so, some studies have implemented task-based language teaching to provide students with goal-oriented meaningful activities that address their real-world needs. Other studies have incorporated technology-enhanced materials such as simulated immersive environments and computer-mediated communication to promote students’ engagement in authentic use of the language beyond the classroom. Another current concern in L2 pragmatic instruction is how to account for the emergence of English as an International Language (EIL), and the consequent need to guide learners into acquiring language as a tool to mediate across linguistic and cultural boundaries. Different studies have adopted an EIL perspective, proposing the enhancement of students’ metapragmatic awareness and strategies to deal with the hybrid nature of English and its associated varieties and cultures. The special issue ‘Teaching second language pragmatics in the current era of globalization’ aims to illustrate such current trends, with six contributions by distinguished scholars in the field of L2 pragmatics from all over the globe.",,10.1177/13621688211064931,https://doi.org/10.1177/13621688211064931,forward

During the treatment, the students were exposed to target formulas from four interaction contexts. A qualitative utterance analysis was conducted to determine how pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic abilities of the students evolved after the teaching intervention. Additionally, three expert judges evaluated students’ pragmatic performance. The results indicate that improvements in both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic abilities of the students were associated with the use of target-like formulas in their speech acts.",,10.55593/ej.27105a2,https://doi.org/10.55593/ej.27105a2,forward

The theme of the conference was Integrating informal learning into formal language education. 
 
As contact time with students is increasingly reduced in higher education, teachers are looking at ways to support their students with resources that can be used outside the classroom. This means that many teachers are looking at approaches such as flipping the classroom or initiatives like the use of social media to access resources or interact with peers or native speakers, telecollaboration activities between learners in different countries, or the co-creation of learning artefacts such as videos, websites, or texts. The incorporation of such activities into the curriculum blurs the boundaries between formal and informal activity. 
 
The chapters in this book provide insights into many types of these innovative approaches to teaching languages at university and beyond. The contributing authors have experimented with new strategies to enrich their students’ learning experience or identified new ways of using existing resources in and outside the classroom.",,10.14705/RPNET.2018.22.9782490057108,https://doi.org/10.14705/RPNET.2018.22.9782490057108,forward

"Joseph Siegel, James Broadbridge",2018.0,Message sent. Message-received? Teachers and target community members decide,"ABSTRACT The linguistic, social, and intercultural benefits of overseas experiences for English as a foreign language (EFL) learners continue to gain attention as the significance of English as a lingua franca proliferates. As the use of English for international communication increases, it is important to examine such interactions from multiple viewpoints. While previous studies have investigated various aspects of study abroad for EFL learners, the perspectives of target community members (TCMs) have often been overlooked. Therefore, this study investigated differences in EFL teacher and nonteacher TCM perceptions of five Japanese university study abroad students’ spoken pragmatic output. Students completed 10 oral discourse completion tasks before and after their one-semester study abroad. The EFL teacher and nonteacher TCM groups watched videos of and rated each task for formality and appropriateness. Findings showed the two groups perceived gains related to student speech and development. However, teachers rated on the pre-departure tasks lower but the post-tasks higher, while the TCMs did not identify as much improvement. Implications for students, teachers, and receiving communities are discussed.",,10.1080/17501229.2016.1143475,https://doi.org/10.1080/17501229.2016.1143475,forward

Naoko Taguchi,2018.0,4. Pragmatic competence in foreign language education: Cultivating learner autonomy and strategic learning of pragmatics,"Three decades after the emergence of communicative competence models (e.g. Canale & Swain, 1980), pragmatic competence has established a recognition that learning a language extends beyond grammar. However, language curriculums and instructional materials are seldom pragmatics-focused. Although grammar appears systematically in course syllabi, pragmatics is usually addressed randomly as questions arise, often in conjunction with culture topics. Lack of the systematic appearance of pragmatic features, along with limited range of communicative situations and functions in classroom discourse and textbooks, has led to a general concern that classroom learning is poor in opportunities for pragmatic development (Bardovi-Harlig, 2001). To address this concern, this paper discusses autonomous learning and strategy training as a model of pragmatics pedagogy. Based on the data collected from Japanese ESL students in an immersion setting (Taguchi, 2012), I will illustrate a case of a strategic learner who cultivated a variety of self-directed resources for pragmatics learning, which led to a strong development of pragmatic competence. Based on this case study and drawing on the recent model of strategic self-regulation (Oxford, 2011), I will present the taxonomy of strategy instruction as a way of promoting autonomous learning of pragmatics. Strategy training can be an alternative form of formal instruction, assisting learners to take initiative in learning pragmatics from everyday, non-pragmatics-focused materials.",,10.1515/9781501505034-004,https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501505034-004,forward
"Amatur Rahman, Serajum Munira",2024.0,The Speech Acts of the Language of Teachers' Criticism in EAP Classes: A Pragmatic Analysis,"Exploring speech acts within the realm of language instruction has consistently been a captivating subject. Limited research has delved into the analysis of speech acts employed by English teachers for criticism during classroom interactions. This study primarily aims to identify the classifications of speech acts used most frequently by teachers in English for Academic Purpose (EAP) courses for criticism. Additionally, it examines the rationale behind selecting a particular type of speech act for criticism by EAP course instructors and assesses how this classification of speech acts may influence teaching strategies and student performance. The research employed classroom observations and interviews for data collection, utilizing purposive sampling to select five teachers and forty students from the English department's EAP 009 course. Observational guidelines and situational questionnaires served as research instruments. Qualitative thematic analysis and data coding were applied for data analysis. Classroom observations indicated that EAP teachers predominantly used directive criticism, with a comparatively low utilization of commissive criticism, aligning with the principles of communicative language teaching. Conversely, teacher interviews unveiled that, while direct criticism was prevalent, declarative criticism was also employed. This suggests a need for greater consistency in teachers' selection of specific criticisms, minimizing potential impacts on teaching strategies. The study recommends that EAP teachers diversify their criticism approaches based on student needs and contextual factors.",,10.70771/jocw.v8i1.70,https://doi.org/10.70771/jocw.v8i1.70,forward

Furthermore, the study set out to investigate the possible relations between the level of the textbooks and the frequency of pragmatic components being included. To this end, 172 conversations of the aforementioned textbooks were thoroughly analyzed to determine the frequency of the PMs based on House and Kasper (1981) taxonomy, the frequency of SAs based on Searle's (1979) paradigm, and the frequency of LFs according to Halliday’s (1978) framework. Findings revealed that Committers were the most frequently-used PMs, Representatives and Directives were the most commonly-used SAs, and Informatives enjoyed the highest frequency among LFs. The results also indicated that these pragmatic components were not equally distributed throughout the conversations and no significant relationship existed between level of the textbooks and frequency of the pragmatic elements. In addition to the consciousness-raising dimension of the study, material developers might be able to appropriately represent and include pragmatic information into their materials.

The current paucity of knowledge regarding the developmental aspect of L2 pragmatic competence has led to calls for detailed longitudinal interlanguage pragmatic studies (cf.

"Assiye Burgucu-Tazegul, Turgay Han, A.

These are potential problems for most English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL)/English-as-a-second-language (ESL) learners. Therefore, it is the aim of this study to investigate the issue in Turkish EFL context (i.e. the English request emails of Turkish EFL university students to their non-native professors). Specifically, the extent of directness used and the extent and nature of lexical modification employed by Turkish EFL students to mitigate their requests were examined by using authentic data. The data is a part of natural e-mail corpus of 34 Turkish EFL students’ e-mail requests to their two non-native foreign professors over a period of 2 months at English-medium University in Turkey. First, the corpus was coded via coding schemes, (see Appendices A and C) and ranked with a rubric (Appendix B). The results indicated that the Turkish EFL students’ e-mails involved a) direct strategies rather than conventional indirect strategies, b) overusing direct questions and ‘want’ statements, c) underused query preparatory questions, d) insufficient mitigation causing directness and impoliteness, and e) inappropriate greetings and closing statements affecting degree of direction. It is implicated that e-mail instruction (to recipient in various degrees) should be included in EFL books and curricula.",,10.5539/IES.V9N10P105,https://doi.org/10.5539/IES.V9N10P105,forward

Given this premise, the current study aimed to examine effects of classroom praxis-based instruction adjusted to EFL learners’ Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) on their comprehension of CIMs. Participants were 36 Iranian high school students in 2 classrooms, assigned to experimental and comparison groups. A 20-item CIM test was administered at pretest and posttest times to collect the data. Microgenetic trajectories were also traced through audio-recorded role-plays and social interactions within the ZPD setting. ZPD-adjusted mediational instruction on CIMs was given based on a multi-level regulatory scale and a view of microgenetic development along an other-to self-regulated functioning continuum. In the non-ZPD setting, mainstream teacher-fronted instruction was employed. ANCOVA results revealed differential instructional effects in favor of the praxis-based mediational setting. Microgenetic learning episodes also portrayed how collectively-mediated, ZPD-activated learning led to L2 learners’ progressively improved comprehension of CIMs. The findings suggest that comprehension (and perhaps production) of L2 CIMs can be improved through praxis-oriented co-construction of pragmatic knowledge through collaborative engagement with communicative activity.",,10.1515/lpp-2021-0007,https://doi.org/10.1515/lpp-2021-0007,forward

The speech act of apology has received great attention in interlanguage pragmatic studies due to its frequent use in spoken communication and its pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic variations across languages and cultures. This study aimed to determine what strategies are used by EFL learners in the Iranian context to produce the speech act of apology. Data for the study were elicited through a written discourse completion task from two groups of lower- and higher-proficiency learners studying English at a language center. Consistent with many previous findings, the results revealed that when apologizing all participants considerably preferred “direct apology strategy” to other strategies. By contrast, the indirect strategies of “offering promise of forbearance” and “expressing concern for the hearer” were used the least frequently. The findings did not substantiate any meaningful effect on the appropriateness of EFL learners’ apologies in terms of their proficiency. This study suggests that (1) there is a gap between L2 learners' linguistic development and their pragmatic development, (2) incidental exposure to speech acts is not sufficient for pragmatic development, and (3) there is a need to increase EFL learners' pragmatic awareness.",,10.22132/TEL.2012.54905,https://doi.org/10.22132/TEL.2012.54905,forward

Data were collected from three learner groups (American learners of Spanish) (45 learners [15 per group: beginning, intermediate, advanced]). Open role plays were used to collect data in four request situations. Data were analyzed for request head acts (direct, conventional indirect, non-conventional indirect), the request perspective, and internal and external modification. Findings indicate that the beginner group produced the largest number of direct requests. They, thus, showed little competence in situational variation. These direct requests were often realized by means of verbless requests, statements of need, imperatives, and requests with an infinitive used as a main verb. In contrast, a strong preference for conventionally indirect requests was observed among intermediate and advanced learners in formal and informal situations, with a decline in direct requests noted to appear with increasing proficiency. Four stages of pragmatic development among learners in a FL context were identified and discussed in light of existing research in pragmatic development. This study also addresses the issue of the primacy of pragmatics over grammar in expressing pragmatic intent, formula research in interlanguage pragmatics, and pragmatic development in the FL classroom.",,10.1515/IP.2007.013,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP.2007.013,forward

The selected studies document Chinese researchers' efforts to improve the teaching and learning of the Chinese language in terms of language pedagogy, language learning and teacher development. We contend that these studies on the teaching and learning of Chinese as a second or foreign language (CSL/CFL) can contribute to the advancement of second/foreign language education theories even though they were largely conducted to address local needs and interests in the Chinese context. Unfortunately, the impact of these studies on international language education research and pedagogical development remains limited and peripheral.

Israa A Qari,2021.0,"The Effect of Explicit Instruction of Requests on Saudi EFL learners using a pre-test, post-test Approach","The aim of the current study is to test whether explicit instruction of various L2 request forms can be a useful measure in developing Saudi learners’ linguistic and pragmatic competences. This study is based on the results obtained from a previous research investigating interlanguage requests. The findings in that study suggested that the second language learners were not aware of some of the request strategies which were exclusively employed by the British English native speakers. The aim and the question of this study is to find out whether explicit instruction of request strategies will be effective in helping Saudi EFL learners gain linguistic knowledge and achieve pragmatic appropriateness in making requests in L2. Thirty female foundation year students participated in this study. They were all EFL learners studying at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The group underwent three phases of instruction: pre-test, instruction/intervention, and post-test. The first and last phases consisted of written questionnaires which were distributed right before and after the instruction phase. The results showed that in the third phase, the students demonstrated great progress in their understanding of request forms in L2. Their improvement was manifested by the learners’ acknowledgement of these forms as proper employment of request strategies in English, recognition of request function names, ability to assign correct functions to linguistic realizations and their overall understanding of the appropriate use of these forms dictated by the weightiness of different request situations.",,10.24093/AWEJ/VOL12NO1.8,https://doi.org/10.24093/AWEJ/VOL12NO1.8,forward

 In this paper, we examine uses of ‘don’t worry’ by Chinese speakers of English, which may trigger intercultural irritations. We investigate such problematic uses from a contrastive angle, by considering whether they relate to the fact that in Chinese there are two expressions which may be equivalents of English ‘don’t worry’: fangxin 放心 (lit. ‘ease your heart’) and bie-danxin 别担心 (lit. ‘don’t burden your heart’). First, we present uses of ‘don’t worry’ by Chinese learners of English and examine them through the lens of speech acts and interaction. Second, we undertake a corpus-based study of the speech act-indicating interactional uses of ‘don’t worry’, fangxin and bie-danxin, teasing out their conventional uses. Finally, we consider whether uses of ‘don’t worry’ by Chinese learners of English are influenced by pragmatic transfer and, if so, what this transfer looks like.",,10.1093/applin/amae020,https://doi.org/10.1093/applin/amae020,forward

The sample of the study was 42 students from the English language department at Cihan University-Duhok, Iraq. The experiment lasted one academic semester. The participants’ English language proficiency, as determined by an IELTS test sample, was intermediate, and then they were randomly split into two groups, namely experimental and control. Before and after the treatment, a Written Discourse Completion Test (WDCT) served as a pre-and post-test given to the two groups to assess statistically significant differences between them. The experimental group received direct instruction on request and suggestion speech acts via the presentation of the carefully chosen movie and TV series clips. In contrast, the control group was exposed to a minimal amount of pragmatics through printed texts. The findings demonstrated that the experimental group outperformed the control group. More precisely, the findings revealed that movie and TV series clips had a significant influence on learners’ production of requests and suggestions. Considering the above findings, the researchers propose EFL teachers apply movie and TV series clips to improve their Students’ pragmatic competence in class.",,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.974757,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.974757,forward

The present study examines whether giving corrective feedback on students’ performance during pragmatics-focused activities leads to their subsequent improvement in producing and recognising pragmatically appropriate email requests in the above context. Two intact classes of Vietnamese EFL (English as a foreign language) intermediate level students were randomly assigned to either direct-feedback condition or meta-pragmatic feedback condition, but received similar explicit pragmatic pre-instruction. Another intact class was randomly selected as a control group. Students’ pragmatic performance was measured by means of a pre-test, an immediate and delayed post-tests, which consisted of a production and a recognition task. The results indicate that the treatment groups performed significantly better than the control group in the production task, but there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. On the other hand, students who received meta-pragmatic feedback significantly outperformed those receiving direct feedback and the control group in the recognition task.

Stephanie W. Cheng,2005.0,An exploratory cross-sectional study of interlanguage pragmatic development of expressions of gratitude by Chinese learners of English,"The present study is an exploratory cross-sectional study of interlanguage pragmatic development of expressions of gratitude, specifically, gratitude after receiving a favor. Expressing gratitude is a speech act that is taught at an early age and is commonly performed by native speakers of most languages. It is, thus, often assumed that learners can successfully say thank you in the target language. However, studies show that even advanced learners have difficulty adequately expressing gratitude. The objectives of the present study are: (a) to investigate how native speakers of Chinese and native speakers of English express gratitude as defined by length of speech and use of strategies; (b) to examine whether there is evidence of pragmatic development in the speech act behavior of expressions of gratitude among Chinese learners of English with the increase of the length of residence in the United States; and (c) to examine whether there is evidence of pragmatic influence from L1 Chinese in English expressions of gratitude among Chinese learners of English. The data were collected through a discourse completion task questionnaire. Subjects’ responses were classified into eight thanking strategies. Descriptive and t-test analyses were conducted to identify the pragmatic differences that distinguished the behavior of the three English learner groups, which varied according to their length of stay in the United States, from that of Chinese and English native speakers. The results show that Chinese and English native speakers have different preferences for thanking strategies in the eight situations. They are significantly different in the length of speech and use of strategies. In addition, there is a positive effect of the length of residence in the United States on English learners’ pragmatic development. The results also show evidence of pragmatic influence from L1 Chinese. Moreover, contextual variables, social status, familiarity and imposition, have a significant influence on the length of speech and the use of strategies for all subject groups.",,10.17077/ETD.5MJL4I0Y,https://doi.org/10.17077/ETD.5MJL4I0Y,forward

Thirty non-native respondents were from working contexts and 31 from tertiary education institutes, and 15 native speakers were drawn from a university context. Analysis revealed no working context effect on understanding of implicature items but substantial L2 proficiency effect, and some length of residence effect on pragmatic knowledge of implicature.

The most common approach taken in studies on instruction is to focus on a speech act and to develop a lesson that acts as a separate unit for the learners (or study participants). The current article presents a slightly different approach, suggesting that language educators enhance grammar lessons that are already part of the curriculum with instruction on pragmatics. Instead of developing additional units, this article shows how grammar lessons can be extended and enhanced using internet searches on Google and YouTube to find authentic materials in addition to authentic written texts. These lessons, in addition to providing metapragmatic instruction, also present opportunities to make cross-cultural comparisons between different Spanish-speaking countries and the United States.",,10.1353/HPN.2012.0129,https://doi.org/10.1353/HPN.2012.0129,forward

Due to its presence in the learning of a second language, transfer has been tackled from a wide range of perspectives along the last fifty years, but its pragmatic dimension has been recognized recently, encouraging nowadays the development of this field. This article aims to describe the process of transfer by covering the research about it, from the first studies taking this element into account through the later ones, that include the analysis of pragmatic transfer. We now revise the main literature as regards linguistic and pragmatic transfer in the Englishspeaking tradition as well as in Spain. Specifically, we approach the role of transfer in the learning of a L2, focusing on the arrival of Pragmatics to the teaching of foreign languages in general and to the studies about transfer in SLA in particular.

"Bokyung Mun, Sinae Lee",2023.0,Teaching Secondary Meaning in Korean -ess-eya ha- Constructions,"
 This article investigates the degree to which second language (L2) learners whose first language (L1) is English access the nonactualization inference that arises at the semantic-pragmatic interface in Korean. As in English, when the modal -eya ha- “should, must” interacts with the past tense, a secondary interpretation that the complement does not hold becomes salient. The results from 12 native speakers of Korean and 16 L2 learners of varying study durations suggested that L2 learners do not compute the secondary inferences in the same way native speakers do, regardless of their study duration. A survey of textbooks frequently adopted in Korean teaching programs across the United States and in South Korea suggests that this nonactualization inference resulting from the interaction of modal and tense is not included as part of the lessons across different levels. The current study argues that this inference should be taught explicitly as part of the language program for the learners, given the frequency of this structure. The study also proposes how and when such secondary meaning should be introduced in language classrooms.",,10.5325/korelangamer.27.1.0001,https://doi.org/10.5325/korelangamer.27.1.0001,forward

With the assumption that learners in both settings are driven by their L1 speech norms (L1 interference), the researcher tried to explain learners’ English language performance both pragmalinguistically, in regards to the level of indirectness and types of modification, and sociopragmatically, in regards to the impact of social parameters (status, distance and degree of imposition) on the level of indirectness and amount of modification. Since English and Arabic are distinct linguistically and culturally, the researcher tried to explain the extent of such influence with reference to language learning in both settings. The study was carried out at Al-Quds Open University (QOU) and the Arab American University (AAUJ) in Palestine. Discourse completion task (DCT) was used to collect relevant data, which were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings suggested that while QOU learners approximate L1 requesting norms pragmalinguistically and socipragmaically, AAUJ learners tend to play it safe through preference for norms that are less face threatening and more conforming to the English language traditions. The differences between the request performance of both groups of L2 learners could be attributed to the different methods of instruction and language learning policies at both universities. The study recommends a greater emphasis on face-toface meetings and the application of more interactive media for teaching and learning English as a foreign language in the open education settings.",,10.12816/0020262,https://doi.org/10.12816/0020262,forward

The development of students’ sociolinguistic competence not on ly relies on their interaction with other language users, but also their interaction with materials and resources that include aspects of sociolinguistic competence. ESL instructors need to not only choose appropriate teaching resources for the development of students’ sociolinguistic competence, but also utilise them effectively in the language classroom. This study explores how ESL instructors utilise teaching resources for the development of students’ sociolinguistic competence in the language classroom. In-depth interviews and stimulated recalls were employed in gathering data from three chosen ESL instructors from one institution. The findings reveal that these ESL instructors used alternative teaching resources to manage the lack of available resources and considered students’ needs when utilising the teaching resources in the classroom. Based on the findings, it could be concluded that ESL instructors not only need to adapt and improvise their lessons to utilise teaching resources which are suitable fo r second language learners, but also cater to their students’ needs to motivate them for further development of their sociolinguistic competence outside the language classroom. ESL instructors can use the findings from this study as a guide for the development of their students’ sociolinguistic competence through the use of teaching resources, and further research could be done on this topic, specifically focusing on the development of teaching resources emphasising on sociolinguistic competence.",,10.6007/ijarbss/v12-i5/13217,https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v12-i5/13217,forward

 This study explored the relationship between metapragmatic knowledge and transfer of learning from one speech act to another.

Immediately after the instruction, they reported what they thought they learned or noticed during the instruction, which served as an indication of their metapragmatic knowledge. After this, they completed immediate and delayed post-tests that assessed their knowledge of the instructed speech act (request-making) as well as their knowledge of the uninstructed speech act, advice-giving (transfer item). Results showed that the participants made significant gains in their productive knowledge of both speech acts after the instruction. The participants’ metapragmatic knowledge significantly correlated with their test performance for both speech acts. These findings indicate that transfer of learning from one speech act to another can occur after instruction. The findings also support that metapragmatic knowledge established during instruction is related to the transfer.",,10.1093/applin/amac043,https://doi.org/10.1093/applin/amac043,forward

Four UK-based learners of Korean with competence levels ranging from Novice High through Intermediate High participated in the study, contributing transcripts of CMC interactions and participating in retrospective interviews over a three-month period. Qualitative analysis of the data shows that CMC provided a fertile context for these learners to manifest pragmatic competence in the use of address terms and to progress beyond classroom learning. Address terms also worked as powerful tools for these learners to establish intimate relationships with Korean acquaintances and negotiate identities as legitimate speakers of the language. However, this process of identity negotiation was complicated by gaps in their pragmatic competence, their preexisting identities and differing expectations on the part of Korean interlocutors. Ultimately, the analysis shows that the question of what constitutes “appropriate” use of address terms in CMC interactions involving L2 learners of Korean is unstable and open to negotiation. The implications of this finding for future research and for KSL (Korean as a Second Language) teaching methodologies are addressed in the conclusion.",,10.11139/CJ.31.3.264-284,https://doi.org/10.11139/CJ.31.3.264-284,forward

"S. Hosseini, M.

To this end, 80 English-major university students formed four intact experimental groups: two literary and two nonliterary groups. One of the literary groups (Implicit Play) received typographically enhanced plays containing the speech acts of apology, request, and refusal, and the other (Explicit Play) received the same plus metapragmatic instruction on the speech acts. The medium of instruction for the nonliterary groups were dialogs containing the given functions; they were also given either enhanced input (Implicit Dialog) or input plus metapragmatic information (Explicit Dialog). All the groups took a written discourse completion test (WDCT) and a multiple-choice discourse completion test (MDCT) before and after instruction. Analysis of the groups’ performance on the WDCT pretest and posttest did not show an advantage for the literary medium, that is, there was no significant difference between literary and nonliterary groups. It was rather the mode of instruction that mattered most; explicit groups outperformed their implicit counterparts. As for the groups’ performance on the MDCT pre and posttest, analyses revealed that the groups had improved, but there was no significant difference among the groups as a result of the four teaching conditions, suggesting that pragmatic instruction regardless of the medium and mode of teaching can improve learners’ knowledge of speech acts.",,10.18823/ASIATEFL.2018.15.4.12.1065,https://doi.org/10.18823/ASIATEFL.2018.15.4.12.1065,forward

K. Bardovi-Harlig,2012.0,"Formulas, Routines, and Conventional Expressions in Pragmatics Research","This article reviews the recent research on formulaic language in pragmatics from three perspectives: foundational issues, recurrent research questions, and the populations studied. Examination of foundational issues, including definitions and operationalization of the concept of formula in pragmatics, shows the way in which pragmatics understands formulaic language and what it contributes to the study of formulaic language, namely, a strong sense of social contract. Recurrent themes in contemporary investigations include how formulas are used in general and in specific contexts, determining how extensive the use of formulas is, attitudes toward formulas, acquisition of formulas in second language (L2) pragmatics, and formulas in pragmatics pedagogy. The third section reviews pragmatic research according to language community, defined for the purposes of this review as first language (L1; native-speaker communities), L2, cross-cultural comparisons, indigenized varieties, and lingua franca communities. The investigation of formula use by different communities addresses questions of the particular and the universal in formula use and the importance of community and community membership.",,10.1017/S0267190512000086,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190512000086,forward

The effects of task type and L2 proficiency on discourse appropriacy in oral task performance,"Conceived within the TBLT framework, the present study examined pedagogic tasks as vehicles for demonstrating L2 learners’ discourse appropriacy in oral production. Eighty ESL learners’ discourse appropriacy was measured using three pragmatically-oriented task types (complaint, refusal, and advice) across four different proficiency levels. The findings showed that, for all task types, as general proficiency increased, ratings of discourse appropriacy also increased. We found that there was a pronounced difference in discourse appropriacy between the intermediate and advanced proficiency levels, and that for learners at higher levels of proficiency, discourse appropriacy did not vary from task to task. In contrast, task type made a difference for less proficient learners in that the refusal task was particularly challenging compared with other tasks.",,10.1075/TBLT.10.10EKI,https://doi.org/10.1075/TBLT.10.10EKI,forward

"A. Mirzaei, A. Roohani, Maryam Esmaeili",2012.0,Exploring Pragmalinguistic and Sociopragmatic Variability in Speech Act Production of L2 Learners and Native Speakers,"The pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic aspects of language use vary across different situations, languages, and cultures. The separation of these two facets of language use can help to map out the socio-cultural norms and conventions as well as the linguistic forms and strategies that underlie the pragmatic performance of different language speakers in a variety of target language use situations. This study explored the sociopragmatic and pragmalinguistic variations in the expression and realization of three speech acts of apology, request, and refusal by American native speakers and Iranian EFL learners. The participants were 100 graduate and undergraduate Iranian students and 50 American native speakers. A written discourse completion test (WDCT) was developed through a bottom-up procedure and used for collecting the data. The results showed that considerable variations emerged in the semantic formulae, sociopragmatic content, and pragmalinguistic forms the participants employed in realizing the speech acts in relation to the contextual variables and individual differences. The American participants employed more (pragmalinguistic) formulaic strategies and were generally more direct than the Iranian L2 learners. Further variability was also noticeable in the participants’ choice of sociopragmatic appropriacy formulae in order to mitigate their speech acts and avoid offending their interlocutors. The findings indicated that there is an intricate reciprocity between the sociopragmatic values and the variant forms or strategies that language users employ on the pragmalinguistic level of language use. It is then suggested that pragmatic variation be traced and probed on the two pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic planes of language use in real-life (or simulated) contexts.",,10.22099/JTLS.2012.622,https://doi.org/10.22099/JTLS.2012.622,forward

Liam Wilson,2023.0,Investigating the coverage of speech acts in Hong Kong ELT textbooks,"In this investigation, speech acts targeted for instruction in ELT (English Language Teaching) textbooks commonly used in Hong Kong were examined using relational content analysis. The aim was to discover which speech acts are frequently presented or not evident, so that this information could be compared to that which has been found in prior studies in other locations. This is important because, from a pedagogical viewpoint, teachers need to ensure textbooks help students learn to use as wide a range of speech acts as possible. As textbooks also need to provide clear examples and information to help learners understand how and when to use speech acts, in this research, the presentation of the speech acts was examined to identify the pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic information. It was found that there was a tendency to include certain speech acts much more frequently than others, and that some were not included at all. There was also a general lack of clear pragmalinguistic (such as the presentation of indirect speech acts) and sociopragmatic information (such as dealing with high degrees of social distance) presented. This suggests that these factors could be given further consideration and that there are improvements that could be made to both the way that textbooks are written and selected for use. Therefore, this study contributes valuable information about the speech acts in Hong Kong ELT textbooks to and has important implications for both textbook writers and English teachers regarding the field of pragmatics.",,10.56040/lmdw2014,https://doi.org/10.56040/lmdw2014,forward

It has been found that the subjects preferred to use interrogatives, politeness devices, past tenses, grounders, and checking on availability more than the others. They did not use negations and downtoners in Arabic and used embedded if-clauses, consultative devices, and hedges sparsely. It also revealed other culture-specific types that did not appear in the Cross-Cultural Speech Acts Realization Project (CCSARP)i.e. alternatives, religious appealing markers, and other types of speech acts.

Face as the social identities and qualities speakers want to have upheld is seen to be associated with frames, i.e. the way speakers frame and interpret an event. Comparing three examples from a cross sectional dataset of discussions on issues surrounding university life, the paper shows that, in each of these cases, speakers applied different frames to the task, resulting in different patterns of turn-taking and modalization. These differences can be explained with the varying degrees of exposure to the target language in classroom and out-of-classroom situations as well as the educational environment in which the data were collected. The paper ends with a number of proposals for research in the field of interlanguage pragmatics, suggesting that politeness and speech act perspectives are insufficient to grasp learners’ real pragmatic intent. Instead, the question of how tasks and situations are interpreted by learners needs to be at the forefront of inquiry, with methods for data collection and analysis aligned properly.",,10.1558/JAPL.V4I3.285,https://doi.org/10.1558/JAPL.V4I3.285,forward

Determining what kind of intervention is most effectual for facilitating learners’ pragmatic development has been a central issue for researchers. To respond to the inconclusive findings in intervention studies and to extend the instructional studies in L2 pragmatics to less studied and more complex teaching targets, such as implicatures, the current study inquired into the effects of metapragmatic awareness, interactive translation, and discussion through video  vignettes on the comprehension of implicatures of 51 (15 male and 36 female) Iranian upper-intermediate EFL learners, who were selected based on Oxford Quick Placement Test (2004) from students majoring English Literature and TEFL at Golestan University, Gorgan, Iran. Fifty-six video prompts containing implicatures from Friends sitcom series and Desperate Housewives TV series were taught to the participants who were randomly assigned to four groups (metapragmatic awareness, interactive translation, discussion, and control). The participants attended the classes twice a week for eight sessions. Results of multiple-choice implicature listening test revealed that all three intervention groups outperformed the control group. Results of Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test illustrated that the metapragmatic awareness group outperformed the interactive translation and discussion groups. No meaningful difference was found between the interactive translation group and the discussion group. The paper concludes that providing learners with contextually appropriate input through video using methods of pragmatic instruction (metapragmatic consciousness-raising, translation, and discussion) is effective to promote their ability to comprehend implicatures and signposts some avenues for future research.",,10.22108/ARE.2019.118062.1476,https://doi.org/10.22108/ARE.2019.118062.1476,forward

A brief review of laboratory studies assessing the effects of recasts is then presented before we focus on classroom studies assessing the effects of different types of CF. Many variables mediate CF effectiveness: of these, we discuss linguistic targets and learners' age in terms of both previous and prospective research.

Also highlighted are recent developments in instruction as they pertain specifically to the teaching of L2 speaking, listening, reading, and writing. In the past 15 years or so, several crucial factors have combined to affect current perspectives on the teaching of English worldwide: (a) the decline of methods, (b) a growing emphasis on both bottom-up and top-down skills, (c) the creation of new knowledge about English, and (d) integrated and contextualized teaching of multiple language skills. In part because of its comparatively short history as a discipline, TESOL has been and continues to be a dynamic field, one in which new venues and perspectives are still unfolding. The growth of new knowledge about the how and the what of L2 teaching and learning is certain to continue and will probably remain the hallmark of TESOL’s disciplinary maturation.",,10.2307/40264513,https://doi.org/10.2307/40264513,forward

Fifty-two Iranian English students took part in this research project. First, the two questionnaires (i.e. ideal L2 self and ought-to L2 self) adopted from Dornyei and Taguchi (2010) were distributed among the participants. Moreover, the participants went through a six-week instructional period and received pragmatic instruction at the end of their regular class hour for thirty minutes. Finally, all the participants were required to complete two discourse completion tests containing eight scenarios borrowed from both Schauer’s (2009), and Jalilifar’s (2009) as pretest and posttest. This would enable the researchers to assess the participants’ pre- and post-instructional pragmatic knowledge. Descriptive statistics and independent samples t-tests were run to analyze the data. The findings indicate that high ideal L2 self group significantly outperformed the high ought-to L2 self group with regard to their pragmatic performances on discourse completion tests. The study further implies that factors such as the individuals’ ideal L2 self can be regarded as determining and pivotal when it comes to the amount of learning that takes place in learners with either high ideal L2 self or those with high ought-to L2 self.",,10.22051/LGHOR.2020.28265.1188,https://doi.org/10.22051/LGHOR.2020.28265.1188,forward

Even though there is strong evidence in ILP research that purports that L2 learners respond well to pragmatic instruction (Taguchi, 2015), the teaching of L2 pragmatics is not always prioritized in textbooks, teaching programmes or teacher education (Barron, 2016; Savvidou & Economidou-Kogetsidis, 2019) with the consequence that pragmatic learning can only occur incidentally. The present study examines opportunities to acquire L2 requests for 308 English as a foreign language (EFL) learners across 7 years of instruction in French secondary schools, investigating textbooks preferred by teachers, classroom interaction (39 hours), and teacher perspectives (semi-structured interviews with 10 teachers). After a pragmatic analysis of 15 EFL textbooks with a focus on requests, the study examines the incidence of metapragmatic input in 39 hours of teaching in 13 classes at 3 levels, and relates interactional patterns with interview data from the 10 teachers concerned. Findings suggest limited pragmatic input in both textbooks and classroom interaction. By comparing the profiles of teachers who encouraged L2 requests with those who did not, the study offers new explanations for L2 learners’ limited pragmatic development which also broadly corroborate previous findings of somewhat limited potential for L2 pragmatic development in obligatory school contexts.",,10.1177/13621688211064932,https://doi.org/10.1177/13621688211064932,forward
Fauzul Aufa,2011.0,The Use of Discourse Completion Task (DCT) As Explicit Instruction On Indonesian Efl Learners' Production of Suggestion Acts,"There are some activities that can be developed to bring up EFL learners' pragmatic awareness, such as contextualized language practice in given situations, constructed peer dialogues, and metapragmatic discussions. This task-based approach used in these activities can be either explicit or implicit instruction. One of them is a metapragmatic discussion prompted by Discourse Completion Task (DCT). In this paper, DCT, as an explicit pragmatic instruction, was practically investigated its effectiveness to facilitate EFL learners in developing their pragmatic competence. The results demonstrated from the analysis of RP2 prompted by the DCT support the fact that the explicit instruction results in some variations of linguistic forms that contribute to the development of subjects' pragmatic competence Key words : Discourse Completion Task (DCT), pragmatic competence, explicit pragmatic instruction, English as a Foreign Language (EFL).  ",,10.20885/jee.vol5.iss2.art2,https://doi.org/10.20885/jee.vol5.iss2.art2,forward

This generates studies on teaching implicature comprehension, most of which are lacking in qualitative probes into how attributable the ensuing performance changes are to the instructional materials and procedures themselves. Nevertheless, effective assessment of pedagogical interventions/innovations would require experimental studies to be adopted along with qualitative research for in-depth understanding from participants’ perspective. In this regard, through semi-structured retrospective interviews, the current study investigated how far and in what ways the performance changes after a project on teaching implicatures via film could be ascribed to the treatment itself. The content analysis results indicate that the performance changes originated mainly from the instruction and illuminate the share of the filmic materials as the innovative component there. On account of these, with its epistemological approach enabling triangulation, the study contributes to instructional pragmatics by providing an exemplary practice of quality assurance in teaching implicature comprehension/interpretation.",,10.29333/AJQR/10973,https://doi.org/10.29333/AJQR/10973,forward

Marta Kaliska,2016.0,An Action-Oriented Approach to Language Corpora in Foreign Language Teaching,"Since the advent of communicative approach which focuses primarily on real-life communication acts, presenting new vocabulary and grammar structures within a given context or theme, language teaching has undergone a pattern shift. The methodology has acquired more interactive and sociocultural dimension involving an active attitude of learners towards their own learning process. It has developed into the actionoriented approach which views learners as social agents: members of society who have to accomplish (not only) linguistic tasks in a wider social context. According to CEFR (2001) language teaching/learning should embrace both linguistic activities and socio-cultural, pragmatic aspects of interpersonal communication where language is seen as a means to achieve non-linguistic goals. This approach implies more intensive involvement of learners who become conscious of their own needs and internal abilities, they learn by doing, by interacting with other learners (Vygotsky’s theory) and by exploring independently the sociocultural reality of a foreign language. In order to achieve such didactic goals, course syllabuses and materials need to be organized on the basis of authentic texts which reveal patterns of actual language within a sociocultural context. Language corpora can be a significant source of a real use of language, providing learners with linguistic, sociocultural and pragmatic data that allow them to analyze lexical and grammatical structures that occur in given real-life situations. Therefore, they can constitute ideal materials for designing didactic activities which can increase the motivation of learners as well. The presentation will attempt to show some action-oriented didactic solutions concerning the use of language corpora in designing teaching/learning activities conducive to more effective language acquisition.",,10.32612/UW.20804814.2016.2.PP.29-41,https://doi.org/10.32612/UW.20804814.2016.2.PP.29-41,forward

To elicit the data, a DCT having 12 situations based on social power and distance was used and for perception data, these situations were analyzed on the basis of four contextual variables (degree of familiarity, power, difficulty, and obligation in expressing congratulations) in the form of SRQ. The criteria for the analysis of negative pragmatic was set on the differences found in the responses of the participants and the positive pragmatic transfer was based on the similarities between the responses of the participants. The data was coded and analyzed under the taxonomy of congratulations proposed by Elwood (2004). The results of the study indicated the presence of negative pragmatic transfer in three different strategies of congratulation (IFID, OOGW and Overlapped) and the remaining of the strategies indicated the existence of positive pragmatic transfer. The findings of the study show the cultural influence on the use of congratulation strategies by Punjabi EFL learners.

On the basis of the results, it is argued that learners with more opportunities for interaction approximate more closely to the native norm with respect to external modification and some aspects of internal modification of requests. Yet, it is shown that other aspects of internal modification remain underdeveloped, irrespective of frequency of contact with native speakers.

Es por ello que el conocimiento y la adquisicion de las estrategias de (des)cortesia es central en la integracion de las diferentes comunidades inmigrantes y, por tanto, en la consecucion de la cohesion social. Al mismo tiempo, ya sabemos que la prosodia afecta directamente a los juicios de cortesia en todas las lenguas en las que esta relacion ha sido estudiada, incluido el espanol (Devis 2011; Hidalgo 2009; Albelda 2012). Sin embargo, las senales prosodicas en las que los hablantes de diferentes lenguas se apoyan para juzgar el grado de cortesia parecen no ser las mismas. Mientras los hablantes de espanol como Ll aparentemente se apoyan mas en la entonacion a la hora de juzgar la cortesia de un enunciado en espanol (Devis 2011), los hablantes de chino como Ll parecen apoyarse mas en otros rasgos prosodicos al juzgar el grado de cortesia de un enunciado en chino. Este estudio pretende investigar si los inmigrantes chinos en Espana perciben la diferencia entre peticiones corteses y ordenes descorteses de la misma manera que los hablantes de espanol como Ll, cuando la diferencia entre estas peticiones y ordenes se encuentra unicamente en el nivel prosodico. Para ello, 22 inmigrantes chinos y 26 hablantes de espanol Ll escucharon y juzgaron el nivel de cortesia de 20 pares de ordenes y peticiones producidas por 4 hablantes de espanol Ll de Madrid (2 hombres y 2 mujeres). Los pares de peticiones y ordenes se caracterizaban por ser iguales desde el punto de vista lexico-gramatical y por diferir unicamente en los niveles prosodico y pragmatico. Los analisis estadisticos mostraron que, mientras las ordenes fueron percibidas de manera similar por los inmigrantes chinos y por los hablantes de espanol Ll, los primeros tuvieron problemas para percibir la intencion cortes en las peticiones corteses, que fueron consideradas mas corteses por los hablantes de espanol Ll que por los inmigrantes chinos. EnglishPoliteness plays a key role in cross-cultural communication and Intercultural adaptation (Spencer-Oatey and Franklin 2009). Therefore, knowledge about (im)politeness and the acquisition of politeness strategies is central in the integration of immigrants and the achievement of social cohesion. At the same time, prosody is already known to directly affect politeness judgements in all studied languages, including Ll Spanish (Hidalgo 2009; Devis 2011; Albelda 2012). However, the prosodic cues on which L 1 speakers rely when judging politeness seem to be different for each language. While Ll Spanish speakers seem to rely more on intonation when judging politeness (Devis 2011), Ll Chinese speakers tend to rely more on other prosodic cues when judging politeness in Chinese (Fan and Gu 2016). This study investigates whether Chinese immigrants in Spain perceive the difference between polite requests and impolite commands the same way Ll Spanish speakers do, when the only difference between the commands and requests is at the prosodic level. Chinese immigrants (N = 22) and Ll Spanish speakers (N = 26) listened to and judged the degree of politeness of 20 pairs of commands and requests produced by 4 Ll Spanish speakers (2 male + 2 female) from Madrid. Pairs of commands and requests had the same lexico-grammatical features and only differed at the prosodic and pragmatic levels. Statistical analysis revealed that while commands were perceived very similarly by Chinese immigrants and Ll Spanish speakers, Chinese speakers had problems perceiving the intention in polite requests, which were rated as more polite by Spanish native speakers than by Chinese immigrants.",,10.37536/LYM.12.2.2020.1026,https://doi.org/10.37536/LYM.12.2.2020.1026,forward

Because of a lack of research on migrant doctors (rather than migrant patients) and on pragmatic aspects of doctors' communication with patients (rather than on strictly linguistic aspects), the present study investigated the pragmatic competence of doctors using an L2 in their clinical setting. By means of discourse completion tasks, L1 and L2 doctors in Belgium and Sweden were studied in terms of how they modify their interactions with patients. Discrepancies were found between the different groups of doctors. The Belgian L1 doctors used more internal modification than their L2 colleagues (syntactic and lexical modification of their main message). The Belgian L2 doctors' underrepresentation of syntactic and lexical modification is counterbalanced by a native-like pattern for external modification, whereby these doctors seem to pay particular attention to consolidation. The Swedish L1 doctors used more external modification (adding an utterance after their main message) than their L2 colleagues, but the Swedish L2 doctors used more internal, syntactic modification which can be understood as an expression of an overcompensation strategy to ensure adequate mitigation and consolidation. Pragmatically, one type of Swedish L2 underrepresentation, i.e., external modification, is counterbalanced by another type of modification, i.e., internal modification.",,10.1515/iprg.2010.005,https://doi.org/10.1515/iprg.2010.005,forward

 Meta-analysis has become increasingly popular in second language acquisition research (SLA) and has provided valuable summative
 information about a number of key areas. There are, however, dangers. This article examines a number of key issues that need to be
 considered in conducting a meta-analysis – inclusiveness, the heterogeneity of language learners, the definition of the
 independent and dependent variables, the need to consider alternative explanations of observed effects, the importance of
 examining the quality of the studies included in the analysis, and the apples and oranges problem. These issues are illustrated in
 a discussion of number of SLA meta-analyses (e.g. Norris and Ortega, 2000; Plonsky, 2011; Qureshi, 2016; Spada and Tomita, 2010). The article concludes by suggesting a number of factors that
 need to be considered in deciding whether to conduct a meta-analysis and when carrying one out. I argue the need for systematic
 reviews but suggest that these can often best present their findings in narrative form rather than statistically. I also suggest
 that a preliminary narrative account of the findings of s systematic review can indicate whether a meta-analysis is
 appropriate.",,10.1075/JSLS.00002.ELL,https://doi.org/10.1075/JSLS.00002.ELL,forward

Studies in this field have been centred on the development of pragmatic competence (awareness) and teaching methods (Taguchi 2015), pragmatic testing and assessment (Roever 2011), as well as the distribution of pragmatic knowledge in textbooks (Ren and Han 2016), all of which focus mostly on learners’ language forms and strategies, yet ignore the role of modalities other than language forms in the process of meaning construction and expression, as well as the contribution of corpus linguistics to the study of pragmatic competence. Professor Zhanhao Jiang’s new book, Development and Application of a Multimodal Corpus for Learners’ Pragmatic Competence , is a timely attempt to address the paucity of studies in this respect, by presenting an interface study between multimodality, corpus linguistics and pragmatic competence.

N. Ishihara,2007.0,Web-based Curriculum for Pragmatics Instruction in Japanese as a Foreign Language: An Explicit Awareness-raising Approach,"Pragmatic ability has been recognised as an essential component of communicative competence (Canale & Swain, 1980; Hymes, 1972). However, it has been largely neglected in today's second/foreign language (L2) instruction and teacher education; few curricular attempts for teaching pragmatics have been made. This paper describes a web-based pragmatics curriculum for learners of Japanese as a foreign language, and presents the key components and principles of the curriculum. The curriculum takes an explicit pragmatic-focused awareness-raising approach (learners-as-researchers/ethnographers, Bardovi-Harlig, 1996; Tanaka, 1997) with the intention to instil in learners a sense of appropriate language use. A series of awareness-raising tasks are provided throughout the curriculum that features naturalistic audio samples and empirically established pragmatic information. Learners study L2 pragmatics through various exercises while self-checking or self-evaluating the answers and electronically sending exercise responses to the teachers and curriculum writer through the web system. During 2003–2004, this curriculum was adopted in a third year university course where learners independently completed an assigned portion of the curriculum for an introductory unit and two speech act units. The paper also explores the instructional impact on 18 learners' pragmatic awareness as found in their reflective journaling.",,10.2167/la398.0,https://doi.org/10.2167/la398.0,forward

Among different components of CC, a large number of L2 studies have attended to the construct pragmatic competence, which deals with both pragmalinguistic knowledge and sociopragmatic knowledge. As such, interlanguage pragmatics research is interested in the pragmatic competence and pragmatic performance of L2 learners; however, teaching pragmatics to Non-native Speakers (NNSs), especially EFL learners, is a thorny issue. As a result, pragmatic competence has been noticeably absent from ELT curricula, despite the fact that it has an assured place in different models of CC. The reasons for this neglect lie behind the obstacles to teaching and learning pragmatics in the ESL/EFL classroom settings. Thus, drawing on the published literature, this very paper primarily aims at discussing challenges and lacunas in teaching and learning pragmatics within the confines of EFL classrooms. Subsequent to this, the paper enlists suggestions to overcome these obstacles. To this end, the paper focuses on four broad areas: the EFL context, ELT materials and resources available to L2 learners in the EFL context, teacher education, and assessment of pragmatic knowledge.",,10.20535/2410-8286.108300,https://doi.org/10.20535/2410-8286.108300,forward

The target linguistic forms were Korean honorifics, which are closely related to Korean culture, honoring the elderly by using a different set of linguistic features. Twenty-nine learners of Korean were divided into two groups: collaborative and individual writing groups. The collaborative group completed e-mail writing tasks in pairs, whereas students in the individual group carried out the same tasks alone. During the tasks, indirect SWCF was provided on the target pragmatic features (i.e., honorifics). Think-aloud protocols and pair talk were audio-recorded. Students’ attention to linguistic forms was operationalized as the occurrence of language-related episodes (LREs), and their processing of SWCF was determined using feedback-related episodes (FREs). Uptake was identified based on students’ final writing output. The findings suggest that the collaborative group resolved linguistic errors more accurately than the individual group. In terms of the linguistic target features and uptake of SWCF, both groups demonstrated similar patterns, suggesting mediating effects of SWCF on students’ task performance.",,10.1080/09658416.2021.1937194,https://doi.org/10.1080/09658416.2021.1937194,forward

"Honghui Zhou, Wenqi Zeng",2023.0,A Pragmatic Study on Primary School English Textbooks in Mainland China,"English pragmatic competence in primary schools of mainland China has received increasing attention and the related issues have become popular research topics, but most former studies are limited to classroom teaching and particularly few on English textbooks of primary school. This study makes a pragmatic evaluation on the current primary school English textbooks in mainland China by taking a set of popular textbooks as an example. Adopting Cooperative Principle as theoretical frame, it mainly investigates and analyzes the conversational interactions in the textbooks, and the statistics shows that the textbooks generally conform to Grice’s “idealized communication model”, but there still exist many “odd” utterances which violate the maxims of Cooperative Principle, especially the Q-maxim and the M-maxim, while do not produce any conversational implicature in Grice’s sense. It thus concludes the pragmatic features of the textbook as “low naturalness”, “singularity in type” and “weak culturality”. This study is expected to act as a move for further research in this domain and a call on further improving the pragmaticity of primary school English textbooks in mainland China.",,10.61935/asder.1.1.2023.p93,https://doi.org/10.61935/asder.1.1.2023.p93,forward

"Naoko Taguchi, Feng Xiao, Shuai Li",2016.0,Effects of Intercultural Competence and Social Contact on Speech Act Production in a Chinese Study Abroad Context.,"This study investigated the effects of intercultural competence and amount of social contact in the development of pragmatic knowledge. All these variables were time-varying variables and measured twice over a 3-month study abroad. Participants were 109 American college students studying Chinese in a semester study-abroad program in Beijing. Using Kelley & Meyers's (1995) instrument, intercultural competence-defined as one's potential to succeed in intercultural adjustment-was measured by 4 factors: emotional resilience, flexibility/openness, perceptual acuity, and personal autonomy. A survey was used to assess the amount of time spent on a variety of social activities in Chinese. Pragmatic knowledge was measured with a spoken task, which assessed participants' ability to produce speech acts ( k = 24). Latent Growth Curve Modeling showed that cross-cultural adaptability and social contact, when combined, explained 26% of pragmatic gains. Cross-cultural adaptability had no significant direct effect to speech acts gains: It had indirect effects through social contact.

 The present study revisits the differential roles of form, meaning, and use aspects of phonological vocabulary knowledge in L2 listening proficiency. A total of 126 Japanese English-as-a-foreign-language listeners completed the TOEIC Listening test, working memory and auditory processing tests, the Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire, and several tasks designed to tap into three broad aspects of phonological vocabulary knowledge: (1) the ability to access phonological forms without any orthographic cues (phonologization), (2) the ability to recognize words regardless of the talker (generalization), and (3) the ability to determine the semantic and collocational appropriateness of words in global contexts in a fast and stable manner (automatization). Whereas the perceptual, cognitive, and metacognitive variables made relatively small contributions to L2 listening proficiency (0.4%–21.3%), the vocabulary factors explained a large amount of the variance (77.6%) in the full regression model (R2 = .507). These large lexical effects uniquely derived from the three different aspects of phonological vocabulary knowledge—automatization (55.3%), phonologization (20.8%), and generalization (1.5%). The findings suggest that successful L2 listening skill acquisition draws on not only various levels of phonological form-meaning mapping (phonologization, generalization) but also the spontaneous and robust retrieval of such vocabulary knowledge in relation to surrounding words (automatization).",,10.1017/s027226312300044x,https://doi.org/10.1017/s027226312300044x,forward

 The present study examines the apologetic behavior of Saudi learners of English in a foreign language learning context. The study
 also investigates the influence of language exposure, gender, distance and dominance on the learners’ apologies. To this end, a
 Discourse Completion Test was completed by (1) 411 Saudi learners of English, (2) 42 native speakers of Saudi Arabic and (3) 47
 native speakers of English. The groups of native speakers provided the norms of apologetic behavior in the learners’ first (L1)
 and second (L2) languages. The results showed the Saudi participants’ preference for face-saving strategies to both the speaker
 and hearer, and a positive influence for increased L2 exposure on the learners’ pragmatic competence. The variables of gender,
 distance and dominance also proved influential but to varying degrees. The results are interpreted in light of the existing
 literature and theoretical models. Pedagogical implications and research directions are proposed.",,10.1075/PS.16048.ELD,https://doi.org/10.1075/PS.16048.ELD,forward

Also, L2 learners’ use of culturally specific expressions, such as proverbs, has not been adequately investigated. The present study investigated the effects of telecollaboration on L2 learners’ perceptions of their ICC knowledge and skills in relation to one type of verbal communication (proverbs) in Japanese. Nineteen L2 novice learners of Japanese were involved in the study, and they telecollaborated with 23 native speakers of Japanese using Facebook. They learned Japanese proverbs through Facebook videos introduced by their Japanese peers, followed by in-class follow up sessions and a reflection log activity, and they then performed skits in Japanese. Their perceptions of their ICC knowledge and skills were compared using the pre- and the post-questionnaires, and their language production was analyzed.

Drawing on the framework of Exploratory Practice (Allwright, 2005), the present study examines how intermediate-level Taiwanese students of English enrolled in an advanced writing class developed greater pragmatic awareness in email literacy. Instruction was divided into four distinct stages: Setting the context, Modelling, Joint construction and Independent construction. The outcomes, gleaned through questionnaires, class discussions, student presentations, and pre- and post-instruction emails, provide striking evidence of greater pragmatic awareness and positive attitudes towards instruction on email literacy, and pinpoint aspects of email literacy which may require more instructional attention.

Holger Limberg,2015.0,Principles for pragmatics teaching: Apologies in the EFL classroom,"Intercultural Communicative Competence is a paramount goal of modern foreign language teaching. It is the ability to communicate in culturally sensitive and contextually appropriate ways with speakers from other cultures. Being able to apologize is one component of this competence. Uttering apologies allows learners to rectify breaches of social norms in order to restore social harmony and maintain rapport with others. This pragmatic competence is gradually acquired in one’s foreign language education, alongside the building blocks of the foreign language, viz. grammar and lexis. Even though the teaching of pragmatics is a complex undertaking and often challenging to plan in a systematic way, teachers can follow certain principles when designing tasks and preparing lessons in which learners’ apology competence is targeted. This article provides a synthesis of relevant research findings on apologies and suggests principles for tasks and activities in the classroom that help to attain pragmatic teaching goals.",,10.1093/ELT/CCV012,https://doi.org/10.1093/ELT/CCV012,forward

First, instructors used overt forms of stylistic variants in class significantly more frequently than native speakers did in conversations. Second, learners tended to overuse the overt forms compared with their native speaker peers. Third, learner patterns of stylistic variation aligned closely with those of their teachers. Finally, unlike teacher input, textbook input demonstrated mixed results compared with learner patterns.

Yet, teachers’ perceptions of pragmatics and teaching pragmatics has yet to be closely investigated in the context of Moroccan higher education and therefore remains uncharted in literature. To address these gaps, the present study explored how Moroccan university professors view pragmatics and pragmatic teaching. It also explored how they use their pragmatic knowledge in the classroom. A total of 10 university professors (6 males and 4 females) from two public universities (Moulay Ismail and Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah) in Morocco participated in the current study. Quantitative data were collected by completing an anonymous questionnaire, while qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Participants expressed their perceptions and described experiences of the importance of teaching pragmatics, issues related to culture and identity in teaching English as a Foreign Language, and materials and tasks in teaching pragmatics. The findings yielded that linguistic knowledge is as essential as pragmatic knowledge. Thus, striking a balance between pragmatic and grammatical competence and teaching them simultaneously is crucial. Learners with advanced grammatical knowledge may fail to use the target language appropriately. As such, the results indicated that some teachers are unaware of the importance of introducing pragmatics to students in the early stages of learning English. Their skills are enough to be good at transmitting cultural knowledge and suitable language competence to students.

An investigation into the effects of video-driven prompts on less-studied and more complex teaching speech acts, such as complaints, will significantly supplement the inconclusive results of pragmatic interventional studies in foreign language contexts. To this end, the present study aims to investigate the effects of metapragmatic instruction on English complaints through the implementation of video-driven prompts to raise Saudi female EFL students’ awareness of the pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic aspects associated with the production of appropriate and accurate target-like complaints during one academic semester. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to collect data from 62 English majors, assigned to an experimental group (n = 31) and a conventional group (n = 31), at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia. To elicit the required data, a proficiency test and pre-/post-test written discourse completion tests (WDCT) were distributed among participants. The results of the posttest demonstrated significant improvement in participants’ pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic skills in the production of English complaints. The experimental group immensely outperformed the control group due to their exposure to authentic, contextualized video excerpts. The study supports the teachability of complaints as well as the benefits of incorporating metapragmatic awareness tasks based on contextually authentic input, which can, in turn, accelerate EFL students’ ability to produce pragmatically appropriate and accurate target-like complaints.",,10.31235/osf.io/n9uc7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n9uc7,forward

The AESCT is intended to be used as a learning-oriented assessment in university-level applied linguistics classes. This study collected evidence on construct validity supporting the AESCT design as a measure of pragmatic comprehension and for providing feedback in low-stakes learning contexts; 97 university-level English language learners took the AESCT along with the Cambridge Placement Test and a background questionnaire on their exposure to target language input. Descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and linear regression were used to analyze aspects of construct validity. Results indicate that the AESCT is sufficiently reliable.

Video excerpts of disagreement sequences collected from two ESL classes were used to examine how the participating ESL students understand and respond to the natural L2 interactions in small group discussions. The analyses show that the students use their auditory and visual access to the authentic sequences in the audiovisual input to analyse and evaluate the targeted speech act: (1) they draw on the video excerpts' rich contextual information to engage in similar situational contexts and develop an affiliative understanding of the pragmatic practices used; (2) they compare different disagreement practices, make informed decisions regarding their pragmatic options, and even search for justifications for their choices; and (3) they monitor the vocal and visual conduct surrounding the focal action and utilise their observations to justify their assessments of the pragmatic practice. Therefore, using video recordings and conversion-analysis-informed transcripts of authentic interactions bears clear pedagogical value by enhancing L2 speakers' awareness of contextual factors around speech act sequences, their pragmatic choices, and the multimodal character of pragmatic actions.",,10.1080/09658416.2016.1154568,https://doi.org/10.1080/09658416.2016.1154568,forward

This study attempts to deal with pragmatic problems by using a mix of mental grounding techniques and pragmatic activities (awareness-raising activities). The sample of the study comprised participants from Iraq and the Czech Republic. They were first-year college students. The researchers depended on learning zones to determine the suitable time for the experiment (fear zone). The researchers applied self-report surveys in addition to interviews to determine the students with pragmatic problems. Then, at the end of the experiment, the participants were interviewed again to evaluate the experiment in addition to the same self-report survey. Results showed that the two samples responded positively to the mix of techniques used. Moreover, the division of learning zones seems ideal to be dependent in the present study as it specifies the time of challenge the students experienced. The results also clarified that the mix of the two types of activities (pragmatic and grounding activities) demonstrates a kind of remedy that could enhance students’ level of pragmatics. In the end, no sharp differences were mentioned in the two contexts of the study (Iraq and the Czech Republic); both gained approximate positive results.",,10.24815/siele.v10i3.28517,https://doi.org/10.24815/siele.v10i3.28517,forward

Despite advances in research in both L2 pragmatics and humor studies, scholars have as yet had little to say on this topic. In interviews, learners themselves pinpoint culture, vocabulary, and the speed at which playful talk often takes place as difficulties. Yet, as we know, hypothetical self-reports of language use can be quite unreliable. Thus, this exploratory study aimed to examine L2 understanding of humor more systematically. Six advanced non-native speakers (NNSs) of English kept diaries in which they recorded their experiences with humor in English over an eight-week period. Group meetings were also held every two weeks during this time to allow the participants to elaborate on, interpret, and discuss their experiences. For the present study, all instances of failed humor were extracted and coded. These were used to construct a typology of failed humor, which identifies seven levels at which a speaker may fail to successfully engage in a humorous exchange. The data suggest that NNS failures differ from those of NSs largely from a quantitative, but not qualitative, standpoint.",,10.1515/iprg.2010.019,https://doi.org/10.1515/iprg.2010.019,forward

"Myrto Grigoroglou, A. Papafragou",2017.0,Acquisition of Pragmatics,"How do children learn to bridge the gap between the literal, semantic meaning of words and the intended, pragmatic meaning of an utterance? The acquisition of pragmatics is the topic of an experimental field of study that investigates this question. According to an influential pragmatic theory proposed by the philosopher Paul Grice, communication is a collaborative effort governed by specific rules (or “maxims”). A collaborative speaker is expected to be as informative as required by the purpose of the communicative exchange (maxim of Quantity), truthful (maxim of Quality), relevant (maxim of Relation), and unambiguous (maxim of Manner). A collaborative listener makes inferences about the speaker’s intentions based on the assumption that the speaker is being cooperative and following the conversational rules. Later pragmatic theories such as Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson’s relevance theory have offered important alternatives to the Gricean framework but share several foundational assumptions with Grice’s approach, including the idea that human communication involves representing the speaker’s beliefs and goals. Whether young children are capable of making such inferences about the speaker’s mental states and how aspects of this ability might develop are the most important questions in the study of children’s pragmatic development. For many years, it was believed that children before the age of five or six were not able to entertain pragmatic inferences about the speaker’s intentions or knowledge state. However, more recent theoretical advancements in the semantics-pragmatics interface and the development of new methodological tools have led to a reconsideration of older findings. It appears increasingly likely that the skills required for pragmatic reasoning are in place from a very young age, but the process of applying those skills in communication is effortful and highly task dependent, and continues to develop until late childhood. This article focuses on prominent work on the acquisition of children’s pragmatic abilities in three areas that have generated a considerable body of data: Reference, Implicature, and Figurative Language.",,10.1093/ACREFORE/9780199384655.013.217,https://doi.org/10.1093/ACREFORE/9780199384655.013.217,forward

Ignoring politeness as a subject of instruction could be due to the hypothesis that politeness is ingrained in the culture of its use and hence cannot be taught to EFL learners. To investigate this hypothesis, politeness markers proposed by House and Kasper (1981) in their politeness framework were used as the point of departure to teach these markers to two groups of EFL students using film-driven input-enhancement tasks and output tasks. The results of the study revealed the beneficial effect of teaching politeness markers through the two tasks. Whereas the input-enhancement group improved significantly in their comprehension of politeness markers, the output group manifested more gains in their production of these markers. Findings from this study have implications for interlanguage pragmatic instruction, suggesting that politeness is teachable and that different instructional tasks bring about different effects on the production and comprehension of politeness markers.",,10.1177/0033688214555357,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033688214555357,forward

The question of how to teach toward social, cultural and linguistic L2 pragmatic competence has raised serious challenges (Kasper, 1997). This is more the case for spoken rather than written discourse. As can be expected, the underlying pragmatic implications of spontaneous face-to-face communication naturally constrains the interactional scope and its potential pedagogical application. To address this issue, this naturalistic study explores two key potential contributors to the development of oral pragmatic competence: meta-pragmatic classroom conversational discourse and the course framework supporting that kind of relatively spontaneous interaction. An English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course provided fluency practice protocols, instruction in pragmatic categories, analysis of conversational data and “live” in-class intervention, focusing on meaning and alternate expressions and forms. Those interventions were designed to enhance learners’ ability to self-assess, monitor and expand their interactional repertoires. Part of a larger research project examining principles of pragmatics applied in EAP instruction, this study focuses on data from spontaneous classroom interactions situated within the integrated instructional framework of the course. Results present a range of strategies employed by the instructor consistent with current theoretical models of factors or pedagogical interventions that facilitate development of pragmatic competence.",,10.1075/PL.20011.VAN,https://doi.org/10.1075/PL.20011.VAN,forward
M. Gomez-Laich,2016.0,Second Language Learners' Divergence from Target Language Pragmatic Norms.,"Pragmatic competence is an indispensable aspect of language ability in order for second and foreign language (L2/FL) learners to understand and be understood in their interactions with both native and nonnative speakers of the target language. Without a proper understanding of the pragmatic rules in the target language, learners may run the risk of coming across as insensitive and rude. Several researchers (Bardovi-Harlig, 2001; Kasper & Rose, 2002) suggest that L2 pragmatics not only can be taught in the L2/FL classroom, but, more importantly, that explicit approaches that involve direct explanation of target pragmatic features are beneficial for learning pragmatics. Just as native speakers of a language acquire a “set of dispositions to act in certain ways, which generates cognitive and bodily practices in the individual” (Watts, 2003, p. 149), instructors can help learners to become aware of the pragmatic features that characterize the target language. Although the importance of explicit teaching of pragmatics is well recognized in the literature, learning norms and rules of pragmatics largely depends on learners’ subjectivity. Learners’ convergence or divergence from the L2 pragmatic norms, both consciously and out of awareness, sometimes depends on whether these norms fit their image of self and their L1 cultural identity. Since identity-related conflict can have significant consequences for the acquisition of second language pragmatics, failing to consider the centrality of learners’ identities will produce an inadequate understanding of SLA. This paper synthesizes studies that document the reasons why learners opt to remain foreign by resisting certain L2 practic-es. The following synthesis question was proposed: Why do language learners resist the pragmatic norms of the target language?",,10.14746/SSLLT.2016.6.2.4,https://doi.org/10.14746/SSLLT.2016.6.2.4,forward

Typically, telecollaboration involves the application of global computer networks in foreign language study (e.g., Warschauer, 1996) for the purposes of linguistic development and intercultural learning. In particular, we focus on the ‘microgenesis’ or development of the T/V distinction in pronouns of address as a test case representative of broader L2 pragmatic concerns. We present two detailed case studies of this phenomenon: one for French (tu vs. vous) and one for German (du vs. Sie). The rationale for this type of analysis emerges from Vygotsky's developmental approach to cognition (1978) where it is emphasized that development can only be understood by specifying its history. We argue that, in contrast to the traditional language classroom, the telecollaborative language class provides the le...",,10.3138/CMLR.59.2.189,https://doi.org/10.3138/CMLR.59.2.189,forward
"Ahmed Alduais, Issa Al-Qaderi, Hind Alfadda",2022.0,Pragmatic Language Development: Analysis of Mapping Knowledge Domains on How Infants and Children Become Pragmatically Competent,"New-borns are capable of recognising and producing sounds as they become phonologically competent. Following this, infants develop a system for connecting these sounds, which helps them become increasingly lexically competent over time. Their knowledge of these words grows as they develop, using words to form phrases, turning them into sentences, and ultimately becoming syntactically competent. By making sense of these linguistic elements, these three competencies are enhanced, and this is how infants become semantically competent. As infants continue to develop linguistic and non-linguistic communication behaviours, this miraculous language development becomes even more complex, enabling them to perfect their linguistic abilities while being pragmatically competent. In this study, a scientometric approach was used to examine past, present, and future trends in pragmatic language development (PLD). A total of 6455 documents were analysed from the Scopus, WOS, and Lens databases between 1950 and 2022. The analysis involved the visualisation and tabulation of eight bibliometric and eight scientometric indicators using CiteSpace 5.8.R3 and VOSviewer 1.6.18 software for data analysis. In this study, we highlight the major patterns and topics directing the research on PLD between 1950 and 2022. The themes and topics included (1) analysing PLD as a social behaviour through the lens of executive functions; (2) studying PLD as a social behaviour based on social understanding; (3) examining PLD as a social behaviour associated with autism spectrum disorder; (4) developing an understanding of PLD in academic settings through the examination of executive functions; (5) identifying pragmatic competence versus communicative competence as a social behaviour; (6) analysing pragmatic language skills in aphasic patients via epistemic stances (i.e., attitudes towards knowledge in interaction); (7) investigating PLD as a behavioural problem in the context of a foreign language; (8) assessing PLD as a behavioural problem in individuals with autism spectrum disorder; (9) assessing PLD in persons with traumatic brain injury and closed head injury as a behavioural problem; (10) identifying the role of the right hemisphere in executive functions as a cognitive substrate; (11) assessing the impact of pragmatic failure in speech acts on pragmatic competence; and (12) investigating the patterns of PLD among learning-disabled children.",,10.3390/children9091407,https://doi.org/10.3390/children9091407,forward

Major findings derived from the study highlighted the fact that Iranian advanced EFL learners with higher repertoire of multiword lexical knowledge demonstrated higher pragmatic ability and outperformed in expressing the speech act of request. On the account of findings, it is inferred that knowledge of multiword lexical items is of paramount importance for interactions in different contexts in general and expressing the politeness strategies in particular.

Fred Seizo Tsutagawa,2013.0,Pragmatic Knowledge and Ability in the Applied Linguistics and Second Language Assessment Literature: A Review,"Almost forty years after Stalnaker’s (1974) initial call for “the development and application of a pragmatic theory in which detailed explanations of phenomena relating to linguistic contexts can be given” (p. 214), a unifying construct definition and theory still does not exist to explain fully pragmatic knowledge and ability (Roever, 2011, 2013). Given that test validity and reliability are crucial concerns in the field of second language (L2) assessment, it is important that we try to develop a more comprehensive theoretical construct, so that tests of pragmatic ability will have more construct validity, better represent the target language use (TLU) domain of the test construct, and thus have results that are hopefully more generalizable and useful to stakeholders. This paper presents a brief review of the extensive pragmatics literature and examines how the construct of pragmatic knowledge and ability has been operationalized from the perspective of theoretical and applied linguists. The paper presents (1) an introduction to the theoretical foundations of pragmatics, (2) a brief survey of applied empirical studies in L2 pragmatics, and (3) an overview of how the L2 assessment field has conceptualized pragmatic knowledge and ability, looking also at the various theoretical frameworks that have been proposed and utilized. Validation studies for the assessment models, although scarce, are discussed where appropriate. Lastly, some general ideas and suggestions are offered to help lead us towards a unifying construct definition of pragmatic knowledge and ability.",,10.7916/D8BZ65NN,https://doi.org/10.7916/D8BZ65NN,forward
A. Liddicoat,2006.0,Learning the culture of interpersonal relationships: Students' understandings of personal address forms in French,"Abstract The French pronoun system presents a particular difficulty for English-speaking learners of French with the distinction between the second person pronouns tu and vous. In textbooks, these pronouns are typically described in terms of politeness or formality but the reality is much more complex. In addition, the pronouns interact with address terms such as first name, title + last name and title + first name, which give the system further complexity. While the language structures involved are simple, the cultural context in which they are deployed is complex and involves an understanding of how interpersonal relationships are constructed and communicated through the French language. This paper will explore students' learning of aspects of the French address system from an intercultural perspective and examine the ways in which learners come to construct their own personal understandings of interpersonal relationships as they are represented in and through French.",,10.1515/IP.2006.003,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP.2006.003,forward

Listening instruction that is based on the theory of discourse markers can significantly enhance college students’ listening proficiency; therefore, it is significant and necessary to study the relationship between explicit and implicit instruction in discourse markers and listening proficiency in English as Foreign Language environment. Based on the elaborate experimental design and accurate statistical analysis, the conclusion can be drawn that in the short run, explicit instruction in discourse markers can improve listening proficiency immediately in contrast with the effect of implicit instruction that is not significant, but in the long term, however, the differences between the explicit and the implicit disappear and the implicit can improve listening proficiency as well as teaching performance apparently.",,10.5539/ELLS.V4N1P48,https://doi.org/10.5539/ELLS.V4N1P48,forward

Gillian Mansfield,2014.0,Mind the gap between form and function. Teaching pragmatics with the British sitcom in the foreign language classroom,"Abstract This article intends to show how situation comedies may be used in the English language classroom to develop awareness-raising activities aimed at soliciting an understanding of essentially pragmatic and cultural aspects of everyday language. After a brief overview of studies on pragmatic teachability (Rose and Kasper 2001, 2002) and learnability (Taguchi 2011) in the language classroom over the last twenty years or so, verbal humour in situation comedy will be investigated with a view to presenting learners with the kinds of word play that are clearly intended to invoke laughter. With reference to a second-year degree course in modern languages at the University of Parma (Italy), it will be seen how learners can be motivated to resort to previously acquired theoretical knowledge of various pragmatic expedients (Brown and Levinson 1978; Leech 1983; Levinson 1984; Yule 1996) with a view to recognizing the intended illocutionary force of utterances and exchanges in the light of Grice's (1975) co-operative principle in conversation. This approach is justified by Bouton's (1994) claim that an understanding of implicature is a necessary learning target. Although it comprises written-to-be-spoken text, the situation comedy is an excellent source of “real” everyday language in which Grice's maxims are constantly broken or flouted through intentional ambiguity for the purposes of provoking laughter. By encouraging learners to perceive the fuzzy line of demarcation between the form and communicative function of words and phrases in the ongoing exchange structure of a conversation, it will be possible to see how they become more motivated to search for examples of their own (Bardovi-Harlig 1996) and discuss them with the teacher during their post-course assessment. The teacher is thus able not only to discern whether learners have effectively become more aware of the subtleties and implicatures of language meaning in the creation of verbal humour, but also incidentally, benefit from a subsequent addition to her sitcom corpus for future courses.",,10.1515/cercles-2013-0020,https://doi.org/10.1515/cercles-2013-0020,forward

This study tries to investigate the learnability of compliments in a formal foreign language context.

The results were examined through a t-test providing some evidence that instruction in pragmatics can make a positive difference in a formal context.

This study describes the development and validation of a 36-item web-based test of ESL pragmalinguistics, measuring learners’ offline knowledge of implicatures and routines with multiple-choice questions, and their knowledge of speech acts with discourse completion tests. The test was delivered online to 267 ESL and EFL learners, ranging in proficiency from beginner to advanced. Evidence for construct validity was collected through correlational analyses and comparisons between groups. The effect of browser familiarity was found to be negligible, and learners generally performed as previous research would suggest: their knowledge of speech acts increased with proficiency, as did their knowledge of implicature. Their knowledge of routines, however, was strongly dependent on L2 exposure. Correlations between the sections and factor analysis confirmed that the routines, implicatures, and speech act sections are related but that each has some unique variance. The test was sufficiently reliable and practical, taking an hour to administer and little time to score. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.",,10.1191/0265532206lt329oa,https://doi.org/10.1191/0265532206lt329oa,forward

The structure of the paper is as follows: after a brief overview of the literature in the field of ILP with a special focus on WDCT, the validity of the methodology is highlighted through the discussion of issues relating to labelling/coding categories as well as interannotator (dis)agreements. By analysing and comparing utterances on the basis of our annotation output and validating the results with the aid of ReCal, we have confirmed that WDCT is a reliable and valid tool for testing ILP competence in speech acts performance.",,10.1515/ausp-2017-0018,https://doi.org/10.1515/ausp-2017-0018,forward
Karen Glaser,2014.0,The Neglected Combination: A Case for Explicit-Inductive Instruction in Teaching Pragmatics in ESL,"A substantial part of interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) research has contrasted ex- plicit and implicit teaching designs, generally finding that explicit approaches— those featuring metapragmatic rule provision—are more effective than their implicit counterparts, which are characterized by the absence of metapragmatic information. A second dichotomy used to characterize instructional designs, that of deductive vs. inductive approaches, has received somewhat less attention. Con- cerned with the sequencing of the instruction rather than the criterion of whether or not to provide rules, this concerns the question of whether to choose (deductive) rules or (inductive) language use as the starting point of the instruction. Although the two dichotomies are interrelated, they are often unjustifiably merged, with the labels deductive and explicit, on the one hand, and inductive and implicit, on the other, being used interchangeably. This article illustrates the reasons for this oversimplification and argues that the resulting focus on the contrast of explicit-deductive and implicit-inductive designs has led to overlooking a third possible constellation: the explicit-inductive framework. Adopting a classroom perspective, the article further attempts to point out the advantages that this neglected combination can have for the teaching and learning of pragmatics in ESL.",,10.18806/TESL.V30I7.1158,https://doi.org/10.18806/TESL.V30I7.1158,forward

The analysis is divided into two parts: the first investigates distributional frequencies of nine central modals across the two corpora; the second explores and compares the semantics of four selected modal auxiliaries (must, can, may, and should) in the two corpora. If it is assumed that textbooks should be an accurate reflection of authentic native speakers’ language use, then support for the acquisition of modality in the textbooks proved to be less than ideal. Although there is a reasonably good coverage of modals in the textbooks in terms of frequency, the semantic analysis reveals discrepancies between the native corpus and the textbooks. Learners are exposed to a limited range of meanings that do not fully reflect authentic use. Findings are also discussed from an alternate perspective whereby strong representations of potentially difficult to acquire uses of modals in the textbooks can be seen as beneficial for acquisition.Résumé:Les auteures étudient la modalité dans les manuels destinés aux apprenants de l’anglais en analysant la fréquence et la distribution des verbes modaux dans deux corpora—celui de la langue des locuteurs natifs authentiques et celui, pédagogique, qu’utilisent les apprenants francophones de l’anglais au Québec—, dans le but de définir les domaines dans lesquels une aide supplémentaire à l’apprentissage pourrait être bénéfique. L’analyse se divise en deux volets : dans le premier, les auteures étudient la distribution des fréquences de neuf expressions centrales de la modalité dans les deux corpora ; dans le second volet, elles explorent et comparent la sémantique de quatre auxiliaires modaux sélectionnés (must, can, may et should) dans les deux corpora. Si l’on tient pour acquis que les manuels devraient être le reflet fidèle de l’usage du langage chez les locuteurs natifs authentiques, l’aide à l’acquisition de la modalité dans les manuels s’est révélée bien moins qu’idéale. Même si les modes sont raisonnablement bien traités dans les manuels en ce qui a trait à la fréquence, l’analyse sémantique met en lumière des divergences entre le corpus natif et celui des manuels. Les apprenants sont exposés à un éventail limité de sens qui ne reflètent pas entièrement l’usage authentique. Ces constats sont également analysés dans une autre perspective selon laquelle des représentations fortes d’usages de modes potentiellement difficiles à acquérir, dans les manuels, peuvent être considérées comme étant favorables à l’acquisition.",,10.3138/CMLR.3075,https://doi.org/10.3138/CMLR.3075,forward

In the present study, we attempt to develop EFL learners’ metapragmatic awareness of English compliments, which still remains an under-researched issue. Initially, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with intermediate-level Iranian EFL learners, Persian and British English native speakers. Although the analysis of the language learners’ realization of compliments and responses to compliments seemed to indicate that their pragmatic development was overall adequate, it also suggested the influence of the native socio-pragmatic schema on their pragmatic performance. We therefore undertook a pragmatic instruction aimed at developing the EFL learners’ metapragmatic awareness of complimenting. The results suggested that through discussion, analysis, small-scale research, and reflections on the native and target pragmalinguistic and socio-pragmatic complimenting conventions the learners were developing metapragmatic awareness.

The game in this study showcases several scenarios to players, including virtual conversations between learners and professors, employers, and friends on a virtual American campus. 105 undergraduate students from a university in China participated in this study, covering 10 virtual request scenarios. They are supposed to choose the most appropriate expression in the context presented in the text and video. According to their choice, the corresponding video of the game will display real-time feedback from the interlocutor, which is the authentic reaction and consequence of the learner’s selection, that is, the other party’s response to the request, such as happily accepting, reluctantly accepting, or refusing the request. The results indicate that in game-based teaching, learners gain much more productive knowledge than receptive knowledge. The participants improved their productive knowledge of making requests after playing the game and maintained this gain at delayed post-tests, but their receptive knowledge remained almost unchanged. In addition, metapragmatic knowledge is positively correlated with the participants’ learning outcome of request-making.",,10.56397/jlcs.2023.12.08,https://doi.org/10.56397/jlcs.2023.12.08,forward

To this end, upon the completion of the study search, the retrieved articles were selected and analyzed based on the research domain.  The results of our synthesis from 54 studies carried out on the instruction of the speech act not only reveal that pragmatics is amenable to instruction but also unfold that the most frequently instructed speech act is the speech act of request which has been conducted in 29 studies, while the least instructed speech act is  invitation, used in only one study. Moreover, analyzing the data collection methods documented that Multiple-choice Discourse Completion Test (MDCT) is the most predominant method utilized in 36 papers during the last decades in English pragmatic instruction. With respect to the treatment types, it is illuminated that the most recurrent treatment type is explicit, implicit vs. control, followed by explicit vs. implicit, although other treatment types have been embarked on. As a final point, it is worth noting that 53 of the conducted studies utilized the quantitative method in their data analyses, whereas only one study implemented the qualitative method.

"P. Birjandi, Maryam Pezeshki",2013.0,The Effect of Self-Assessment and Conference on EFL Students’ Production of Speech Acts and Politeness Markers: Alternatives on the Horizon?,"Alternative assessment approaches received considerable attention soon after a discontent with traditional, one-shot testing. These approaches, however, have been used only to improve learners’ linguistic ability despite communicative models of language which pointed that knowledge of language also involves pragmatic ability (Bachman, 1990; Bachman & Palmer, 1996). The present study tries to explore the effect of two alternative assessment approaches (self-assessment and conference) on students’ production of four speech acts (apology, complaint, request, and refusal) plus politeness markers. A sample of 64 EFL students participated in this study. Metapragmatic explanations were given to three groups of university students studying English as a foreign language. The two treatment groups received instruction through self-assessment and conference and a comparison group was exposed to the conventional one-shot testing. The results of the One-Way ANOVA conducted after the treatment revealed an outperformance of alternative assessment approaches to the conventional one in the production of the four speech acts and politeness markers in WDCTs. A qualitative analysis of students’ self-ratings in the self-assessment group revealed that they focused more on linguistic criteria during the initial sessions and on pragmatic ones by the end of the treatment. It can be concluded that alternative assessment approaches are beneficial to students’ production of speech acts and politeness markers. In the end, the applicability and the positive effect of alternative approaches in pragmatic assessment are emphasized.",,10.22111/IJALS.2013.1642,https://doi.org/10.22111/IJALS.2013.1642,forward
L. Yates,2015.0,Intercultural communication and the transnational: managing impressions at work,"Abstract Whether in pursuit of a safer place to live, economic advancement or simply from a desire to travel, increasing numbers of professionals find themselves working outside familiar cultural settings and using a language in which they did not train. As a country of migration, Australia is home to many such transnationals. Despite high levels of proficiency in English, however, many find that communication at work can be something of a challenge, and that different perspectives on professional roles and identities as well as differences in pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic assumptions can become invisible barriers to success and progression. In this article I will draw on recent research into the demands of two different professions, childcare and medicine, to consider some of the issues faced by transnationals seeking to master not only the language but also the professional and community cultures underlying talk at work. I argue that language instruction programs designed to prepare new arrivals to enter the workforce should include explicit attention to cultural values based on empirical evidence in order to increase understanding of both how and why people talk the way they do in different working environments.",,10.1515/multi-2014-0063,https://doi.org/10.1515/multi-2014-0063,forward

The present study compared the short-term and long-term effects of individual and collaborative output-based instruction on EFL learners’ acquisition of English “apologies,” “requests,” and “refusals.” For this purpose, 54 intermediate EFL learners, making up an individual output group (N=26) and a collaborative output group (N=28), participated in the study. Individual and collaborative output-based instruction was offered over nine consecutive sessions (three sessions on each speech act). Each of the nine treatment sessions involved the presentation of video input containing the speech acts under investigation, followed by individual and collaborative output production and manipulation tasks. Moreover, a 24-item WDCT was used to measure the participants’ speech act production ability at the pre-treatment, immediate post-treatment, and delayed post-treatment phases of the study. The results indicated significant gains for both individual and collaborative output groups from the pretest to the immediate and delayed posttests, and the greater efficacy of collaborative output over individual output. The findings reveal the potential of learner output, both individual and collaborative, for ILP development and the greater advantage collaborative output production and manipulation tasks can offer.",,10.22132/TEL.2014.54568,https://doi.org/10.22132/TEL.2014.54568,forward

It aims to examine the most appropriate strategies used by 2nd year students of English as compared to those of 4th year when refusing their interlocutors' invitation, suggestion, and offer. WDCT questionnaire was used to collect data from 40 Iraqi undergraduate students of English: 20 2nd year and 20 4th year. Adopting Beebe et al.'s (1990) theory of refusal, data collected was analyzed quantitatively using statistical analysis. The findings revealed that the 2nd year students of English were more frequent in using direct refusals than their 4th year counterparts. This means the latter were more aware of using refusals politely than the former. On the other hand, the findings showed that 4th year students more frequent in their use of indirect refusal strategies that the 2nd year students. This indicates that the EFL learners of low proficiency level might not bridge the gap between the pragmalinguistic strategies and the grammatical form of the target language. This means that they were not pragmatically competent of the use of the appropriate pragmalinguistic strategies. This implies that the 2nd year students need to pay more attention to pragmatics and use their refusal strategies appropriately. Thus, the paper recommends conducting further research on the use of refusal speech act in Arabic and English.",,10.14500/kujhss.v3n1y2020.pp166-173,https://doi.org/10.14500/kujhss.v3n1y2020.pp166-173,forward

For the sake of the current article, the pragmatic feature that has been chosen is the speech act of refusals. The rationale behind this selection is based on the fact that refusals are seen as a face-threatening act which may confront listeners’ expectations (Eslami 2010: 217). Hence, learners should obtain a particular pragmatic expertise to outperform refusals successfully and that is the reason why the teaching of this speech act should be integrated in foreign language settings.",,10.18172/JES.2616,https://doi.org/10.18172/JES.2616,forward

 Feedback penetrates many walks of our lives, and its importance in L2 teaching and assessment is well recognised. However, while corrective feedback and writing feedback have been the focus of much L2 research and classroom practice, there seems relatively little attention to feedback on spoken interactional skills. Concomitantly, translating research on interactional competence (IC) to classroom practice has been a glacial process. Aiming at supporting teachers in providing assessment feedback and teaching IC in the classroom, this article introduces worked examples of peer interactions as a feedback and learning resource. Adopting a procedure used in conversation analytic (CA) research, the worked examples are designed to guide learners to notice and understand IC features in context, at a less cognitively demanding pace for processing, and promote learners’ active engagement with the feedback or teaching focus. The article concludes with suggestions for teachers to develop similar resources for their local contexts.",,10.1093/elt/ccae029,https://doi.org/10.1093/elt/ccae029,forward

The aim is to understand how intercultural communication, mediated by the internet, can create compelling and sometime challenging conditions for additional language learning. For example, university students use e-mails a lot. Nonetheless, some issues, amongst which the level of formality when they address university staff, may vary, depending on their own national culture and on the training they receive on the use of this medium. As a result, intercultural clashes may occur.

Nonetheless, there remains a paucity of research exploring how language educators perceive and manifest positive emotions in the context of their teaching practices. This study endeavors to fill this gap by exploring the experiences, practices, and beliefs of language educators regarding positive emotions in effective teaching. Additionally, it seeks to elucidate the pedagogical strategies they associate with fostering conducive learning environments through the lens of Seligman's PERMA model. Employing thematic analysis of semi‐structured interviews with 60 Chinese language educators, the study uncovers key positive emotions integral to effective teaching, including passion, trust, joy, and empathy. Despite the prevalence of these positive emotions, teachers reported a diminished sense of meaning and accomplishment when instructing foreign languages in comparison to the engagement and relationship elements outlined in the PERMA model. The findings shed light on a spectrum of teaching strategies embraced by these educators that align with the components of the PERMA model. By illuminating the affective dimension of language teaching, this study not only provides valuable insights into understanding positive emotions, engagement, and relationships in language education but also offers practical implications for integrating PERMA elements into language teaching and learning practices.",,10.1111/ijal.12642,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijal.12642,forward

Caroline L. Rieger,2018.0,How (not) to be rude: Facilitatingthe acquisition of L2 (im)politeness,"Abstract This article argues for frequent targeted teaching of relational language use or (im)politeness in the L2 classroom. The approach presented here draws on authentic data in the target language and in the language of instruction, which are readily available online. It encourages the learner to make use of their multilingual resources and is exploratory in nature, allowing for a deep engagement with (im)politeness, viz., an extensive array of semiotic features invested in the co-construction of social relations in every social interaction. Working at the interface of (im)politeness studies, intercultural pragmatics, interlanguage pragmatics, and language pedagogy, and undertaken from the perspective of interpersonal pragmatics and relational work, the qualitative analysis focuses on the collaborative work products from participatory learning activities of intermediate to advanced learners of German at a large North-American university. Results show the learners’ raised awareness and broadened knowledge. In particular, learners became aware that what is judged as (im)polite is dependent on the relationship of the interactants, the gender of the interactants, the sociocultural background, norms, values, and believes of the interactants, the context of the interaction, the affiliations of the evaluator, the sociocultural background, norms, values, and believes of the evaluator, etc. Results also suggest that some of the learners need to develop their pragmalinguistic skills further to fully participate in the evaluation of pragmatically rich target language discourse. Additional studies are needed to explore the impact on the learners’ interactional competence.",,10.1515/ip-2018-0023,https://doi.org/10.1515/ip-2018-0023,forward

After the concept of pragmatic knowledge, as one component of communicative language ability, is reviewed, this article will evaluate proposed pedagogical models for the teaching of pragmatics. We will then present ways for teaching grammar as a communicative resource through a look at the pragmatic functions of grammatical expressions used to express communicative action, such as the conditional, the imperfect, tag questions, impersonal expressions, and adverbials. The importance of classroom input and the role of pragmatic variation when teaching pragmatics in the classroom are also addressed. Finally, we propose a four-step pedagogical model for the teaching of pragmatics with online activities that can be used directly in the classroom, and this article closes with a recommendation that pragmatics be integrated into the language curriculum.",,10.1353/HPN.2012.0124,https://doi.org/10.1353/HPN.2012.0124,forward

Within the context of Greek EFL education, where English is introduced at a young age, proficient Greek speakers of English often grapple with cross-cultural misunderstandings during communication. This study presents an extensive examination of the curriculum used in the initial year of Greek high school education (lyceums), with a specific focus on im-plicature. The central objective is to assess the adequacy of the instructional materials in cultivating learners’ pragmatic awareness, particularly their competence in identifying implicatures within written contexts. Notably, the analysis reveals a prevalence of non-creative implicatures, suggesting that contextual cues played a marginal role in their comprehension. Implicatures prominently featured in literary and lyrical forms, underscoring the propensity of poetic language for non-literal expression, while news articles demonstrated a predilection for literal language usage due to their objective nature. Furthermore, a limited utilization of relevant implicatures in instructional exercises is observed, with only a fraction of tasks capitalizing on this vital pragmatic facet. Specifically, among a total of 97 tasks, merely 8 exhibited partial incorporation of implicatures, representing less than 10% of the total exercise pool. The implications of these findings underscore the imperative of enhancing pragmatics instruction to better equip learners for effective cross-cultural communication.",,10.4236/ojml.2023.135038,https://doi.org/10.4236/ojml.2023.135038,forward

These sequences have been examined by many researchers to find the situation-based formulas which may help L2 learners follow a possibly more target-like speaking system. This study, therefore, explored two categories of formulaic expressions including speech formulas and situation-bound utterances used by EFL learners. The randomly selective participants included 30 intermediate and 30 advanced learners, who performed a total number of 120 role-play tasks focused on the situations which required the use of thanking, requesting, offering, and apology speech acts. Audio-recorded data from role-plays were transcribed and analyzed based on existing lists of speech formulas. Results showed that the participants produced more than 102 types of formulaic sequences that could be called “a list of pragmatic routines for thanking, requesting, offering, and apologizing speech acts in the EFL context”.  This list includes 44 and 58 speech formulas and situation-bound utterances, respectively. Results further indicated that advanced language learners used more diverse situation-bound utterances in terms of its internal and contextual complexity than their counterparts in the intermediate group due to expert judgments. Because these formulas can increase coherence in speaking, and enhance effective and natural communication, their instruction could be part of the language teaching curriculum.",,10.22099/JTLS.2019.33711.2694,https://doi.org/10.22099/JTLS.2019.33711.2694,forward

Zainab Alsuhaibani,2020.0,Developing EFL students’ pragmatic competence: The case of compliment responses,"This study investigated the effect of consciousness-raising instruction and corpus-based instruction on EFL (English as a foreign language) students’ development of compliment responses. It employed a quasi-experimental design with 136 EFL university students divided between three groups: control, consciousness-raising, and corpus groups. A discourse completion test (DCT) was used as a pre- and post-test with all the groups to investigate any significant differences between them. Further, a questionnaire with open-ended questions was used to explore students’ perceptions of pragmatic instruction of compliment responses. The results showed the effectiveness of pragmatic instruction of compliment responses through both consciousness-raising instruction and corpus- based instruction. More specifically, significant differences were found between consciousness-raising group and the corpus group on one hand, and the control group on the other. No significant differences were found between the consciousness-raising group and the corpus group. The results also revealed that the students value the importance of pragmatic instruction indicating that it was important, necessary, useful, and enjoyable at the same time. The article ends with some pedagogical recommendations for pragmatic instruction.",,10.1177/1362168820913539,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362168820913539,forward
"not yet matched, W. Ren",2020.0,Pragmatic awareness and second language learning motivation,"
 Motivation has an effect on the rate and success of second language (L2) learning. However, little is known about its role
 in students’ levels of L2 pragmatic awareness. This study investigated whether and to what extent students’ L2 motivation influences their
 pragmatic awareness. A total of 498 Chinese university students completed a two-part web-based survey (an appropriateness judgement task and
 a motivation questionnaire), of whom 12 were subsequently interviewed. The quantitative results show that pragmatic awareness correlates
 positively with attitudes towards the L2 community and the intended learning efforts. Moreover, a model combining the intended learning
 efforts, attitudes towards the L2 community and attitudes towards learning English can significantly predict pragmatic awareness. The
 analysis of semi-structured interviews reveals a mismatch between students’ immediate needs when learning English and outcomes of pragmatic
 acquisition, which may contribute to the absent correlation between overall levels of L2 motivation and pragmatic awareness.",,10.1075/pc.19022.yan,https://doi.org/10.1075/pc.19022.yan,forward

Su objetivo fue identificar las principales dificultades pragmáticas que enfrentan los estudiantes en L2 para desenvolverse en el medio académico. La metodología de esta investigación es cualitativa y se basa en el análisis de las fuentes documentales, con un diseño documental, descriptivo y transversal, sin realizar intervenciones experimentales. El principal resultado fue la identificación de tres obstáculos principales en la competencia pragmática de los estudiantes universitarios: la dificultad para adaptar el registro lingüístico a las demandas contextuales del medio académico, el desconocimiento de las normas socioculturales implícitas en el discurso académico, y la incapacidad de implementar estrategias comunicativas que permitan negociar significados, reformular ideas o resolver conflictos en debates académicos. La principal conclusión del estudio es que la falta de competencia pragmática afecta negativamente el rendimiento estudiantil, limita la participación en actividades académicas básicas y genera una percepción de falta de profesionalismo que puede llevar al aislamiento y la restricción de oportunidades de formación.",,10.56368/entrelineas326,https://doi.org/10.56368/entrelineas326,forward

Pragmatics is critical in developing learners' ability to communicate effectively in the target language. As a result, it is possible to conclude that the combination of TBLT and GBLL would be beneficial and meaningful for second language learners learning their target language. Furthermore, task-based games in language learning have the potential to motivate and engage learners in meaningful learning while promoting autonomy and reducing anxiety, particularly among second language learners. It was also discovered that digital game-based learning is more effective than non-digital game-based learning because non-digital game-based learning cannot cover all critical elements of TBLT during implementation. Therefore, this essay will explore the possibility of implying game design to TBLT classrooms to achieve students' language pragmatics. Finally, some potential shortcomings and future developments will also be mentioned.",,10.18178/ijlt.8.4.261-266,https://doi.org/10.18178/ijlt.8.4.261-266,forward

"Megan DiBartolomeo, Vanessa Elias, Daniel Jung",2019.0,Investigating the effects of pragmatic instruction: a comparison of L2 Spanish compliments and apologies during short term study-abroad,"Study abroad has been proposed as a crucial aspect to acquire pragmatics in a second language, under the assumption that learners receive more access to authentic input than is available in the classroom. Recent trends indicate a rise in the frequency of short-term study abroad programs (less than 3 months, Allen, 2010), although research has shown that learners may need closer to 9 months to approximate native-like norms without instruction (FELIX-BRASDEFER, 2004). This raises the question of how much pragmatic development can be seen in short-term programs, and how to maximize this development. The current study analyzed the development of two expressive speech acts, compliments and apologies, in students who completed a five-week study abroad program in Merida, Mexico. During the program, learners received instruction on compliments, but not apologies. Speech act data was collected via a 24-item oral discourse completion task administered at both the beginning and end of the program and was further analyzed in SPSS. Results indicate that only some learners developed their production of apologies, while almost all learners showed development in their production of compliments, operationalized by an increased repertoire of strategies available. These results suggest the need for pragmatic instruction during short-term study abroad, and question the utility of native-speaker norms to measure pragmatic development during short-term programs.",,10.15448/1984-4301.2019.4.33989,https://doi.org/10.15448/1984-4301.2019.4.33989,forward

This non-linguistic and non-verbal capacity to interact from the first day they come to life enables them to express their needs and evidence their typical development. This capacity to interact develops to include linguistic and non-linguistic use of verbal and non-verbal interaction, that is, pragmatics. Because pragmatics is heterogeneously structured of semiotic, cognitive, motor and sensory elements so it is vital to ensure successful human interaction. The other language elements (i.e., phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic) are essential inputs for this human interaction outcome (i.e., pragmatics). Accordingly, this study sought to map evidence that pragmatics can enhance children’s use of linguistic and non-linguistic capacities for interactive communication. This was addressed by conducting bibliometric and scientometric analyses of 6554 documents from Scopus, 1167 from WOS and 11,230 from Lens between 1939 and 2022. We analysed the past, present and future developments of the field of pragmatics using bibliometric and scientometric indicators. The scientometric analysis was conducted using CiteSpace 5.8.R3 and VOSviewer 1.6.18 software, which enabled the tabulation, visualisation and measurement of the impact of central influencers in the field of pragmatics. In the light of our results, pragmatics continues to expand in order to understand human interaction in a deeper way and to enhance children’s typical interactions with the environment around them. The group should also include adults or elderly people whose pragmatic language skills have been impaired due to any acquired or developmental disorder, such as a brain injury.",,10.3390/children9091318,https://doi.org/10.3390/children9091318,forward

Abigail McMeekin,2022.0,"Teaching Pragmatics and Instructed Second Language Learning: Study Abroad and Technology-Enhanced Teaching, written by Halenko, Nicola","Pragmatics is teachable and is as fundamental for communication as knowing the grammatical aspects of an L2. These principles are now widely known, but there is still a large gap to be filled in this regard, especially when it comes to foreign language teaching materials. As a way of bringing contributions to the improvement of this scenario, the study under review aimed to investigate whether there are differences, in terms of effectiveness, between explicit instruction on British English pragmatic aspects – with particular emphasis on an interactive tool named oral computeranimated production task (CAPT) as opposed to paper-based tasks – and learning purely based on the contact with the target language/culture. The research participants were mainly Chinese adults, international students at a university in the UK, and the investigated speech acts were requests and apologies, carried out within a conversational genre named institutional talk. Comprising ten chapters, the volume begins with an overall approach to the numerous themes which pervade the study. In chapter 2, the author outlines an overview of studies in L2 and SLA pragmatics, discussing both concepts and seminal works from the 1980s and 1990s, in which the idea of communicative competence had great relevance, and more recent studies, in which the notions of interactional and intercultural competence are increasingly present. There is also a section dedicated to Speech Acts Theory (Austin 1962; Searle 1969) and Politeness Theory (Brown",,10.1163/26660393-bja10055,https://doi.org/10.1163/26660393-bja10055,forward

Indeed, the idea that the specificities of multicultural crews must be taken into account as early as their training period to counterbalance communication problems onboard has been the focus of research for both maritime practitioners and language instructors. Nevertheless, integrated approaches featuring the collaboration of all relevant stakeholders are rare, and the results are not always easily transposable to practical applications.

The first one is: What patterns of pragmatic development can we observe among different pragmatic functions and attributes in a second language (L2)? The second question is: In what ways do individual differences and learning context affect the course of pragmatic development? Forty-eight Japanese college students studying English in an immersion setting in Japan participated in the study. They completed a pragmatic speaking task ( k= 12) that measured their ability to produce 2 speech acts, requests and opinions, in 2 situation types: low-imposition and high-imposition. The task was administered 3 times over 1 academic year. Gains in the appropriateness of the speech acts and fluency of production were analyzed. In addition, a subset of the participants was interviewed to seek the relationship between pragmatic gains and types of sociocultural experiences available on campus. Results revealed that appropriateness showed a profound increase for the low-imposition speech acts, but the production of high-imposition speech acts was slow developing. There was a large increase in speech rate at the initial stage for both situation types, but it showed stagnation at the later stage. Qualitative data revealed an interesting portrayal of the learners' history of participation and socialization related to pragmatic development.

"Xi Chen, Lucien Brown",2024.0,L2 Pragmatic Development in Constructing and Negotiating Contextual Meanings,"
 The way in which L2 learners construct pragmatic and social meanings, including stances and identities, is emerging as an important research concern. In this study, we explore how L2 learners develop the ability to construct and negotiate pragmatic and social meanings, with a focus on meanings manifested in specific contexts, namely, contextual meanings. Specifically, we trace the development made by a group of 30 L2 Korean learners in their understanding of the contextual meanings of Korean first-person pronouns over the provision of L1- and L2-generated input and an awareness raising activity. Our findings reveal that provision of input of the underlying stereotypical meanings facilitated learners’ (re-)construction and negotiation of contextual meanings. The learners developed from oversimplistic form-meaning connections to more context-based and internally logical interpretations of contextual meanings, constructed new contextual meanings from the input, and agentively negotiated between the input and their existing indexical systems. The findings raise important pedagogical implications, including reconsideration of the assessment of pragmatic and sociolinguistic competence.",,10.1093/applin/amae049,https://doi.org/10.1093/applin/amae049,forward

Investigations into the effectiveness of textbooks for teaching communicative skills, mirroring real-life conversations, show that English Language Teaching (ELT) textbooks often lack clear and thorough explanations of English conversational dynamics (Berry, 2000; Burns, 1998; Cane, 1998; Grant & Starks, 2001). According to the available literature on EFL/ESL textbooks, speech acts, and other pragmatic elements are largely neglected in both quality and quantity (e.g., Vellenga, 2004; Salazar Campillo, 2007; Neddar, 2010). Therefore, this study examines how textbooks cultivate pragmatic competence and evaluates the pragmatic content in EFL textbooks used in Moroccan high schools from 2006-2007. It aims to assess the depth and quality of pragmatic information covered in these textbooks. In addition to concentrating on metapragmatic details, the study discusses register, illocutionary force, politeness, appropriateness, and usage, as well as how textbook authors present speech acts. However, the study findings reveal that the selected textbooks provide insufficient pragmatic information. This underscores the necessity of supplementing EFL textbooks with more authentic materials and ample meta-pragmatic information. It is also essential to consider pragmatics during the textbook design process and enhance teachers' abilities to incorporate them into their classrooms.",,10.32996/ijahs.2024.4.2.1,https://doi.org/10.32996/ijahs.2024.4.2.1,forward

The latter entails acquiring pragmatic competence, which has proved to be very challenging for L2 learners. This is because they gain limited exposure to the use of language for real communication in an authentic social setting. Moreover, instruction has been found to influence the functional abilities in L2 as it equips the learners with the ability to produce and comprehend L2 in different situations.

People from different cultures may have different perceptions of similar social factors and interpret them differentially. These differences can lead to cross-cultural miscommunications when language users perform a given speech act such as request. Based on the request analysis categories introduced by Blum-Kulka et al. (1989b) and Schauer (2009), the present study examined Iranian EFL learners' deviations in utilizing internal and external modifications from native speakers' norms and explored how Bloom-based instruction can contribute to the acquisition of internal and external modifications. To this end, a researcher-developed Written Discourse Completion Task (WDCT) was utilized to collect data from 61 participants: a. treatment group (20), b. control group (23), and c. native speakers (18). The data were categorized based on a framework adapted from Blum-Kulka et al. (1989b) and Schauer's (2009) coding schemes for internal and external modifications. The results suggested that, in the pretest, Iranian EFL learners’ use of request modification strategies differed significantly from native speakers’ norms. It was found that that after the Bloom-based ILP instruction, the treatment group progressed towards native speakers' norms in the application of several modification strategies. These findings imply that the employment of Bloom’s Taxonomy, with specific focus on high order thinking skills in the development of pragmatics tasks and activities can help EFL learners approach native speakers’ norms.",,10.22051/LGHOR.2020.29986.1250,https://doi.org/10.22051/LGHOR.2020.29986.1250,forward

Additionally, the investigation also focused on the effect of these cognitive styles on individual differences (IDs) like proficiency, age, and gender of the participants. To this end, 80 EFL learners, studying at two English language institutes in Maybod, were selected through convenient sampling. This study was conducted in three phases by using a variety of instruments, like Oxford Quick Placement Test (OPT), Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT), and Multiple Choice Discourse Completion Tasks (MCDCTs). With respect to the GEFT, students were divided into two groups, FD/FI. The MCDCTs were administered to measure students’ pragmatic comprehension and restructuring ability of the apology situations. The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS 21 statistical software. The results revealed that FI participants outperformed the FD ones in apology contexts. Individual differences like gender and age had a significant effect on the performance of the participants in both cognitive groups. Although the proficiency level demonstrated some variations, but it did not have any statistically significant impact on the performance of the participants in these two groups. The major pedagogical implication of the present study is that when assessing the interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) of EFL learners, teachers and other teaching administrations should take not only cognitive styles but also individual differences into consideration so that they could adopt and apply teaching methods in line with the learners’ various cognitive styles.",,10.29252/IJREE.5.1.85,https://doi.org/10.29252/IJREE.5.1.85,forward

The result of the t-test and chi-square analysis proved that British and American raters differed significantly in their degree of variations and preferences of these criteria. The results further showed that EFL learners’ responses seemed unreasonable and impolite to native raters which might be due to the different cultural norms between L1 and L2 societies and consequently encourage us to be aware of the importance of teaching sociopragmatic knowledge to the EFL learners.",,10.22111/IJALS.2015.2672,https://doi.org/10.22111/IJALS.2015.2672,forward

Elicited definitions were utilized to investigate meanings that learners assigned to routines based on their PC knowledge, and examples were elicited to detect the functional use to which participants put routines in a fictitious conversation in an ASC. Proficiency bore a negligible relation to routine comprehension alongside any required context knowledge, but SA experience played a decisive role at most levels. Participants tended to offer plausible definitions of routines based on their PC knowledge instead of providing made-up examples that fit within an ASC. Plausible definition-example mappings indispensably resided in the interplay between learners’ actual situational and prior context knowledge.",,10.24205/03276716.2020.1039,https://doi.org/10.24205/03276716.2020.1039,forward

A pretest-posttest research design was adopted. The data were collected through a written discourse completion task (WDCT) with six scenarios concerning the topics of appearance, performance, and personality. The results revealed that learners who received explicit instruction dramatically decreased their use of Accept strategy and increased Combination (CB) strategy at the macro level; more specifically, a decrease in Appreciation and an increase in Accept + Accept at the micro level. The learners of the control group made little progress in their performance.

Feng Xiao,2015.0,Adult Second Language Learners' Pragmatic Development in the Study-Abroad Context: A Review.,"The ability to use language effectively in communication is regarded as important as knowledge of grammatical rules in the communicative competence models (Bachman & Palmer, 1996, 2010; Canale & Swain, 1980). Pragmatic competence, namely the ability to understand and use linguistic forms appropriately according to context, is thus accepted as a vital component of language ability (e.g., Bachman & Palmer, 1996, 2010). Recently, pragmatic competence and development have captured growing interest among L2 pragmatics research (for a review, see Kasper & Rose, 1999, 2002; Kasper & Roever, 2005; Taguchi, 2010). Specifically, a series of studies have been conducted in the study abroad (SA) context (e.g., Barron, 2003; Iwasaki, 2010; Kinginger, 2008; Matsumura, 2001, 2003; Schauer, 2006a, 2006b; Taguchi, 2008a, 2008b), because, compared to a domestic classroom setting, the SA context is believed to provide greater opportunities to communicate with native speakers, and these opportunities are assumed to lead to pragmatic gains (Kinginger, 2008, 2009). For example, expressions such as “would you+verb” and “could I +verb” are usually used to make a request, and expression like “why not+verb” and “how about +verb” are often interpreted as suggestions. This conventional language use for pragmatics is recurrent in the target-language community, providing learners more exposure to such language use and consequently, more opportunities to use such conventional pragmatic expressions in context.",,10.36366/frontiers.v25i1.349,https://doi.org/10.36366/frontiers.v25i1.349,forward

"M. Khatib, Mohammad Baqerzadeh Hosseini",2015.0,The Effect of Explicit and Implicit Instruction through Plays on EFL Learners’ Speech Act Production,"Despite the general findings that address the positive contribution of teaching pragmatic features to interlanguage pragmatic development, the question as to the most effective method is far from being resolved. Moreover, the potential of literature as a means of introducing learners into the social practices and norms of the target culture, which underlie the pragmatic competence, has not been fully explored. This study, then, set out to investigate the possible contribution of plays , as a medium of instruction, to the pragmatic development through either explicit or implicit mode of instruction. To this end, 80 English-major university students were assigned to four experimental groups: two literary and two nonliterary groups. One of the literary groups (Implicit Play) received typographically enhanced plays containing the speech acts of apology, request, and refusal and the other (Explicit Play) received the same treatment in addition to the metapragmatic instruction on the acts. The medium of instruction for the nonliterary groups were dialogs containing the given functions; they were also given either enhanced input (Implicit Dialog) or input plus metapragmatic information (Explicit Dialog). Analyses of the four groups‟ performance on a Written Discourse Completion Test (WDCT) before and after the treatment did not show any advantage for the literary The Effect of Explicit and Implicit Instruction through Plays… medium, i.e., there was no significant difference between literary and nonliterary groups. It was rather the mode of instruction that mattered most, where explicit groups outperformed their implicit counterparts. These findings indicate that even though implicit teaching, that is, exposure to enhanced input followed by some awareness-raising tasks, is effective in pragmatic development, it cannot contribute so much to learning as can the explicit instruction.",,10.18869/ACADPUB.IJAL.18.2.109,https://doi.org/10.18869/ACADPUB.IJAL.18.2.109,forward

Employing the most efficient measure of pragmatics has led many researchers to examine the existing measures to pinpoint the most useful ones. This study was an attempt to compare and contrast Written Discourse Completion Task (WDCT), Oral Discourse Completion Task (ODCT), and Role-play with Natural methodology in an EFL institutional context to see which measure approximated Natural methodology. To this end, data (requests) were collected from 27 intermediate–level Iranian EFL learners in a natural classroom institutional context over 15 weeks, and then the WDCTs, ODCTs, and Role-plays with the same contextual features were selected to elicit the intended data. The participants’ requests were transcribed and analyzed in terms of Schauer’s (2009) request head act strategy taxonomy and its internal and external modification devices. The results of Binominal tests indicated that, in spite of some minor similarities, none of the elicitation measures could approximate the natural data. The participants’ employment of direct, non-conventionally indirect request strategies, and internal and external modification devices were more conspicuous in the WDCTs, ODCTs, and Role-plays than those in the Natural methodology. The study implies that data collection methods should be selected based on researchers’ objectives and research questions.",,10.1075/prag.18052.moh,https://doi.org/10.1075/prag.18052.moh,forward

G. C. Lin,2007.0,The Significance of Pragmatics.,"The education of pragmatics is necessary and important in our globalized world. The reason is that English is currently used by people in the world for interaction and communication with each other in order to do international trade or participate in the academic conferences (McKay, 2002). For avoiding miscommunication caused by cultural difference, being familiar with diverse cultures and pragmatics is essential. Studies of Pragmatics emphasize the appropriateness in inter-cultural discourses. Through learning pragmatics, the English speakers' intercultural communication competence should be raised. Their Pragmatic Competence would be better because of knowing cultural differences and being aware of the significance in appropriate languages. In other words, the teaching and learning of pragmatics would release the difficulties of international communications for both native and non-native speakers.",,10.6953/MJ.200712.0091,https://doi.org/10.6953/MJ.200712.0091,forward
Ying Zhang,2020.0,The Effect of Combining Computer-Mediated Communication with Instruction on EFL Learners' Pragmatic Competence,"In the field of computer-mediated communication (CMC), while many studies have focused on utilising various CMC-based tools (e.g. email, video conferencing and virtual worlds) to promote second language (L2) learning, scant attention has been paid to the crucial role of instruction. To enhance EFL learners’ competence, this mixed-methods study investigates the effectiveness of CMC on EFL learners’ competence in two settings: CMC-facilitated interaction alone and CMC-facilitated interaction combined with instruction. Fifty-three university-level Chinese EFL students took part in the study. The treatment group had CMC-based interaction with native speakers through instant messaging over the messaging software Skype and received two sessions of instruction in the targeted feature: the speech act of compliment responses (CRs), whereas the control group had CMCbased interaction without any instructional intervention. The result from an independent samples t-test on the post-intervention mean scores indicated a significant difference between groups for appropriately using CRs, favouring the treatment group (p = .011). In addition, qualitative data were gathered via semi-structured interviews to further interpret the quantitative data and unearth factors that would influence L2 learners’ behaviours. Three main themes were derived based on the thematic analysis, encompassing learners’ L2 pragmatic knowledge, the influence of first language on L2, and their English-learning experience. These findings provide further insight into the positive impact of combining CMC with instruction on EFL learners’ competence. Pedagogical implications for adopting the integration between CMC-based interaction and instruction in L2 pragmatics are discussed.",,10.46451//ijts.2020.12.06,https://doi.org/10.46451//ijts.2020.12.06,forward
"Dale A. Koike, Denise T. L. Palmiere",2011.0,First and Second Language Pragmatics in Third Language Oral and Written Modalities,"Abstract: This study examines the transfer of first language (L1) and second language (L2) pragmatic expression-realized in the request speech act-in oral and written modalities by Spanish-speaking third language (L3) Portuguese learners (bilingual Spanish heritage speakers, native English speakers who are proficient in L2 Spanish, and native Spanish speakers). Research questions ask if learners differ in the transfer of pragmatic knowledge from the L1 or L2 in an oral versus written modality, and if the three learner groups differ in pragmatic expression in the two modalities. Results indicate that the groups respond differently in the two modalities, showing sensitivity to contextual constraints. Few instances of clear transfer are seen, mostly from Spanish at the single-word level. A picture more complex than Kellerman's hypothesis emerges, addressing creative L3 pragmatic and lexical construction. Key words: Portuguese, L3 pragmatic expression of requests, multilingualism, pragmatic transfer, Spanish-speaking L3 Portuguese learners, speech acts Introduction In the learning of a second language (L2), the transfer of knowledge from the adult learner's first language (L1) to an L2 is a process that frequently occurs, as has been demonstrated in several studies on language transfer (Kecskes & Papp, 2000; Odlin, 1989). Transfer, however, has been found to be a complex process. For example, Kellerman (1983) noted the importance of the learner's perception of the typological distance between the L1 and the target language (TL). Learners who know L1 or L2 Spanish undoubtedly perceive a similarity between languages as they learn Portuguese as a third language (L3), because the two languages share many linguistic features and lexical items. One must also consider other factors, such as the learner's tendency to transfer certain linguistic elements of the L1 or L2 grammar and lexicon (e.g., see Cenoz, 2001, for the transfer of content vs. function words), or prepositions and articles as opposed to other grammatical types (Ringbom, 1987, 2001). Koike and Flanzer (2004) examined this question of transfer in the context of L3 Portuguese pragmatic expressions by various categories of Spanish speakers who were beginners in Portuguese learning in order to investigate whether bilingual Spanish-English heritage speakers differ from native English speakers who know L2 Spanish well in their realization of speech acts in L3 Portuguese. They also attempted to discover if these Portuguese learners seemed to transfer from one language in particular, and if they could draw any implications for teaching from such findings. We describe their findings in more detail later on, as they form a point of departure for the present study. In summary, Koike and Flanzer found differences in the written pragmatic production of requests and apologies between bilingual Spanish heritage speakers and native English speakers who know L2 Spanish well in their realization of speech acts in L3 Portuguese. The differences were not substantive, yet the ones that were seen indicated that, in several aspects, the speech acts used by the informants reflected different patterns of pragmatic transfer, illustrating the influence of their base languages. The present study examines the transfer of L1 and L2 pragmatic expressionF realized in the speech act of requestsFin the oral modality by beginning L3 Portuguese learners and compares these findings to data analyzed from the written modality seen in Koike and Flanzer (2004). Others have noted differences in learner production between oral and written contexts (Beebe & Cummings, 1996; Safont Jorda` , 2005), so a comparative study is warranted here. In addition, we target beginning learners because, as noted by Kasper and Rose (1999), there are few studies that investigate pragmatic production at this level of learning. Unlike the Koike and Flanzer (2004) study, in which there were two groups of learners, the participants in the current investigation comprise three groups typical of Portuguese language instruction in the United States: bilingual Spanish heritage speakers (NSH), native English speakers as proficient intermediate and advanced L2 Spanish speakers (NES),1 and native Spanish speakers (NSS). …",,10.1111/J.1944-9720.2011.01115.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1944-9720.2011.01115.X,forward

"Z. Tajeddin, Ali Malmir",2015.0,The Construct of Interlanguage Pragmatic Learning Strategies: Investigating Preferences of High vs. Low Pragmatic Performers,"Interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) has witnessed a growing body of research in the past two decades. One of the under-explored domains of L2 pragmatics is the role of learning strategies specifically tailored for the development of ILP knowledge. Therefore, this investigation aimed to determine the significant interlanguage pragmatic learning strategies (IPLS) used by high vs. low L2 pragmatic achievers. It was conducted in two phases. First, a multiple-choice discourse completion test including five common English speech acts was administered to 500 EFL learners. Next, 80 highest and 80 lowest ILP performers were orally interviewed and their answers were audio-taped. The most important interlanguage pragmatic learning strategies were extracted from L2 learners' interviews. The elicited IPLS were arranged based on Cohen's (2005, 2010) classification, the findings of the study itself, and an analogy with general language learning strategies (LLS) classification suggested by Oxford (1990). The extracted IPLS were divided into six categories of memory-related, cognitive, social, affective, metacognitive and compensatory IPLS. The high ILP performers used more strategies in all the six categories. The main conclusion of this study is that the use of more IPLS means a better ILP knowledge of speech acts. The most significant implication of the current study was that ILPS need to be taught to L2 learners to enhance their ILP knowledge in general and their speech-act-specific competence in particular.",,10.22099/JTLS.2015.3016,https://doi.org/10.22099/JTLS.2015.3016,forward

As a language learner, being able to use different modes of communication for remote participation, understanding authentic electronic discourses, and engaging in digital communities are essential for success in our technology-saturated world. Thus, expanding one’s language repertoire to adapt to a multiplicity of communicative contexts is fundamental. Participating in a multilingual world is usually understood as being able to speak a language (i.e., having language fluency, and sometimes accuracy as well as complexity). We know, however, that being a competent speaker of a language involves more than being fluent. As González-Lloret (2019) points out, a capable speaker needs to engage in appropriate language use to effectively accomplish any communicative act. A speaker that is grammatically competent but inappropriate will be regarded as impolite or unfriendly (Thomas, 1983). This may have critical consequences, especially in high-stakes situations such as business interactions, formal introductions, and work interviews. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of human interaction requires speakers and listeners to shift their language use as the context, mood, or expectations of their interlocutor(s) change, making it a Editorial",,10.1558/cj.40433,https://doi.org/10.1558/cj.40433,forward

It also explores the effect of symmetrical and asymmetrical proficiency pairings during the participants' collaborative dialogue on the production of speech acts. To this end, three intermediate-level intact classes were randomly assigned to the teacher's scaffolding (TS), peers' collaborative dialogue (PCD), and control groups. The PCD group was also divided into symmetrical and asymmetrical pairs based on their pragmatic pretest scores. The treatment lasted for 11 sessions. Each session involved the metapragmatic instruction followed by pragmatic problem-solving tasks, with the TS group getting the teacher's scaffolding and the PCD group collaborating in pairs while doing the tasks. The ANOVA and independent samples t-test results of the post-test scores revealed the superiority of the PCD group over the TS group. Asymmetrical pairs were also found to outperform their symmetrical counterparts.

This study examined the effectiveness of explicit teaching of hedging for Thai EFL health science undergraduates in a leading university in Bangkok, Thailand, in terms of awareness of the need for hedging and ability to accurately hedge. The data were common lexical hedges found in a pretest, posttest and the discussion section of student research articles. These hedges were analyzed and compared in terms of frequency, variety, use in context and appropriateness of use. A questionnaire was also used to obtain data on learner’s perceptions of the direct instruction of hedging and positive results were found. Learners’ awareness of the need for hedging was evident in the higher frequencies of hedges found in the posttest and discussion corpora. Their ability to hedge was somewhat improved, which could be seen in the greater variety of hedges used in appropriate contexts after the direct instruction.

"Rina Evianty, Risnovita Sari, Muhammad Reza",2020.0,Developing Student’s German Language Competencies through Pragmatic Approach in the Classroom for Higher Education,"The general goal of teaching German as a foreign language is that learners can communicate appropriately in writing and orally in German. But in fact this goal can often not be achieved. Many learners in higher education master the German grammar and vocabulary, but they are unable to use German language that matches the social context, because they do not have much pragmatics competence. Pragmatic approach based on the function of language as a communication tool is a study of language by involving various aspects outside the language that are able to provide meaning. Pragmatic competence constitutes a significant factor in determining the success of communication.  In fact, a German language learner in higher education is not only expected to use language and produce utterances which are understandable or grammatically correct, but is also expected to produce utterances which are socioculturally appropriate. However, for students in higher education who learn German as a Foreign Language (Deutsch als Fremdsprache/DaF), the pragmatic competence, which can actually be acquired naturally through social interaction, is quite difficult to acquire due to the limited. On this basis, pragmatics needs to be integrated into German language courses in higher education, which includes pragma linguistics and socio pragmatic. In this regard, this study describes not only the relationship between pragmatics and German as a foreign language, but also this study is an attempt to define its implications in teaching German as foreign language in higher education.",,10.33258/BIRLE.V3I1.853,https://doi.org/10.33258/BIRLE.V3I1.853,forward

Each participant interacted with a native speaker interlocutor who assumed different roles in those scenarios. Baseline data were provided by 10 native speakers (NSs) of Chinese. A total of 102 role-plays were coded for request strategies, internal modifications, and supportive moves, as well as the sequential placement of supportive moves in pre-, insert, and postexpansions. Situational variations as reflected in role-play production were considered alongside. The results showed that learners across proficiencies had the same range of pragmatic strategies as in NSs' repertoire, but they showed a general incompetence in employing internal modifications. Learners' ability to delay the requests improved with increasing proficiency, but learner production in general did not show the same level of situational variations as observed in the NS data.",,10.1111/FLAN.12263,https://doi.org/10.1111/FLAN.12263,forward

N. Alsmari,2020.0,The Effect of Flipped Classroom Instruction on Developing Saudi EFL Learners’ Comprehension of Conversational Implicatures,"While pragmatic instruction has received considerable attention from researchers of interlanguage pragmatics over the last three decades, its effective implementation in the EFL classroom remains an unresolved question. The flipped classroom model is a recently developed teaching method that constitutes a role change for teachers and learners, inverting the front-of-class instruction paradigm in favor of active and collaborative classroom learning. To potentially take advantage of this promising trend, the present study seeks to explore the effectiveness of the flipped classroom for developing Saudi EFL undergraduates’ pragmatic competence and language proficiency by focusing on the comprehension of conversational implicatures during one academic semester. A total of 100 students, assigned to flipped teaching group (n=50) and traditional teaching group (n=50), participated in the study. To elicit the required data, the Oxford Placement Test, a discourse completion test, and reflective e-portfolios were used. A post-test revealed that pragmatic competence significantly increased in the case of the flipped group. The mean score of the flipped group (M=18.48) was considerably higher than that of the traditional group (M=14.68). In following the flipped model of instruction, this progress was influenced by effective out-of-class preparation and appropriate manipulation of in-class time.",,10.5539/ijel.v10n2p107,https://doi.org/10.5539/ijel.v10n2p107,forward

Drawing on Herbert’s (1986), Mile (1994), Rose and Kwai-Fun (2001), and also the data of the current study, 18 types of compliment responses were identified. Based on different compliment topics [such as appearance, ability, possession and nationality], the researcher along with 12 others as assistants who were instructed how to give compliments got engaged in conversations with different people to compliment them. They complimented people from various professions, contexts, cities and educational levels. The majority [67.6%] of our corpus of 756 naturally occurring compliment responses fell into the main category of “agreement”. However, the absence of the compliment response “no-acknowledgement ”, the high rate of two or three part appreciation token along with a significant portion of “ making offer” attest to the culturally-specific Iranian features such as modesty and Ta’arof. Additionally, no significant differences were found between males and females in terms of compliment response types, or the degree of modesty or Ta’arof. Nonetheless, there existed significant differences with regard to topics of compliment in a sense that most of the compliments given on nationality (89%) were accepted while in the case of physical and mental domain, it was not that much high. Like other studies in pragmatic area, this study also indicates that compliment response is cross-naturally varied, different, and hence warrants more attention in instruction and material development.",,10.7575/IJALEL.V.2N.1P.44,https://doi.org/10.7575/IJALEL.V.2N.1P.44,forward

Applications allowing a learner to have a conversation in a foreign language with a computer have been studied from various perspectives and under different names (dialogue systems, conversational agents, chatbots…). Considering the fragmentation of what we identify under the term dialogue-based CALL, we attempt to offer a structured overview of these efforts into a conceptual framework. Through a methodical search strategy, we collected a corpus of 343 publications. From this corpus, we formalized an operational definition of dialogue-based CALL, which allowed us to identify 96 relevant systems. Analyzing the type of dialogue they offer, on a continuum of constraints on form and meaning, we propose to classify those systems into four groups. We have called these branching, form-focused, goal-oriented and reactive systems, and we describe their corresponding interactional, instructional and technological traits. We summarize the main results from empirical studies on such systems, distinguishing observational, survey and experimental studies, and discuss the impact of dialogue-based CALL on motivation and L2 development, identifying positive evidence on both outcomes. Finally, we propose two main avenues for future research: relative effectiveness of dialogue-based CALL approaches, and dialogue systems as an environment for testing SLA hypotheses.",,10.1080/09588221.2018.1535508,https://doi.org/10.1080/09588221.2018.1535508,forward

This lack of adequate research also stands true for the underlying pragmatic comprehension processes and strategies. Therefore, the present investigation aimed to find out L2 pragmatic comprehension strategies used by 40 (F=20, M=20) Iranian EFL learners and to discover whether there would be any differences between interlanguage pragmatic comprehension strategies used by male and female learners. Participants, selected based on stratified random sampling, were chosen on the basis of their performance on a paper-based TOEFL out of the initial sample of 90 students. Three data collection instruments were employed: a validated pragmatic test (Tajeddin & Ahmadi Safa, 2010), concurrent verbal think-aloud protocols, and retrospective verbal think-aloud protocols. Data analysis revealed three classes of pragmatic comprehension strategies. First, socio- pragmatic strategies that included politeness, formality, indirectness, and distance/power influences. Second, lexico-pragmatic strategies which were more frequent than grammatical strategies in the second category. Third, the cognitive strategies that comprised both top-down and bottom-up processing strategies in L2 pragmatic comprehension. Furthermore, it was found that gender did not play any significant role in the use of pragmatic comprehension strategies. Study findings suggest that explicit teaching of pragmatic comprehension strategies helps learners promote their L2 pragmatic comprehension.",,10.30466/IJLTR.2020.120805,https://doi.org/10.30466/IJLTR.2020.120805,forward

The present meta-analysis aims not only to provide a quantitative and reliable measure of the effects of instruction for the speech act of request in Iran, but also to illustrate a description of the relationship between some variables that moderate its effectiveness (age, gender, proficiency level, treatment type, research design, and data collection procedure). To do so, a total of 37 studies were retrieved and by establishing a set of different inclusion/exclusion criteria, 17 primary studies were coded and analyzed. Results revealed that (1) there is an overall large effect size on the effectiveness of the instruction of request (g = 1.48) in an Iranian context; (2) some variables were found to be a moderator for this effectiveness like gender and treatment type; (3) considering gender, the male group produced a larger effect size (g = 3.09) than the female one (g = 1.10); (4) and regarding treatment types, the explicit group yielded a larger effect size (g = 1.53) than the implicit one (g = 1.20).

As the population of CLD students who are identified both as culturally and linguistically diverse and having a specific learning disability in the area of mathematics increases, there have been increased efforts to identify strategies that support the complexity that their identities bring to mathematics instruction.

"Ali Malmir, Ali Derakhshan",2020.0,Identity Processing Styles as Predictors of L2 Pragmatic Knowledge and Performance: A Case of Common English Speech Acts,"Identity processing styles are those psychological, sociocultural, and socio-cognitive mechanisms that shape, reshape, and establish different individuals’ identities both in their mother tongues and in the second or foreign language they are striving to acquire. The relationship between these identity processing styles and L2 learners’ pragmatic competence is a crucial issue that has not been explored thus far in an EFL context. Therefore, the present study sought to investigate the relationship between the information-oriented, diffuse-avoidant, and normative identity processing styles as measured by Berzonsky’s (2011) Identity Processing Style Inventory (ISI-4) and L2 speech-act knowledge and production among 122 (82 F and 40 M) Iranian upper-intermediate to advanced proficiency level learners. A validated 35-item multiple-choice discourse completion test (MDCT) including five frequent English speech acts (requests, apologies, refusals, complaints, and compliments/compliment responses) and a related role-play interactive test were then employed. The application of multiple regression revealed that diffuse-avoidant and normative identity processing styles were significant but moderate contributors to both pragmatic knowledge and production; however, information-oriented identity processing style was a weak significant predictor. These findings imply that teachers can manage and tailor the instructional pragmatic practices in accordance with the learners’ identity processing styles.",,10.22051/LGHOR.2020.31583.1315,https://doi.org/10.22051/LGHOR.2020.31583.1315,forward

Additionally, for the sake of a qualitative study, all the dialogues between the teacher and pairs of students under investigation were audiorecorded while they were receiving the treatment. Finally, a WDCT posttest was administered to both groups. Results of the analysis of the data, using t test, showed that the G-DA group performed significantly better than the N-DA group. Also, the qualitative microgenetic analysis of the dialogues between the learners and their teacher indicated the effectiveness of concurrent G-DA in learning requests and refusals, thus corroborating the efficiency of dynamic assessment (DA) in pragmatic instruction.

This article explores some of the potential causes for the lack of implementation of pragmatics instruction in second and foreign language classrooms (Skyes, 2013) and suggests means of overcoming such challenges. Pedagogical linguistics, in the form of pedagogical pragmatics, offers insight into meeting the challenges of limited theoretical support for curricular development, lack of authentic input in teaching materials, lack of instructor knowledge, and lack of reference books and pedagogical resources for teachers. The final challenge for pedagogical linguistics and pragmatics researchers is conveying relevant research findings to teachers; means for accomplishing this are discussed in the final section of the article.",,10.1075/pl.19013.bar,https://doi.org/10.1075/pl.19013.bar,forward

The study focuses on the need to survey and discuss communicative dynamics in classroom situations and the importance of enhancing cross-cultural pragmatic competence in the English as a foreign language (EFL) context. We believe that enhancing students’ cross-cultural pragmatic competence will provide students with a sustainable learning environment, which is crucial for the quality of education. The investigation involves a mixed approach of quantitative and qualitative methods by using a questionnaire for EFL students and interview guide questions for both EFL students and teachers. For quantitative analysis, the participants involved in this research include 200 EFL students of different nationalities, and for the qualitative analysis, the participants include 10 teachers and 20 EFL students in a university in North Cyprus. The study’s findings indicate that students lack cross-cultural pragmatic knowledge and must be provided with classroom activities for social interaction and to develop explicit and implicit communicative competencies in EFL as a target language. Findings further reveal that EFL students are not endowed with cross-cultural pragmatic competence by the EFL teachers who provide little attention to pragmatic knowledge and classroom activities in the EFL context.",,10.3390/su131810346,https://doi.org/10.3390/su131810346,forward

The main objective of the study was to determine whether collaborative translation tasks, either from or to the target language, presented in a supportive expert-novice environment, might lead to more efficient learning and retention of pragmatic knowledge. For this purpose, an experimental study was designed with four experimental groups and one control group, receiving different types of treatment including CTTs, and structured input with and without explicit instruction. Three equivalent forms of discourse completion tasks (DCT) were given to 150 low-intermediate participants as a pre-test, a post-test and a two-month follow-up delayed post-test. The results of the study indicated that CTTs appeared to have enabled noticing and deeper processing of both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic knowledge and resulted in improved learning and retention of pragmatic knowledge. The results also provide positive evidence for House's (2008) hypothesis that translation has the potential to raise pragmatic and cross-cultural awareness.",,10.1080/09571736.2021.1957989,https://doi.org/10.1080/09571736.2021.1957989,forward

I transcribed role-plays of two Japanese students before and after they completed study abroad programs in the United States and Australia, carried out periodic online interviews during their stays overseas, and conducted follow-up interviews once they returned to Japan. The results show that changes in the use of expressions occurred for three reasons: 1) input-initiated changes from noticing form–meaning–function relationships, 2) instruction-initiated changes, and 3) output-initiated changes. Because some of the changes were problematic and led to misunderstandings or impoliteness, I conclude that learning from natural input alone is not sufficient to learn how to navigate between function and situation. Therefore, the results suggest that explicit feedback and instructions in classrooms are important before and during study abroad programs.

It probes behavioural differences in the genders in and between the two societies, and considers cultural differences in the expression of ARs. Using oral discourse completion tasks (DCTs), the researchers recorded and analyzed a total of 360 responses to three apology situations. The findings reveal that ARs in both languages were complex and elaborate, embodying various subsidiary speech acts and expressions. The ARs generally showed indirectness and mitigated face threats towards interlocutors. However, one striking result is that there was no marked gender difference in AR strategy either within or between languages, thus challenging a stereotype that females are more accepting and 'polite' than males (Brown, 1980; Holmes, 1995, 2008). Another surprising result was that, in a significant minority of cases, Indonesians were revealed to be more direct and face-threatening than their Australian counterparts, again confronting a stereotype of speech behaviour, in this case that Asians are more indirect and ambiguous than native English-speakers in Western cultures.",,10.1075/ARAL.36.1.04JON,https://doi.org/10.1075/ARAL.36.1.04JON,forward

Although much emphasis has been placed in Korean language learning and teaching on the importance of honorific styles, my article reveals that this at times has come at the expense of ignoring the other side of the coin: non-honorific language. Indeed, Korean language teaching materials delay the teaching of non-honorific language to intermediate level and then only deal with them in a perfunctory way. This is unfortunate as the pragmatics of non-honorific styles can be complex and learners frequently encounter these styles outside of class, even when their Korean level is rudimentary. I argue that this lack of emphasis on non-honorific language is not limited to Korean but represents a common tendency within language pedagogy to avoid language that is considered ‘casual’ or ‘impolite’. With traditional teaching materials doing a poor job at representing these facets of language use, the solution I put forward is the use of multimedia activities.

Ali Malmir,2020.0,The Effect of Interactionist vs. Interventionist Models of Dynamic Assessment on L2 Learners’ Pragmatic Comprehension Accuracy and Speed,"Various models of Dynamic Assessment (DA) have been used in L2 pragmatic instruction and have proved their significant contributions to pragmatic production; however, there is a paucity of research regarding their implementation for pragmatic comprehension. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the effects of interactionist and interventionist models of DA on the accuracy and speed of pragmatic comprehension among a convenience sample of 60 advanced EFL learners who were randomly assigned into two DA groups and a control group. A listening pragmatic comprehension test developed and validated by Garcia (2004) was used both as a pretest and as a posttest. During the 14-session treatment, the interactionist DA group received metapragmatic instruction about 28 conversations, and learners interacted with each other and the teacher. Assistance and scaffolding were continuously provided by the teacher as the more knowledgeable other (MKO) within the learners’ Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). The interventionist DA class received its treatment based on DA procedures as presented by Lantolf and Poehner (2010). However, the Non-DA group only received metapragmatic instruction about the conversations from the instructor without any DA-based intervention or interaction. Data analysis using one-way ANCOVA revealed that study groups differed in their pragmatic comprehension accuracy and speed: DA groups significantly outperformed the control group. The interventionist DA group did significantly better than the interactionist DA group for pragmatic accuracy but nor for pragmatic comprehension speed. The pedagogical implication of the study is that teachers can utilize interventionist and interactionist DA to foster learners’ pragmatic comprehension accuracy.",,10.22054/ILT.2020.53398.515,https://doi.org/10.22054/ILT.2020.53398.515,forward

Tahnee Bucher Barbosa da Silva,2012.0,Bringing Pragmatics into the ESL Classroom,"Bringing Pragmatics into the ESL Classroom Tahnee Bucher Barbosa da Silva As a result of the expanding interest in the cognitive and social dimensions of language use beyond single sentences, a great number of research studies have been conducted in order to examine nonnative speakers’ ability to use language appropriately in a social context. Recently, with a growing understanding of the key role pragmatic competence plays in second language development, researchers have also investigated the benefits of direct instruction in helping language learners become aware of the pragmatic conditions governing the uses of grammatical structures. This thesis reports on the design and administration of a study that investigated language learners’ knowledge of pragmatics and how instruction can help them develop this knowledge in an environment where English is taught as a second language. Specifically, this project had two aims: (1) to observe the relationship between language proficiency and pragmatic competence of learners of English as a Second Language (ESL), and (2) to examine whether instruction was effective in improving those learners’ pragmatic knowledge. Pragmatic competence was measured quantitatively, through discourse judgment tasks, multiple-choice discourse completion tasks (MDCTs) and written discourse completion tasks (WDCTs) in a pre-, post-, and delayed post-test, designed specifically for this study. The participants in this research, thirty-nine adult ESL learners with a range of proficiency studying in the Intensive English Program (IEP) and in a university-level English course at West Virginia University, first took a language proficiency test and a pre-test on pragmatic knowledge. The participants were then assigned into two groups, experimental and comparison. The experimental group received four hours of direct instruction in five types of speech acts (requests, refusals, apologies, compliments, suggestions) and other aspects of pragmatic knowledge over a period of two weeks, while the comparison group was taught lessons on other topics without intervention during the same amount of time. An immediate post-test on pragmatic knowledge and a delayed post-test were given to both groups. The results showed that language proficiency and pragmatic knowledge were positively correlated with a moderate strength (r = .71, p < .001). Analysis of covariance and further analysis showed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the comparison group in both the post-test and delayed post-test. The experimental group benefited from the instruction, which used a blended methodological approach, and the instructional effect was retained after a one-week delay. The results of this research helped understand the communicative skills and intercultural competence of ESL learners and demonstrated that instruction in the area of pragmatics is not only important but it can be beneficial at all levels of language proficiency. It is hoped that the topics reported and discussed here and the findings may help both English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and ESL teachers gain a better understanding of second language learners’ pragmatic competence and development through instruction, so that when they incorporate pragmatics instruction into their teaching, they will be in a better position to adapt their practices to facilitate pragmatic development.",,10.33915/etd.316,https://doi.org/10.33915/etd.316,forward

 intermediate Vietnamese university learners of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) (N = 122) in the context of
 explicit pragmatic instruction. The control and four treatment groups received six hours of explicit instruction on English

 tasks (JT), and journals from the learners after each session. The results demonstrate that all five groups significantly improved
 their posttest performance in both the JT and RP, and these gains were retained by the time of the delayed posttest, but there
 were no statistically significant differences among the groups. However, Cohen’s d effect sizes indicate that
 metalinguistic clues produced the largest gains in the learners’ pragmatic recognition and production, while recasts produced the
 smallest gains for pragmatic recognition but a similar effect to metalinguistic clues for pragmatic production. The results
 suggest that teachers should be judicious in selecting the OCF type that suits their instructional goal and task.",,10.1075/ap.21007.pha,https://doi.org/10.1075/ap.21007.pha,forward

Jeremy W.

To this end, students at a Midwestern college engaged in live video chat pre-test conversations in Spanish in which a native speaker was instructed to compliment the student as to naturally assess the response. The student was not aware that s/he would be complimented; as such, this tool may be the most authentic way to assess student pragmatic proficiency within a classroom setting. For comparison purposes, a multiple choice test was also administered. After the pretests, pragmatic interventions on compliment sequences were presented in class, followed by a repeat of the pretests (now posttests). Growth between the tests was the main focus of the data analysis process. Statistical and anecdotal results indicate that the pragmatic lessons greatly increased the students’ ability to recognise appropriate compliment sequences in Spanish, but not to produce them. While these findings are not groundbreaking, the innovative nature of the assessment method used should encourage future researchers to use similar assessment techniques for measuring pragmatic proficiency.",,10.1080/09571736.2019.1709887,https://doi.org/10.1080/09571736.2019.1709887,forward

More specifically, it aims at exploring whether L2 proficiency can have an impact on the strategies that L2 learners use in order to express the speech act of thanking in L2 Greek. Participants were thirty-one (N=31) learners of Greek at different proficiency levels (from A2 to C2) who were enrolled in a summer intensive course of Greek at a university language school in Athens, Greece. Additionally, a group of native speakers of Greek has been included as a baseline (N=30). Oral data were elicited through a series of open role plays which represented various communicative situations with different social parameters. Furthermore, a retrospective verbal protocol has been used in order to gain more insights into the way L2 learners perform the speech act of thanking. Results showed that there is a difference in the number of strategies of L2 learners across the different proficiency levels, which is more evident between beginners and advanced learners. However, findings seem to suggest that the role of proficiency is not clear-cut and it also depends, firstly, on the social parameters of each communicative situation and also on learners’ familiarization with each situation.

This study examined the defossilizing effect of corpus-driven activities on 10 situationally-based pragmatic routines under two instructional conditions, i.e. input-based and output-based treatments. Participants were 33 advanced EFL learners in two classes in a private English language center. They received instruction in four sessions across two weeks. Before and after the treatment, a WDCT was administered for pretest and posttest purposes. The results of paired-samples and Independent Samples t-tests showed that input-enhancement and output-based instructions were effective in defossilization pragmatic routines which had a strong fossilization tendency among learners. Both treatment tasks led to significant increases in learners’ comprehension and production of the routines. The output-based group; however, significantly outperformed the input-based group in the production of the routines. The findings indicate that pragmatic instruction can debilitate the fossilization tendencies of pragmatic routines and that different instructional tasks have differential effects on the production and comprehension of pragmatic routines. The pedagogical implication of this study is that a combination of instructionally supported corpus-based tasks would be effective for enhancing EFL learners’ ability to comprehend and use routines appropriately in context.",,10.30479/JMRELS.2019.10523.1317,https://doi.org/10.30479/JMRELS.2019.10523.1317,forward

The results of the content analysis of raters‟ comments revealed nine criteria that they considered in their assessment. Moreover, the result of  the  t-test  and  chi-square analyses of raters‟ rating scores and criteria proved that there are significant differences between native and non-native EFL teachers‟ rating pattern. The results of this study also shed light on importance of sociopragmatic and pragmalinguistic features in native  and  non-native teachers‟ pragmatic rating, which can have several implications for L2 teachers, learners, and material developers. معیارهای معلمان زبان بومی و غیربومی در نمره دهی کنش کلامی درخواست : مورد معلمان انگلیسی زبان آمریکایی و ایرانی چکیده: طی چند دهه اخیر،  جنبه های  متفاوتی از دانش منظور شناختی  و تاثیر آن بر آموزش و فراگیری زبان دوم در تحقیقات متعدد مورد بررسی قرار گرفته است. با این حال، در میان تحقیقات مختلف، ارزیابی منظور شناختی بینازبانی تقریبا یک موضوع جدید محسوب می شود و بسیاری از جنبه های آن مورد بررسی قرار نگرفته است. به دلیل اهمیت زیادی که اخیرا ارزیابی منظور شناختی بینازبانی پیدا کرده است، ضرورت بررسی معیارهای سنجش معلمان انگلیسی بومی و غیربومی در نمره دهی کنش های کلامی آشکار گشته است. در این زمینه، تحقیق حاضر با هدف بررسی معیارها و نمره های داده شده توسط معلمان انگلیسی  بومی و غیربومی در ارزیابی کنش کلامی درخواست صورت پذیرفته است.  بدین منظور، 50 معلم انگلیسی زبان آمریکایی و 50 معلم انگلیسی زبان ایرانی برای ارزیابی مجموعه موقعیت آزمون تکمیل گفتمان زبان آموزان ایرانی مشارکت کردند. معلمان می بایست پاسخ های داده شده توسط زبان آموزان را نمره داده و معیار هایی که  برای ارزیابی در نظر گرفته بودند، ذکر می کردند. در نتیجه ی تحلیل محتوای نظرات معلمان،9 معیار که معلمان در ارزیابی زبان آموزان در نظر گرفته بودند مشخص شد. علاوه بر این، نتیجه ی آزمون تی و مربع خی نمرات داده شده و معیارهای ذکر شده معلمان نشان داد که تفاوت معناداری بین روش های نمره دهی معلمان بومی و غیر بومی وجود دارد. همچنین نتایج به دست آمده از این مطالعه  اهمیت ویژگی هایمنظور-جامعه شناختی و زبان-منظورشناختی را در ارزیابی منظور شناختی معلمان بومی و غیربومی مشخص کرده می تواند کاربرد گوناگونی برای معلمان زبان دوم،  دانش آموزان، و طراحان کتاب های درسی داشته باشد. کلید واژه ها: نمره دهی منظور شناختی بین زبانی، ملاک نمره دهی،  در خواست، آزمون موقعیت تکمیل گفتمان",,10.22108/ARE.2017.21326,https://doi.org/10.22108/ARE.2017.21326,forward

According to Taguchi (2005), these implicatures differ in the degrees of conventionality involved in producing them, hence requiring different degrees of processing effort on the learner’s part. Our second aim, therefore, is to examine which implicature type is more teachable. Two upper-intermediate classes of EFL learners were randomly assigned to the control and treatment conditions. The treatment group received meta-pragmatic instruction on the target implicatures and inferencing strategies while the control group followed a regular syllabus. The learning outcomes were measured by means of two parallel pragmatic listening tests before and after the study. An interview with eight learners was also conducted at the end of the study to examine the learners’ use of inferencing strategies. Results of the pragmatic listening tests suggested that while learners improved their comprehension of both types of implicatures, instruction produced a larger effect on indirect refusals. Findings from the interview also revealed more effective use of inferencing strategies by the learners after the treatment. The findings are discussed with implications for instruction in and research on pragmatic comprehension.",,10.1080/09571736.2022.2088443,https://doi.org/10.1080/09571736.2022.2088443,forward

Three sub-corpora representing three different periods of Chinese EFL learners’ performance were selected from the SECCL (Spoken English Corpus of Chinese Learners) to discover the changes in the use of linguistic formulae as well as suggestion strategies by Chinese EFL learners. Their performance was then compared with that of native English speakers to find out whether there was evidence of improvement across the years. The results show that (1) changes were taking place in the use of linguistic formulae and suggestion strategies by Chinese learners from 1997 to 2003, with greater changes taking place from the year 2000 to 2003, and (2) there was evidence of increasing similarity between Chinese learners’ performance of the suggestion speech acts and that of native English speakers. It can thus be concluded that Chinese learners’ pragmatic ability in English improved to some extent over the years of the study.",,10.5539/ELT.V7N4P147,https://doi.org/10.5539/ELT.V7N4P147,forward

"Afroozeh Heidari, Hossein Heidari Tabrizi, Azizeh Chalak",2020.0,Using short stories vs. video clips to improve upper intermediate EFL students’ sociopragmatic knowledge: Speech acts in focus,"Abstract To formulate appropriate speech acts necessitates the use of specific pragmatic and sociolinguistic skills which play a pivotal role in the knowledge of scripts and patterns of communicative events. Such an ability is influenced by the contextual and social variables that determine the linguistic resources required for choosing particular types of speech acts. Framed in speech act and sociopragmatic theories, this study sought to investigate the effect of using short stories vs. Video clips on the improvement of foreign language students’ oral production of English speech acts. To this end, from the target sample of students learning English at Isfahan University Language Center, those at the upper intermediate level were selected using a Quick Oxford Placement Test (QOPT). At the next step, the samples were randomly divided into three groups, twenty-five each and then they were assigned to one control and two experimental groups. The treatment included direct instruction of most commonly used speech acts across different cultures including disagreement, request, refusal, apology, and thanking through the application of carefully chosen short stories and video clips. While one of the experimental groups received their instruction through short stories, the other was exposed to video clips. Before and after the treatment, Two Discourse Completion Tests (DCT) were used as pre and posttests whereby the participants were encouraged to produce the targeted speech acts in specific but contrived real life contexts. The quantitative analyses of the data revealed that the students in the treatment groups significantly outperformed those of the control group in producing the target speech acts orally. Moreover, the students exposed to video mediated instruction displayed better oral production of speech acts than those receiving their instruction through short stories. Notably, the findings could offer practical benefits to those language teachers and curriculum developers who are concerned with finding the best ways of raising language learners’ consciousness about sociopragmatic related issues.",,10.1080/23311983.2020.1778977,https://doi.org/10.1080/23311983.2020.1778977,forward

Although SA online has many merits toward sustainable international education in the post-COVID era, assuring the quality of these programs and sustaining students’ learning motivation have been key issues of concern. Moreover, there is still a lack of evidence derived from in-depth qualitative inquiries. To address these gaps, this study takes a close look at an individual’s story using a narrative approach to data analysis and employs an ecological perspective focusing on intentionality as the theoretical framework for exploring how the participant conquered the challenges when they transitioned to SA online. Successful plots identified include setting up the online learning environment, optimising the benefits of online learning, and sustaining students’ motivation to study. Several obstacles remained unsolved, such as the loss of interpersonal connection and empathy in online communication. This study concludes that the participant’s successful and unsuccessful encounters in enacting the affordances of online education were manifested by developed or undeveloped intentional actions as a result of individual-environment mutuality. Some implications are offered for constructing sustainable online SA environments that can diversify and innovate future international education experiences.",,10.3390/su142316037,https://doi.org/10.3390/su142316037,forward

Chi si occupa di educazione linguistica e spesso insoddisfatto del livello di competenza d’uso dei propri apprendenti, italiani e non. Poiche gli approcci tradizionali basati sull’insegnamento di lessico e grammatica non sempre garantiscono lo sviluppo delle abilita d’uso della lingua italiana, diventa essenziale trovare nuove strade per far spazio in classe anche a interventi mirati allo sviluppo della competenza pragmatica, ossia di tutte quelle abilita che mettono gli apprendenti nelle condizioni di usare in modo adeguato la lingua nelle diverse situazioni. Il presente articolo illustra il progetto di formazione e ricerca-azione Oggi facciamo pragmatica , un primo tentativo di dare risposta a questo bisogno educativo nella scuola primaria, accompagnando i docenti di area linguistica nella riflessione sull’importanza della competenza d’uso della lingua, nell’elaborazione e nella sperimentazione di materiali didattici per il suo insegnamento in classe. Doing pragmatics: a teacher training course and an educational research project for primary school The development of linguistic competence in Italian L1 and L2 is a highly discussed topic in mainstream education today. Teachers who work in the field of linguistic education are often unsatisfied with their students’ ability to use language in different contexts. As traditional approaches based on lexis and grammar teaching do not always guarantee a good level of language performance, in mainstream classrooms it is essential to explore new ways to foster the development of pragmatic competence, namely all those abilities which enable learners to use language appropriately in different situational contexts. This paper presents the teacher training course and educational research project Doing pragmatics , a first attempt to address this educational need in primary school, guiding teachers through the analyses of the importance of pragmatic competence, the preparation and the use of original teaching materials tailored to their teaching context.",,10.13130/2037-3597/8187,https://doi.org/10.13130/2037-3597/8187,forward

"Hossein Ahmadi, F. Ghaemi",2017.0,Effects of Task Repetition and EFL Proficiency on English Speech Act Production,"Interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) studies substantiate the teachability of some aspects of second language (L2) pragmatics. However, there are controversies over the most effective instructional methods. Therefore, following a comparison group design, the present study aims to investigate the relative efficacy of two conditions of output-production task repetition on high- and low-level English as a foreign language (EFL) learners’ production of speech acts. The main effects of the instructional conditions, EFL proficiency level, and the potential interaction between them are examined. Two classes of English-major students take speech act lessons involving output-generation task repetition as follows: (1) the implicit task-repetition (ITR) group is provided with visually enhanced input plus a consciousness raising task before repeating the output-generation tasks, and (2) the explicit task-repetition (ETR) group is provided with input plus metapragmatic information before repeating the output-generation tasks. The learners’ speech act production is assessed through a written discourse completion test (WDCT) across a pretest and a posttest. The results demonstrate significant gains for both groups from the pretest to the posttest. Moreover, the ETR group significantly outperforms the ITR group in the posttest. Furthermore, EFL proficiency level is found to have a significant effect on learners’ speech act production, with high-level learners outperforming low-level learners. The results reveal no significant interaction between the effects of instructional condition and EFL proficiency level. Regarding pedagogical implications, the findings attest the efficacy of output-generation task repetition in L2 speech acts instruction, particularly when task repetition is coupled with explicit instruction.",,10.2139/SSRN.2945900,https://doi.org/10.2139/SSRN.2945900,forward

The sample involved 96 BA and MA Persian students and 10 native speakers of English. A Discourse Completion Test (DCT) was used to generate data related to the request strategies used by each group. Selection of request situations in DCT was based on two social factors of relative power and social distance. Although results revealed pragmatic development, particularly in the movement from direct to conventionally indirect strategies on the part of EFL learners, learners with higher proficiency displayed overuse of indirect type of requesting; whereas the native group was characterized by the more balanced use of this strategy. The lower proficiency learners, on the other hand, overused the most direct strategy type. In terms of the influence of the social variables, the findings of this research revealed that as far as social power is concerned EFL learners display closer performance to native speakers. But considering social distance, it seems that Iranian EFL learners have not acquired sufficient sociopragmatic knowledge to display proper social behavior.",,10.5539/ELT.V2N1P46,https://doi.org/10.5539/ELT.V2N1P46,forward
"Hossein Ahmadi, F. Ghaemi, P.

Three intact classes of English-major students constituted three instructional groups: (1) the explicit task-repetition (ETR) group, (2) the implicit task-repetition (ITR) group, and (3) the no-input task repetition (NTR) group. All the three groups engaged in the repetition of outputgeneration tasks. However, before the second performance of the task, the ETR group received input coupled with metapragmatic information, the ITR group received visually enhanced input coupled with a consciousness raising task, and the NTR group received no input. The results of a written discourse completion test (WDCT) revealed statistically significant gains in the learners’ performance from the pretest to the posttest in the ETR and ITR groups, but not in the NTR group. Moreover, the analysis of differences across the groups in the posttest revealed the superiority of the ETR over the ITR and NTR groups. The results suggest that output-based task repetition cannot enhance EFL learners’ speech act production ability unless learners are provided with input before the second performance of the task. Also when explicit and implicit instructional methods are integrated with output-based task repetition, the explicit approach is more effective than its implicit counterpart.",,10.29252/IJAL.19.2.1,https://doi.org/10.29252/IJAL.19.2.1,forward
Mansooreh Dashti Khavidaki,2023.0,The Interplay of Contextual Variables and Language Proficiency in Request Realization,"The significance of producing socially appropriate utterances, not just linguistically correct ones, has given rise to a plethora of studies on speech acts. In this regard, the performance of second and foreign language learners against the norms of the target language and the factors affecting them have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To contribute to this ongoing research, this study aimed to elicit pragmatic requestive features of Iranian EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners with respect to (a) request directness, (b) request perspective, (c) internal modification, and (d) external modification in eight social situations. This study also examined whether language proficiency and two contextual factors of social power and social distance affect Iranian EFL learners’ requests in English. Participants were a total of 60 university students or graduates who had taken TOEFL in the past 2 years and were thus categorized into low and high proficiency levels. A Written Discourse Completion Test (WDCT) was employed to elicit requests. To achieve the objectives of this study, both descriptive statistics and two-way ANOVA were employed. The results showed a significant main effect for contextual factors; participants’ choice of requestive features was affected by the two social factors of power and distance. Proficiency, however, did not have a significant effect on the pragmatic performance of participants. The findings of this study showed pragmatic development of participants on the one hand and some evidence of their underdeveloped pragmatic performance on the other hand, which makes explicit instruction a necessity.

Saeedeh Shokouhi,2016.0,An Overview on Explicit and Implicit instructions on Learners’ Pragmatic Awareness in Making Request in English,"One of the important part of the pragmatics studies in recent years is about the intercultural communication. EFL learners should know both grammatical competence and also sociolinguistic rules to use the language in an appropriate context. This review explores the effect of the explicit and implicit instruction on the learners’ attention in the production of the speech act of request. Pragmatics includes “the study of how speakers use and understand speech acts” (Richards and Schmidt 2002). Moreover, pragmatics plays a very important role in the production and perception of the language. That is why interlocutors should have enough pragmatic knowledge to produce and perceive the proper and intended speech acts based on context. Therefore, having pragmatic competence is one of the key factors in the process of communication. Pragmatic competence in foreign language contexts is defined as the knowledge of communicative action or speech acts, how to perform it, and the ability to utilize the language in proper ways based on the context or contextual factors (Kasper 1997; Kasper & Roever 2005).",,10.5296/JSEL.V4I1.9408,https://doi.org/10.5296/JSEL.V4I1.9408,forward

Six pairs received pragmalinguistic support, while the others wrote their suggestions on their own. Audio-recorded pair discussions were coded qualitatively, and the written suggestions were analyzed in terms of linguistic and pragmatic characteristics. The results showed that pragmalinguistic support encouraged the participants to engage more in language-related and task-related episodes. Also, their suggestions contained more diverse lexical downgraders and conventional suggestion-giving expressions. By contrast, those who wrote suggestions without pragmalinguistic support engaged more in pragmatic-related episodes, relying extensively on epistemic modal verbs (e.g., would). The findings indicate that pragmalinguistic support may help L2 users to better attend to task content and language, producing lexically and pragmatically richer output.",,10.1515/iral-2021-0138,https://doi.org/10.1515/iral-2021-0138,forward

On the one hand, it investigates whether and to what extent any sociolinguistic view to language will be needed or should be applicable to the classroom situation, whether students indeed constitute an entity that owes much of its language success to the degree of sociability among the learners and the type of activity and interaction/interactivity that take place during the learning process. On the other hand and in parallel to this classroom investigation, although the importance of interactivity in website design is well recognized in Tunisia, the attention paid to understanding the impact of interactivity on consumers remains mixed. This study, therefore, draws a coextending analysis to understand how the interactivity of web commerce sites can influence the purchase intent of consumers through cognitive and emotional involvement to the website. The results indicate that the active control, reciprocal communication and synchronicity lead to cognitive and emotional involvement of the users. The general framework for investigation is founded both on a Pragmatic-Linguistic Perception (PLP) to language and on a Stimulus -Organism -Response (SOR) paradigm highlighting, thus, how research on the area of perceived interaction/interactivity may lead to answers to fundamental questions raised through research on teacher’s feedback, interaction and subsequent learning in class on one hand and internet users’ emotional and cognitive involvement and ultimate purchase intent on the other.",,10.9790/0837-191065360,https://doi.org/10.9790/0837-191065360,forward

Results revealed that explicit instruction was more effective than implicit instruction for both production and comprehension of refusals and that both implicit and explicit groups maintained the improvement in the delayed post-test administered two months later. In addition, whilst WMC scores were positively and strongly correlated with gains in the immediate and delayed post-test for both DCT and CQ in the implicit group, no meaningful relationship was found for explicit and control groups.

For the affective domain, the strategies concern development of resilience in order to maintain long-term motivation and investment of identity as an active user of the L2. For the cognitive domain, the strategies involve relearning the phonological system of the L2 as an independent system in order to counteract native language influences and using compensation tactics to supplement the influences of semantic organization of one’s native language. For the interpersonal domain, the strategies involve accommodation to communication styles and a task orientation to interaction.

The study of the development of L2 pragmatics is a promising and a vibrant area of investigation since in many of the L2 environments, Turkey being an example, communicative competence is a neglected area with the focus being on grammatical competence. What language teachers are doing in classrooms is often the teaching of grammar rules, undeniably important but never ensure the teaching of effective communicative skills alone. The teaching of “structural, functional and affective” power of the language in actual use through student projects and classroom discussion of both on the structure, the function and the effect may well help learners to become effective communicators. After the emergence of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) in 1980s, today, at least in the last three decades, people in the field are in search of improving the shortcomings of CLT. Though a number of methods have been introduced on overcoming the limitations of CLT, they only serve to complement a very small area of the gap attributed to CLT. On the other hand, TBLT, introduced to language teaching market by Prabhu, embraces quite a large area that CLT has left behind.

"Rasoul Mohammad Hosseinpur, Reza Bagheri Nevisi",2018.0,L1-based Instruction: Does It Work for Learning Pragmatics in the EFL Context?,"An overview of interventional studies in the field of interlanguage pragmatics reveals that researchers and practitioners were first concerned with the teachability of pragmatics. Their findings indicated that particular features of pragmatics are teachable, and instruction is both necessary and effective (e.g., Alcon-Soler, 2008; Alcon-Soler & Martinez-Flor, 2008; Jeon & Kaya, 2006; Ishihara & Cohen, 2010; Martinez-Flor & Uso-Juan, 2010; Rose, 2005; Rose & Kasper, 2001). The second issue in the ILP research dealt with the question of exposure versus instruction. The findings demonstrated that pedagogical intervention is more helpful for pragmatic learning than exposure to positive evidence (e.g., Alcon-Soler, 2005; Eslami-Rasekh & Eslami-Rasekh, 2008; Jeon & Kaya, 2006; Takahashi, 2010). Due to the consensus over the need to teach pragmatic competence, the main issue now centers on the question of how this competence should be attended to in the most effective way. A compelling body of interventional studies has targeted explicit/deductive and implicit/inductive teaching designs, generally suggesting an overall trend in support of explicit/deductive instruction (e.g., Ishihara, 2010; Martinez-Flor & Uso-Juan, 2010; Takahashi, 2010). This interest has overshadowed a third possibility: the employment of learners‟ mother tongue which has recently received a remarkable amount of attention in second language acquisition (SLA) research (e.g., Cheng, 2013; Lee & Macaro, 2013). Therefore, drawing on an already established means of pragmatic instruction and a recently growing trend in the classroom, the present study is an attempt to compare and contrast the relative effectiveness of explicit/deductive and L1-based instruction of pragmatic competence.",,10.18823/ASIATEFL.2018.15.1.18.233,https://doi.org/10.18823/ASIATEFL.2018.15.1.18.233,forward

"A. Bataineh, Nadhim Obaid Hussein",2015.0,The Effect of Using Web-Cam Chat on the Undergraduate EFL Students’ Pragmatic Competence,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of using web-cam chat on developing of the pragmatic aspects of language by college-level English as foreign language (EFL) learners in Jordan. A quantitative approach was applied to determine first, whether the use of web-cam chats had a positive effect on EFL learners’ pragmatic competence. Second, the effect of presenting pragmatic through two delivery systems face-to-face, in-class activities and computer-mediated communication (CMC) via web-cam chats i.e. Facebook and Skype was investigated in this study. The sample of the study consisted of thirty-two undergraduate students who made up two intact classes in a ""Conversation Skills course, which call Penguin Functional English by Peter Watcyn-J0nes .Code N 1302109” at AL al-Bayt University in Jordan, during the second semester of the academic year 2013/2014. The students were interviewed in order to know their actual levels in the pragmatic aspects of English before starting the experiment. The sample  was divided into two groups; the control group (15 students) was taught the course content using the regular communicative method through which students received instructor-led lessons from the textbook, while group two, the experimental (17 students) was taught using web-cam chat. After conducting the activities, a post test was administered. Scores were tabulated and prepared for statistical analysis. The results showed that web-cam chat had a positive impact on the EFL learners’ pragmatic competence. Learners who studied via web-cam chat performed better on the pragmatic aspects of English post-test than those who did not. The findings also indicated that technology can be a valuable tool for delivering pragmatic instruction. Moreover, the findings of the study revealed that students acquired the speaking and listening skills in web-cam chat more efficiently and effectively than in the regular communicative method.",,10.5296/IJE.V7I2.7929,https://doi.org/10.5296/IJE.V7I2.7929,forward

More specifically, it analyzes whether being exposed to captioned and non-captioned input in an experimental condition entailing no instruction on pragmatics might have any influence on the learners’ pragmatic performance. To this aim, two intact classes (N = 31) of learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) at a B1 level were exposed to videos with captions and without captions, respectively. Before and after watching the videos, all the students were asked to carry out a role-play task with situations like those in the videos. A mixed-methods approach was used to analyze the learners’ performance in terms of types and number of strategies to perform speech acts (quantitative) and in terms of pragmatic appropriateness (qualitative). Findings show that both groups used more polite strategies after watching the videos, regardless of the captioned/non-captioned condition, which seems to confirm the contribution of audio-visual material for the learning of the L2 pragmatics in an incidental way. Concerning pragmatic appropriateness, we found that learners in the captioned condition produced more pragmalinguistically appropriate role-plays than learners in the non-captioned condition, thus suggesting a positive effect of captioned material on the learning of the L2 pragmatics. Such results are discussed in relation to the few previous similar studies in the field.",,10.1177/13621688211067000,https://doi.org/10.1177/13621688211067000,forward
"Leila Ranta, Alisa Zavialova",2022.0,The Challenges of Conducting Research in Diverse Classrooms: Reflections on a Pragmatics Teaching Experiment,"For researchers, the typical way of determining whether a pedagogical innovation works is by conducting an experiment. In migrant settings, however, experiments are more challenging to carry out due to the diversity of the learner population. Unfortunately, how to deal with these challenges is not addressed in a practical way in research methods textbooks, which typically provide a normative view of the research process. This paper aims to draw attention to the realities of classroom research carried out in the Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC) setting. These classes consist of adult immigrants and refugees from a wide range of cultural, linguistic and educational backgrounds. We illustrate how this diversity along with other characteristics of LINC programs impact the decision-making of the researcher with respect to a pedagogical experiment focused on pragmatics. The study compared a formula-enhanced approach to teaching speech acts to the more mainstream approach aimed at raising learners’ meta-pragmatic awareness about speech act behaviour. The pre-post-delayed-post-test gains appear to favour the Formula group, but the interpretability of these results is compromised by the fact that the composition of the two classes was very different. Discussion of the limitations of this case study feeds into a broader consideration of the implications for classroom research of linguistic and cultural diversity typical of L2 educational contexts like LINC.",,10.3390/languages7030223,https://doi.org/10.3390/languages7030223,forward

"A. Barron, Muriel Warga",2007.0,Acquisitional pragmatics: Focus on foreign language learners,"Abstract 1. Introduction Calls for research into the acquisition of pragmatic competence in a second language have been a familiar feature of the interlanguage pragmatic landscape since the 1990s. Indeed, one of the first of these many calls was made as early as 1992 by Kasper in an article focusing on pragmatic transfer. In this article, she writes “… the majority of interlanguage pragmatics studies focus on use, without much attempt to say or even imply anything about development” (1992: 204) (cf. also Kasper & Dahl 1991). This observation was then verbalized rather forcefully in a very influential publication written by Kasper and Schmidt (1996) dedicated exclusively to the acquisition of second language (L2) pragmatic competence and designed “… to profile interlanguage pragmatics as an area of inquiry in second language acquisition research …” (1996: 149). In this seminal publication, they write: Interlanguage pragmatics, the study of the development and use of strategies for linguistic action by nonnative speakers, has a peculiar status in second language research. Unlike other areas of second language study, which are primarily concerned with acquisitional patterns of interlanguage knowledge over time, the great majority of studies in ILP has not been developmental. Rather, focus is given to the ways NNSs' pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic knowledge differs from that of native speakers (NSs) and among learners with different linguistic and cultural backgrounds. To date, ILP has thus been primarily a study of second language use rather than second language learning. (1996: 150)",,10.1515/IP.2007.008,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP.2007.008,forward

Gilmore,2011.0,“I Prefer Not Text”: Developing Japanese Learners’ Communicative Competence with Authentic Materials,"This quasi-experimental study reports on a 10-month classroom-based longitudinal investigation, exploring the potential of authentic materials to develop Japanese learners’ communicative competence in English. Sixty-two second-year university students were assigned to either a control group receiving textbook input or an experimental group receiving authentic input, and their pretreatment and posttreatment levels of overall communicative competence were assessed. Communicative competence was operationalized with a batch of eight different tests: a listening test, a pronunciation test, a C-test, a grammar test, a vocabulary test, a discourse completion task, an oral interview, and a student-student role-play. The results indicated that the experimental group outperformed the control group in five of the eight measures, suggesting that the authentic materials and their associated tasks were more effective in developing a broader range of communicative competencies in learners than the textbook materials. I discuss the pedagogical implications of these findings for language teachers and their learners.",,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2011.00634.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-9922.2011.00634.X,forward
"Isgandar Bababayli, Nalan Kızıltan",2020.0,A comparative sociopragmatic analysis of the dialogues in Turkish and Azerbaijani B1-B2 EFL textbooks,"Different communities assess social distance, social power, rights and obligations, and degree of imposition used in specific speech acts differently. As a result of this difference, foreign language learners are likely to make sociopragmatic failure. This kind of failure is harder to correct because of the learners’ justifiable sensitivity in social (or political, religious, and moral) matters. Nevertheless, the research has proven the effectiveness of instruction on development of learners’ awareness of sociopragmatic aspects of language use. However, there is almost no investigation on the representation of sociopragmatic variables in second or foreign language textbooks. Considering that textbooks are essential for providing input for the learners in development of their sociopragmatic competence, we compared EFL textbooks designed for and employed in public schools of Turkey with those designed for and employed in public schools of Azerbaijan, to evaluate how sociopragmatic and related variables have been addressed in dialogues present in these textbooks. The results of the investigation revealed that there are some significant differences between Turkish and Azerbaijani textbooks regarding representation of speech acts, vertical distance, and strength of socially defined rights and obligations. These differences, on the other hand, can be accounted for by the inadequate representation of speech situations. By this study, we aspired to draw textbook writers’ attention to such inadequacies elimination of which may result in sociopragmatically more adequate textbooks, and attract second- or foreign language teachers and learners’ attention on the significance of sociopragmatic competence for appropriate language use.",,10.17263/JLLS.803869,https://doi.org/10.17263/JLLS.803869,forward

While most previous SA empirical studies on second language (L2) pragmatic development focused on finding out learners’ comprehension or production of certain pragmatic features, few have explored how their pragmatic competence developed during SA. This qualitative case study aims to examine how four international students from China applied the conversation routines they noticed during SA into communication practice during SA in the UK. Interview data were collected and analyzed. It was found that during SA the students: a. developed different and new knowledge of L2 (English) conversation routines; b. revealed evidence of L2 pragmatic development in terms of pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic competence. Several factors may have played facilitative role in their pragmatic development: attention to L2 input, positive L1 pragmatic transfer, positive attitude and strong motivation towards L2 language and culture, etc.",,10.14355/IJMEF.2014.0302.01,https://doi.org/10.14355/IJMEF.2014.0302.01,forward

More specifically, it explored how MLs’ interlanguage requests converged or diverged from English Natives’ (ENs) requests in the use of strategy types and (in) directness.  First, a contrastive pragmatic analysis of requests by Moroccan natives (MNs) and ENs is deemed necessary to provide native baseline data and establish MNs’ and ENs’ pragmatic norms of request performance. Second, an interlanguage request analysis is conducted to reveal the pragmatic features of MLs’ requests. The three sets of data for this study were collected via an open questionnaire as it serves the purpose of this investigation. The results revealed that MLs deviated from the ENs’ pragmatic norms of (in) directness, mostly by falling back on their native pragmatic norms, which bears testimony to pragmatic transfer. Requests do not seem to be conceived of in the same way by MNs and ENs, and MLs transferred their native request conception when performing in English. MLs used more direct strategies. The study predicts instances of cross-cultural misunderstanding and pragmatic failure in intercultural encounters between MLs and ENs, which is likely to cause undesirable cross-cultural clichés and stereotypes. The paper suggests some pedagogical implications to alleviate this problem among MLs.

However, they ignore the special role of translanguaging practice, which helps express meaning more clearly, build intercultural identities, and maximize learners’ bilingual/multilingual ability. In this paper, the author takes her own former English class as an example, recalls and records five reflective blogs, and analyzes the feasibility of translanguaging in this context. It is found that while translanguaging has certain benefits, it also has some drawbacks, such as inhibiting the formation of authentic L2 context. A few insights are briefly proposed from three angles: Policymakers cannot ignore the benefits of translanguaging and should advocate it, educators should act as multilingual role models and co-learners; learners should use their linguistic repertoire critically to develop their social and intercultural awareness.",,10.54475/jlt.2024.022,https://doi.org/10.54475/jlt.2024.022,forward

The cognitive linguistic approach consisted of applying the metaphor politeness is distance in the teaching of different degrees of politeness. It involved a spatial concept projection through which participants could understand degrees of politeness in terms of the spatially visualized concepts of near–far and high–low relationships associated with three social variables – closeness, power, and speaker difficulty – in either animated or static illustration. In contrast, the non-cognitive linguistic approach involved rote learning of target English polite requests in a list. The results demonstrated that the static version of the cognitive linguistic approach enabled participants to process degrees of politeness and perform as well as those who underwent the animated version. Moreover, the animation effects did not appear to have had a major impact on the overall performance of groups subjected to both cognitive language approaches.

Also, 43 American native English speakers were employed to provide the baseline data for the development of the recognition test and the instructional materials. To carry out the study, the researchers matched 60 subjects in two groups based on their scores on the Oxford Placement Test (2004) and their inclination to interpersonal or linguistic intelligence. The groups were then randomly assigned to instructional conditions, namely the DIG and CR tasks. These tasks were utilized to implement the instructional treatment in eight sessions. The results revealed no significant differences between the participants in the DIG and CR tasks on the production and recognition measures. Due to the initial differences on the recognition measure, the pretest-posttest mean differences revealed that the DIG task was more effective in the enhancement of learners’ recognition ability.

Specifically, the paper examines and compares requestive strategies in request emails between two groups of university students, namely English majors (EM) and non-English majors (NEM).

Amra I. Sultan,2018.0,Measurement of Sociolinguistic Competence of EFL Post Graduate Students,"   Sociolinguistic competence (henceforth SC)refers to the understanding ,or organization of  the principles of  language use that are determined by the features of  the specific language use context ; it enables us to present language functions in ways that are appropriate to that context. The ability to adjust one's speech to fit the situation in which it is said is called sociolinguistic competence, and without this ability, even the most perfectly grammatical utterances can convey a meaning entirely different from that which the speaker intended. Post-graduate students (henceforth PGSs) find it difficult to communicate freely in the target language. The ‘de-emphasized’ status of this competence in educational practice has to do with the fact that it is closely related to the sociocultural  part of acquiring a foreign language  sociolinguistic confusion can make learners seem so inappropriate as to cause misunderstanding . 
     For nonnative speakers, the misunderstandings they are often faced within the cross-cultural realization of communicative acts usually arise from their failure in appropriate use of pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic competence. Without attempting to  identify and discuss the features of  the language use circumstances that determine the principles of  language use. Cross cultural differences , results in misunderstandings between the speech participants, and can cause serious breakdowns in communication. These rules of speaking can be slowly acquired by the language learner as he/she is immersed in the target language culture; however, learning these rules through immersion is a time consuming process, with many rules going unnoticed for years, or even worse, never being acquired at all. important area of difficulty that PGSs face  is communication. 
  
     This study will focus on SC because it seems to be the most neglected aspect among the four categories of communicative competence in foreign language curriculum. When engaged in authentic communicative situations, they often lack some of the vocabulary or language items they need to get their meaning across. The study also aims at measuring SC of EFL Post Graduate Students and finding out whether there is significant differences between male and female students′ performance which leads to the level of sociolinguistics competence . 
     A test has been constructed and its validity and reliability have been ascertained  to measure SC among PGSs. Bachman and Palmer (1990:328) scale used to measure SC.

Annual Review of Applied Linguistics 31. 289–310). The present study represents a contribution to this growing area set in the particular context of an eTandem partnership. Data is drawn from Language LINC, a corpus of telecollaborative eTandem interactions between German-speaking learners of English and English-speaking learners of German. The eTandem meetings that comprise this corpus were centred around tasks to be completed for the students’ respective language classes. The study investigates how learners and native speakers manage a pre-specified discussion topic set for the English portion of an eTandem meeting. As the topic is prescribed, it imposes constraints on the students’ interactions and requires them to continue talk on this topic for an extended amount of time. Student participants delimit their talk by clearly initiating and later closing down the topic. Within these boundaries, questions are used as a resource to confront the interactional problem of extending talk on the prescribed topic.",,10.1515/cercles-2017-0005,https://doi.org/10.1515/cercles-2017-0005,forward

Significant differences were observed in all three dimensions analysed: internal and external modification, and perspective. The data demonstrate learners' overuse of zero marking in internal modification and overuse of preparators in supportive moves. External modification patterns also differed qualitatively in learners' provision of detailed content and in native speakers' employment of interpersonal orientation moves. Native speakers used significantly more requests employing impersonal perspective and in association with a range of mitigating, elliptical and formulaic devices. In this paper, we explore these quantitative & qualitative differences in patterns of speech act behaviour and consider the implications for learner development.",,10.1515/mult.2010.004,https://doi.org/10.1515/mult.2010.004,forward
Elly Ifantidou,2014.0,Pragmatic Competence and Relevance,"This book probes into under-researched issues in L2 pragmatics. Firstly, pragmatic competence, pragmatic awareness and metapragmatic awareness are re-defined and clearly distinguished on theoretical grounds. Secondly, pragmatic competence and its manifestations are evaluated on empirical grounds by distinct criteria and validated testing measures. More importantly, genuine pragmatic inference is elicited in contexts of online interpretation where figurative speech plays a central role. Genre-specific discourse which occurs in editorials and news reports serves as a natural testbed for examining the role of advanced mind-reading abilities in developing pragmatic competence. Sperber and Wilson’s relevance theory accommodates the findings of empirical assessment and yields new insights in the cognitive procedures activated during interpretation. The comprehensive theoretical and methodological treatment of pragmatic competence makes this book of interest to researchers and students in pragmatics, L2 theory and applications, genre studies, and to those concerned with the cognitive underpinnings of communication in L2.",,10.1075/pbns.245,https://doi.org/10.1075/pbns.245,forward

The study also aimed to explore the perceptions of EFL learners on the instruction of these markers in their writing classes. 120 female undergraduates who are Arab EFL learners took part in the investigation. A mixed-methods research design was adopted with an explicit instruction group, an implicit instruction group and a control group. The experimental groups were introduced to a set of interactional metadiscourse markers as per Hyland’s (2005) interaction model in two 70-minute sessions. Additionally, the experimental groups completed two post-experimental questionnaires. The results of analysis of variance showed a positive, albeit very limited, influence for the explicit/implicit teaching with the markers of self-mentions, appeals to shared knowledge, directives and questions. As for the participants’ perception of the instructional intervention, the participants viewed both explicit and implicit instruction as helpful but could not always apply what they had learned due to task demands. The results are discussed in light of the existing literature and the specific context in which the study was implemented.

As a stride toward narrowing this research niche, the objectives of this research were threefold. Firstly, it aimed to examine the two face-threatening speech acts of request and apology as indicators of learners’‎ interlanguage pragmatic competence (ILP) and its relationships with learners’ Emotional Quotient (EQ). Secondly, it sought to investigate ‎whether gender as an intervening variable would have any significant relationship with ILP and EQ, and thirdly whether EQ could predict ILP ‎development. To this end, 72 (50 females and 22 males) Iranian lower-intermediate level learners ranging ‎in age from 17 to 25 from two universities took part in this research. A multiple-choice discourse completion test ‎‎(MDCT) (Liu, 2004) and Bar-Onʼs ‎(1997) EQ scale were used and correlation analysis was done to search for any linkage between ILP and EQ. The Pearson product-moment correlation outcomes ‎revealed no significant relationship between EQ and ILP. However, a significant relation was found between Independence as a component of EQ and ‎EFL learners’ ILP competence. The independent samples t-test outcomes indicated ‎that female participants had a higher level of (ILP) competence than male participants; however, male and female participants did not differ significantly regarding their EQ level. The findings indicate that ‎EQ, in general, is not influential in EFL learners’ ILP competence.

Eva Alcón-Soler,2017.0,Pragmatic Development During Study Abroad: An Analysis of Spanish Teenagers’ Request Strategies in English Emails,"ABSTRACT Previous research has shown that adolescent second language learners benefit from pragmatic instruction during study abroad (Alcón-Soler, 2015). As a follow-up investigation, the present study looked at late adolescent study-abroad learners, and it examined both the immediate effect of pragmatic instruction and the pragmatic trajectories that adolescent learners follow once they move from the instructional context to real email communication. Email requests in English produced by 60 (30 treatment and 30 control) Spanish teenagers studying in England were analyzed with regard to the impact of instruction on the frequency of indirect request strategies and internal modifiers. In addition, the pragmatic trajectories of two learners—one high producer and one low producer of request modifiers—were analyzed qualitatively on four separate occasions during the study-abroad experience. The findings show the positive effects of instruction on learners’ use of indirect request strategies and request modifiers. However, there is no homogeneous pattern of change during participants’ study-abroad experiences. Closer examinations of the pragmatic trajectories of two learners show that learners’ perceptions of request imposition or their desire to be accepted in the community in which they find themselves may explain pragmatic changes.",,10.1017/S0267190517000125,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190517000125,forward

 The present study explores the influence of individual differences in experience, perceptual acuity, and working memory on the development of both declarative and automatized aspects of L2 phonological vocabulary knowledge. A total of 486 Japanese English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) students took part in two vocabulary tests designed to measure declarative (meaning recognition) and automatized knowledge (lexicosemantic judgement task). Their performance was tied to the quantity and quality of their EFL experience, as well as their scores in auditory processing and working memory. While several significant, modest correlations between experience, aptitude, and vocabulary outcomes were observed, certain predictor variables were uniquely associated with either declarative or automatized vocabulary performance. Specifically, individuals with more extensive, typically language-focused EFL training and greater working memory demonstrated higher levels of declarative knowledge. Conversely, those who pursued extracurricular practice outside the classroom – exposing themselves to auditory materials and/or participating in study-abroad experiences – showed a more automatic execution of vocabulary knowledge.",,10.1017/s1366728924000609,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1366728924000609,forward

Elizabeth Mokoro,2024.0,Pragmatic Competence in Second Language Learners,"Purpose: The general objective of the study was to analyze pragmatic competence in second language learners. 
Methodology: The study adopted a desktop research methodology. Desk research refers to secondary data or that which can be collected without fieldwork. Desk research is basically involved in collecting data from existing resources hence it is often considered a low cost technique as compared to field research, as the main cost is involved in executive’s time, telephone charges and directories. Thus, the study relied on already published studies, reports and statistics. This secondary data was easily accessed through the online journals and library. 
Findings: The findings reveal that there exists a contextual and methodological gap relating to pragmatic competence in second language learners. Preliminary empirical review revealed that pragmatic competence is crucial for effective communication in a second language, often lacking in learners despite their grammatical proficiency. Explicit instruction in pragmatic norms and strategies significantly improved learners' communication abilities. Cultural immersion and authentic language use were found essential for developing practical pragmatic skills. The study also highlighted the importance of considering individual differences, such as motivation and language aptitude, to tailor instruction and enhance pragmatic training effectively. 
Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The Speech Act Theory, Politeness Theory and Socio-Cultural Theory may be used to anchor future studies on pragmatic competence in second language learners. The study highlighted the need for a broader theoretical understanding that integrates sociolinguistics and cognitive sciences, recommended incorporating pragmatic skills into language curricula through authentic dialogues and interactive activities, and advocated for policies that prioritize pragmatic competence in language proficiency standards and assessments. It emphasized the importance of cross-cultural awareness and recommended collaborative efforts among educators, researchers, and policymakers to develop comprehensive frameworks. The study also suggested ongoing research to monitor the effectiveness of these changes and adapt educational practices accordingly.",,10.47941/ejl.2044,https://doi.org/10.47941/ejl.2044,forward

It compares flipped classroom instruction with the conventional method of developing learners’ request speech acts. To this end, the participants were randomly divided into two groups: experimental and control. A Discourse Completion Task (DCT) was conducted as pre- and post-test to determine whether flipped classroom instruction is more effective than the conventional method in providing learners with pragmatic knowledge needed to produce request speech acts successfully. Data were analysed using a paired sample t-test. The results showed that flipped classroom instruction was more effective than the other method in raising the level of pragmatic competence among the participants. The study results also revealed that the participants’ performance on request speech acts in the treatment group remarkably improved in the post-test. This is because they had a more flexible and accessible e-learning environment, which in turn, enhanced their pragmatic competence after the treatment. The study concludes with recommendations for further research. https://doi.org/10.26803/ijlter.18.10.6",,10.26803/ijlter.18.10.6,https://doi.org/10.26803/ijlter.18.10.6,forward

Based on focus group interviews with students and teachers, we show that Danish students and teachers find it awkward to adopt the German Sie when German is the language of instruction in Denmark, typically resulting in pragmatic transfer of the Danish informal norm instead. Adopting a critical pedagogy perspective, we discuss how Sie seems to violate Danish cultural values of egalitarianism, causing cultural cognitive dissonance (CCD) in CLIL learning environments. We show that Danes cope with CCD by rejecting Sie or employing (sometimes quite complex) strategies to avoid direct address altogether. However, our investigation also reveals that CCD is partly locational/situational, and that Danes are less reluctant to use Sie in Germany or towards a native German teacher, suggesting a need to raise awareness about this issue in CLIL-courses and foreign language courses where language and intercultural training is taking place ‘at home’ and possibly with a teacher who is not a native speaker of the language. Finally, we offer some suggestions for attenuating this discomfort by rethinking the way that German polite forms of address are taught, and we make the critical point that a major premise of CLIL teaching - the idea of learning a foreign language ‘on one’s own territory – may give rise to cultural resistance, to which teachers should be alert.",,10.7577/fleks.2135,https://doi.org/10.7577/fleks.2135,forward

Implicit Literary, as one of the literary groups was exposed to typographically enhanced plays containing the speech acts of, refusal, apology, and request. Explicit Literary, the other literary group received the same speech acts and metapragmatic instructions on the acts as well. For the nonliterary groups, dialogs which contained the given functions served as the medium of instruction for either Implicit Nonliterary containing enhanced input or Explicit Nonliterary having input plus metapragmatic information. All participants took a Multiple- Choice Discourse Completion Test (MDCT) and a Written Discourse Completion Test (WDCT) both before and after the instruction. Analysis of the participants’ performance on the pretest and posttest WDCT did not reveal any significant difference between the literary and nonliterary groups. Concerning the mode of instruction, explicit groups outperformed the implicit ones. Pre and posttest analyses of the participants’ performance on the MDCT revealed no significant differences among the groups in terms of the four teaching conditions implying that EFL learners’ knowledge of speech acts can be boosted by pragmatic instruction irrespective of the medium or mode of instruction.",,10.1080/2331186x.2019.1662979,https://doi.org/10.1080/2331186x.2019.1662979,forward

To address this issue, accreditation and registration bodies for a number of health professions, such as social work and nursing, have advocated for increasing the test score requirements for university English language entry. However, from a sociolinguistic perspective, decisions concerning ways to address communication challenges need to take into account the unique communication skills required for functioning in specific workplace settings. It is therefore essential to identify the types of communication issues occurring during work-integrated learning opportunities (e.g. placement) and to then assess whether these should be addressed by raising general English proficiency or providing structured learning opportunities for profession-specific communication development within the course content. The present study uses sociolinguistic theory to examine placement educators’ perspectives on international students’ communication issues using the context of social work placement. It draws on the thematic analysis of interviews with 15 placement educators in Australia. One major finding is that international students’ general proficiency or ability to use specific linguistic tools (pragmalinguistic competence) is not a key area of concern for educators. The main challenge seems to involve the students’ understanding of sociocultural norms underlying workplace communication (sociopragmatic competence). This finding suggests that, rather than increasing English language entry requirements, universities need to provide international students opportunities to develop their sociopragmatic competence both before and during placement. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations aimed at supporting international students who speak English as an additional language to develop their workplace communication during their studies.",,10.1007/s10459-022-10155-1,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10459-022-10155-1,forward

Furthermore, none have juxtaposed the effect of incorporating an output-based instruction with an input-based one. The study employed an experimental design over a 13 week period with 90 students randomly assigned to the one of the five groups consisting of four treatment groups and a control group. Each treatment group received one of the following kinds of instructions: (a) individual input-based, (b) collaborative input-based, (c) individual output-based, or (d) collaborative output-based. Treatment groups’ performance was compared with that of a control group on pretests and posttests consisting of a multiple choice discourse completion task and a written discourse completion task. The results indicated that there was a significant difference between pre- and posttests of the four experimental groups in both awareness and production. The results lend support to Schmidt’s (1993) noticing hypothesis and Swain’s (1985) output hypothesis and provides evidence for the success of Sharwood Smith’s (1991, 1993) input enhancement techniques.

The study found that the non-native speaker teachers (NNSTs) evidenced a developed sense of sociopragmatic knowledge in high imposition L2 requests for action, and employed politeness strategies that were indicative of a concern to maintain social and face relationships in virtual consultations. It is argued that despite their advanced English language proficiency, the teachers’ reliance on directness, excessive formality, and lengthy grounders could still put them out-of-status and render their emails as pragmatically inappropriate. The study further confirmed significant differences in how the two groups perceive appropriateness and politeness in direct and unmodified student email requests to faculty. Overall, while the NSs judged the emails primarily according to their content and, to a lesser extent, according to their form and framing devices, the NNSTs focused almost exclusively on form and framing devices (in/formality, in/directness, nature and extent of mitigation, opening/closing moves, forms of address).",,10.1515/pr-2020-0046,https://doi.org/10.1515/pr-2020-0046,forward

We particularly focused on proficiency-level effects and on the role of the task type in the use of request acts peripheral modification devices. We ascertained participants' degree of bilingual competence by means of a bilingualism test, which was designed on the basis of previous research (Li Wei, 2000). Additionally, a level placement test was distributed to our participants, and their performance was assessed on the basis of the ACTFL proficiency guidelines. Data for our analysis were collected by means of an open discourse completion test and a role-play task. Results from our analysis point to differences between bilinguals' and monolinguals' use of peripheral modification devices. More specifically our study shows that (1) L3 learners of English employed request modifiers more frequently and appropriately than L2 English learners, (2) intermediate learners performed better than beginner learners both in the oral and written task, and (3) the written task allowed for a wider use of peripheral modification devices although results also show that internal modification devices were highly employed in the oral task. Findings from our study seem to call for further research on the pragmatic competence of third language learners of English thereby considering other speech acts or pragmatic aspects and also by analysing subjects from different linguistic backgrounds.",,10.1080/14790710508668378,https://doi.org/10.1080/14790710508668378,forward

A total of 120 participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire with two major parts: a Scaled Response Questionnaire (SRQ) and a Discourse Completion Task (DCT). Elicited data were analyzed in terms of three perspectives: perception of face-threat, overall correction strategy use, and the use of external modifications. The results showed some similarities and differences between Chinese and Americans’ corrections. As for the EFL learners, they exhibited their interlanguage development in the perception and overall strategy use. In addition, instances of L1 pragmatic transfer were found in the learners’ use of some individual strategies and external modifications. Learners’ interlanguage development and L1 socio-cultural transfer demonstrated the multi-competence of the learners. The present study suggests that further instruction should be implemented to enrich L2 learners’ pragmatic repertoire for successful ELF communication.",,10.1515/IRAL-2015-0097,https://doi.org/10.1515/IRAL-2015-0097,forward

M. González‐Lloret,2019.0,Technology and L2 Pragmatics Learning,"Abstract The field of technology and language learning, also known as CALL (computer-assisted language learning), is now a robust area of study informed by research and practice in the fields of language education, computer science, psychology, sociology, cognitive science, cultural studies, and, most of all, applied linguistics and second language acquisition (SLA). As with any other large field of study, some subareas have become the focus of study, often influenced by advances and research in applied linguistics, while others remain to be explored further; among these is the area of technology-mediated second/foreign language (L2) pragmatics, also known as interlanguage pragmatics. The lack of research in this area is puzzling if one considers that pragmatic competence is one of the essential components of communicative competence and that most of the technologies today exist in the service of communication. This article reviews the efforts so far to explore the connections between interlanguage pragmatics and a variety of technologies and innovations, as well as existing resources to bring L2 pragmatic teaching into the language classroom. It then suggests unexplored areas where technology could be used to aid the development of pragmatic competence and where pragmatic theory can inform SLA research.",,10.1017/S0267190519000047,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190519000047,forward

"Marcella Caprario, Naoko Taguchi, R.

This study has two goals: (1) to describe the communicative functions of the pragmatic marker I mean in academic discourse; and (2) to provide instructional activities for teaching the multiple functions of the pragmatic marker I mean. Bottom-up corpus-linguistics techniques were used to discover frequent functions of I mean in a corpus of interactive classroom discourse. The results revealed three main communicative functions: (1) argumentation management, (2) communication management, and (3) interaction management (cf. Fant. 2016. Pragmatic markers in high-level second language use. In Advanced Proficiency and Exceptional Ability in Second Languages, ed. K. Hyltenstam, 15–42. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton). The results also revealed a range of subfunctions, including self-correction, elaboration, rapport building, and pause filling while holding the floor. These findings provided an empirical basis for the creation of pedagogical materials.

Findings have revealed an overall positive proficiency effect on pragmatic competence, and in most cases higher proficiency learners have higher pragmatic competence. However, increased proficiency does not guarantee a native-like pragmatic performance because proficiency effect varies depending on the nature of target pragmatic features such as types of speech acts (degrees of directness and conventionality) (e.g., Cook & Liddicoat, 2002; Felix-Brasdefer, 2007), modalities of pragmatic performance (comprehension and production) (e.g., Bradovi-Harlig, 2008, 2009), social variables involved in task situations, such as social status (e.g., Allami & Naeimi, 2011), social distance (e.g., Maeshiba, Yoshinaga, Kasper, & Ross, 1996), and power relationship (e.g., Al-Gahtani & Roever, 2012).

Finally, six classes were observed by the researchers to get informed of their real classroom practices. The results of data analyses were then triangulated, and the findings revealed that Iranian EFL instructors used explicit strategies rather than implicit strategies to instruct speech acts in their classes.

The amalgamation of studies has been conducted on many speech acts around the world within the two decades, among which apology is considered as the second most-appreciated speech act in Iran. The aim of the current meta-analysis is twofold: first, to unravel the overall effectiveness of the instruction in an Iranian EFL context on the speech act of apology, and second, to explore whether treatment types and research designs moderate this effectiveness. To this end, out of a total number of 31 studies, 12 papers were chosen based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria, which were coded for the analysis. The results of the study revealed that the instruction of apology is effective for this speech act, and it documented a medium effect size. Furthermore, it was found that research design is a good predictor for this effectiveness, and the quasi-experimental group displayed a large (g = 2.39) and positive effect. Although treatment types (e.g., explicit & non-explicit) produced medium and large effect sizes, they are not a suitable predictor for the overall effectiveness of instruction on the aforementioned speech act.

There was also a control group of 11 native speakers of Mandarin. Quantitative results based on a 20-item audiovisual interpretation task demonstrate that the L3 learners of Mandarin were not on a par with native speakers of Mandarin in arriving at an intended implicature for the test items. A qualitative analysis of learner responses indicates that the learners’ interpretation of conversational implicatures in L3 Mandarin, although usually successful, was also characterized by repetitions, literal comprehension, and recognition of a gap between the literal and the implied meaning, as well as unintended implicatures.",,10.1515/lingvan-2024-0132,https://doi.org/10.1515/lingvan-2024-0132,forward

After the completion of the intervention, a posttest and, after eight weeks, a delayed posttest was given to both groups to examine the effectiveness of the PCR intervention. The analyses of the scores of the groups revealed that first, the treatment was effective on the EFL learners’ pragmatic performance and second, the treatment significantly enhanced the experimental group’s ability to produce appropriate suggestions. Also, the study showed that the trend of structure and strategy use by learners in the treatment group changed as a result of the PCR treatment from the pretest to posttest and delayed posttest conditions. This study showed that consciousness-raising at the metapragmatic level improved EFL learners’ pragmatic performance and variety of form-strategy use substantially; thus, it should be taken more seriously in L2 instruction and material development.",,10.17507/JLTR.0602.13,https://doi.org/10.17507/JLTR.0602.13,forward
Qing Liu,2019.0,"L2 Pragmatic Competence in Chinese Secondary Schools - Teaching Approaches, Teaching Materials, and Classroom-Based Assessment","English as a L2 (second language) is compulsory in many countries’ education. However, the pragmatic competence is far less developed, compared with the grammatical competence. This situation leads to a fact that many students are confident in grammar-oriented tests, but afraid of starting a conversation. Or, in many cases, the students may bewilder the native speakers. This paper concerns the teachability of L2 (Second Language) pragmatic competence in Chinese secondary schools. It starts with a relatively comprehensive introduction of some very basic concepts, including pragmatics, pragmatic competence, and ILP (interlanguage pragmatics). Next, the necessity of consciously learning of L2 pragmatic competence is discussed within the specific context, as well as its teachability. After that, challenges of L2 pragmatic competence teaching are raised from three aspects: 1) challenges for teachers in the teaching process; 2) lack of authentic L2 pragmatic input; and 3) the testing and assessment of L2 pragmatic competence. Finally, feasible ways to facilitate the teaching application of L2 pragmatic competence are proposed.",,10.20849/AES.V4I1.604,https://doi.org/10.20849/AES.V4I1.604,forward

Under the experimental test conditions, interlanguage parallels were predicted to arise from acquisitional pressures imposed by derivational economy on universal grammar (UG)–guided semantic interpretation. The results of a task in which participants matched sentences to multiple discourse depictions confirmed the predicted parallels. However, in matching underinformative sentences to depicted contexts, the L2 and deaf learner groups overactivated discourse-pragmatic knowledge. The restriction of indefinite noun phrases to singleton indefinites and the cancellation of scalar implicatures rendered sentences more informative in underinformative contexts, producing incorrect—although principled—interpretations. These results inform English acquisition at the interface of semantics and discourse pragmatics and provide further support that economy pressures yield L2 learner and deaf learner interlanguage parallels as observed, for instance, in learners’ interpretative knowledge of universally quantified English sentences.",,10.1017/S0272263111000490,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263111000490,forward

The existing studies examined the effects of ESL and EFL settings on pragmatic development from a variety of standpoints. Taking these studies as the basis, this comparative case study aimed to investigate the effects of target context and foreign context on the pragmatic development of two groups of learners, one learning a foreign language (English) and the other learning a second language (Turkish). What differentiates this study from the previous ones is that it compares the cases of learning foreign and second languages (by two different student groups) in the same country (Turkey) The participants, selected on purposeful sampling, were one group of Turkish learners of English in an EFL department in Turkey and the other group was learners from different nationalities learning Turkish in Turkey. The data were collected through participants’ self-reports, interviews and in-class observations by the researcher. The content analysis mainly revealed that the foreign context did not offer learners adequate chances for exposure to and practice in the target language, which negatively influenced their pragmatic development. However, the target context provided ample chances of natural and authentic communication in which learners of Turkish could develop their pragmatic knowledge and production. Based on these results, some pedagogical and practical suggestions are provided.        ",,10.26817/16925777.457,https://doi.org/10.26817/16925777.457,forward

Ninety-six high school English learners were assigned to groups for text-based chat, audio chat, and face-to-face interactions to complete a collaborative writing task in pairs. Two versions of the Written Discourse Completion Test (WDCT) were employed as pre-tests and post-tests to assess and compare the learning outcomes in request-making across the three groups. Cognitive and social engagement of learners were assessed by using multiple measures derived from chat logs and recordings, while a post-task questionnaire was utilized to gauge emotional engagement during the task. The results indicated that learners in the face-to-face and audio-chat conditions demonstrated higher levels of cognitive engagement compared to the text-chat group. The text-chat group reported fewer instances of negative emotions. In terms of request learning outcomes, all groups showed an increase in sociolinguistic appropriateness; however, no significant differences were found in overall pragmalinguistic competence.

The data are derived from pre- and post group discussions and discourse completion tasks as well as post instruction participant reflections on group negotiations and intercultural communication. Instruction was found to have had a positive impact on the pragmatic competence of these participants as well as raising their awareness of cultural differences as they learned to interact in an intercultural third place.

Zsuzsanna I. Abrams,2020.0,Key Concepts in Intercultural Communication,"Throughout our lives we becomemembers of and learn to communicate in an ever-increasing range of social groups: our families, friends, colleagues, and strangers in familiar and unfamiliar situations. Our interactions in these communities helps us “acquire the culturally requisite skills for participating in society, including appropriate ways of acting, feeling, and thinking” (Ochs & Schieffelin, 2008, p. 3). We perform different social roles in various social groups, and mostly weave seamlessly among our social selves, without much awareness of the subtle rules that guide our beliefs, behaviors, and communication. Typically, there is little consequence to our lack of awareness, and it is not until we embark upon an intercultural journey – traveling to a new country or meeting people with different cultural backgrounds from ours – that our assumptions are put to the test, and we are confronted with the revelation that how we have always communicated might not work everywhere or in every situation. Since the world is increasingly connected socially, politically, economically, and technologically, due to growing immigration and innovations that have made travel and communication easier (Mauranen, 2012; Neuliep, 2018), such intercultural encounters are now the norm rather than the exception. Consequently, learning how to interpret and participate in this interconnected world is a basic necessity and responsibility of twenty-first-century global citizenship. Being aware of our beliefs, behaviors, and communicative practices – the way they shape our thinking and interactions – can facilitate more effective encounters with members of other cultural groups. Martin and Nakayama (2018), Jackson (2014), and Oetzel (2009) identify several imperatives for studying intercultural communication: peace, economics, technology, demographics, ethics, and self-awareness.

However, their study adopts a speech-act framework that does not differentiate between pragmatic production and pragmatic comprehension . L1 learners develop a comprehension stage before producing appropriate utterances (Berk, 2012), and it may be that L2 learners do likewise. To advance pedagogy, this paper addresses four research questions within the context of a residential, immersive language program in an EFL setting: 1) Is there any relationship between language proficiency and the production aspect of pragmatic competence? 2) Is there any relationship between language proficiency and the comprehension aspect of pragmatic competence? 3) To what extent does an immersive language program lead to the development of the production aspect of pragmatic competence? and 4) To what extent does an immersive language program lead to the development of the comprehension aspect of pragmatic competence? Japanese first-year college students (n=30) were assessed through three instruments at the start of a one-year language immersion program: TOEFL PBT; a 32-item pragmatic production test (Bardovi-Harlig, 2009); and a 58-item pragmatic comprehension test (Taguchi, 2007, 2008, 2012). The correlation between language proficiency and pragmatic production, as well as between language proficiency and pragmatic comprehension, was computed through Pearson correlation coefficient. Fifteen of the subjects thereupon participated in an intensive language program. At the end of the academic year, all 15 subjects took the pragmatic production and comprehension tests again (post-tests). The findings of the one-year longitudinal study on the efficacy of language instruction in an immersive language program, and its relation to both production and comprehension aspects of pragmatic competence, is demonstrated. Language proficiency had a positive correlation with gains in both pragmatic production and pragmatic comprehension. Also, language instruction, even without specifically addressing pragmatic instruction, had a significant effect on developing both pragmatic production and pragmatic comprehension.",,10.3968/10542,https://doi.org/10.3968/10542,forward

I. Kecskés,2015.0,How does pragmatic competence develop in bilinguals?†,"This paper aims to discuss how the emerging new language with its own developing socio-cultural foundation affects the existing L1-governed knowledge and pragmatic competence of adult sequential bilinguals. It is assumed that these bilinguals already have an L1-governed pragmatic competence at place, which will be adjusted to accommodate the socio-cultural requirements of the new language. So there is no separate L2 pragmatic competence. What happens is that the existing L1-governed pragmatic competence becomes bilingual pragmatic competence while changing dynamically under the influence of the new language and its socio-cultural requirements and behaviour patterns blending the emerging features and skills with the existing ones. I will argue that there is a basic difference between the development of pragmatic competence in L1 and the sequential development of bilingual pragmatic competence. While the former is controlled mainly by the socio-cultural environment the latter is mostly motivated by individual will and preference. In the L1 language development and social development go hand in hand as a mostly subconscious, automatic and instinctive process in which individual consciousness and willingness to acquire social skills and knowledge play a relatively limited role. The whole process depends mainly on exposure to and nature of socio-cultural environment. Bilingual pragmatic competence, however, develops differently. When the new language is added gradually the existing L1-governed pragmatic competence is affected (besides exposure to L2 and environment) and motivated by individual control, consciousness and willingness to modify existing skills and behaviour patterns and acquire particular social skills and ignore others. This is not to say that the socio-cultural exposure and environment is not important. It of course is. However, it appears that there is more individual control included in bilingual pragmatic development than is the case in L1 pragmatic development.",,10.1080/14790718.2015.1071018,https://doi.org/10.1080/14790718.2015.1071018,forward

In order to find a fitting methodology, and in the absence of any guidance within applied linguistics, we willingly delved into challenging techniques and debates from other disciplines. A few years later, we had to search long and hard to find enough synthesists working on language learning and teaching issues to warrant a book, but we did, and we saw that new effort as an important, if initial, step towards the adoption and adaptation of research synthesis, and particularly the subset of methods known as meta-analysis, to the problems of applied linguistics. Now, some ten years after our first publication on the topic, applications of meta-analysis have increased dramatically in the field, as this Timeline clearly shows. For some topics (e.g. interaction, corrective feedback), we have even seen several studies replicating and building on each other. We are pleased with these developments and welcome the efforts of the field to engage in rigorous and meaningful reviews of L2 research, with an eye towards cumulative explanation of key phenomena.

Marjorie N. Gómez,2016.0,Centrándose en Actos de Habla para Entender y Enseñar Pragmática en la Instrucción de Idiomas,"Pragmatics is considered to be an important aspect of language instruction. Today, scholars in language instruction recognize that learners must develop linguistic as well as pragmatic competence. Pragmatic competence helps learners understand, employ, and interpret language in context. However, pragmatics is regarded as one of the most strenuous aspects of language teaching and learning. Studies in pragmatics still seek to respond to the question about the teachability of targeted pragmatic features, which opens the question about whether pragmatics can be taught effectively. Can pragmatics be fully taught or must educators focus on key features of pragmatics such as speech acts, which is perhaps currently the most important established part of the subject? Certainly pragmatics and language teaching should accompany each other. However, in order to assist and assess learners in the appropriate use of language in context, language teachers today must receive some explicit instruction about pragmatics themselves. They need to be acquainted with the resources available to teach pragmatic norms. Speech acts, as part of pragmatics, can help teachers orient their instruction on developing a general awareness of how language forms are used in context. Speech acts provide a framework on which teachers can build learning opportunities for L2 pragmatic development. Speech acts can greatly support students´ development of pragmatic competence. Focusing on speech acts to teach pragmatics seems to be the answer today in language instruction; at least until new classroom research arise to help teachers find resources and materials of pragmatic features and norms.",,10.5377/FAREM.V0I16.2605,https://doi.org/10.5377/FAREM.V0I16.2605,forward

However, student writers often encounter difficulties in this aspect. Scholars have thus called for explicit instruction to develop students’ academic writing ability as a sustainable goal. Learning stance-taking is a particularly relevant area of intensive interest among writing scholars. Yet, few empirical studies have been conducted to examine its effectiveness on students’ academic writing quality and stance deployment. To fill this gap, a quasi-experimental research was conducted with 46 undergraduate students in a Chinese university, who were randomly assigned to two conditions: a treatment group and a comparison group. The treatment group received an eight-week explicit stance instruction, while the comparison group received curriculum-based writing instruction at the same time. Academic texts were collected both prior to and after the period of intervention. Results revealed that the treatment group outperformed the comparison group in the post-test in terms of academic writing quality and stance performance. Their writing also exhibited changes in the frequencies of an array of stance types deployed (e.g., proclaim: pronounce, proclaim: endorse, entertain, attribute), indicating their enhanced understanding of stance and improved competence of mitigation and integrating external voices for better academic writing.

The results revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding knowledge of speech acts. However, the results of the paired samples t-test conducted to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the groups’ DCT pre and post-tests. The study revealed that task type did not have a crucial role in learning speech acts; however, it encouraged the use of films for teaching speech acts.",,10.29252/IJREE.5.1.53,https://doi.org/10.29252/IJREE.5.1.53,forward

Veronika Timpe-Laughlin,2016.0,Learning and Development of Second and Foreign Language Pragmatics as a Higher‐Order Language Skill: A Brief Overview of Relevant Theories,"The development of effective second and foreign (L2) language learning materials needs to be grounded in two types of theories: (a) a theory of language and language use and (b) a theory of language learning. Both are equally important, insofar as an effective learning environment requires an understanding of the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are being targeted as well as an idea of how learner development progresses. Although the author and colleagues have previously provided a theoretical basis for the construct of L2 pragmatic ability, and thus a theory of language use, the current paper focuses on learner development, particularly on the theoretical orientation towards L2 pragmatic learning. Given this superordinate goal, the paper will briefly review different theoretical paradigms that have been employed in adult L2 pragmatics development research. In the first part of the paper, I will provide an overview of the cognitive, socially oriented, and emergentist perspectives used in research on L2 pragmatic development. Then, based on the different ontological perspectives, I will discuss the affordances and challenges of applying a theoretical perspective to designing L2 pragmatic learning environments, drawing upon the example of the cognitively oriented information processing theory.",,10.1002/ETS2.12124,https://doi.org/10.1002/ETS2.12124,forward
A. Barron,2016.0,Developing pragmatic competence using EFL textbooks: Focus on requests,"Learning to request in a foreign language is a key competence within communicative language teaching. This paper examines how requests are taught using English G2000A (Cornelsen), an EFL textbook series employed in many schools in Germany. The focus of analysis is on the linguistic request strategies and request modification (pragmalinguistics) to be learned and on the contextual information provided on the use of these linguistic forms (sociopragmatics). Findings reveal that commonly employed request strategies and cognitively simple forms of modification are introduced – also in line with developmental patterns. However, it is also found that many strategies are not dealt with and that modification is only touched on. On a sociopragmatic level, a strong focus is found to exist on standard situations in which role relations are clear. Contextual constraints are generally communicated implicitly only and there is a general danger of overgeneralization. Finally, the textbook only considers cross-cultural differences in requesting to a very narrow extent. The paper closes with some recommendations.",,10.20533/licej.2040.2589.2016.0288,https://doi.org/10.20533/licej.2040.2589.2016.0288,forward

However, less is known about the effectiveness of instruction for disagreements, which are face-threatening acts that establish a point of view counter to the interlocutor. Therefore, the current study explored the effect of explicit instruction with different forms of practice on Colombian EFL learners’ (N = 31) use of politeness strategies when disagreeing. Over a two-week period, a comparison class (n = 8) received explicit instruction only, while two experimental classes received both explicit instruction and practice through task repetition. Whereas the procedural repetition class (n = 12), repeated the same task procedure four times with new content, the content repetition group (n = 11) repeated the same content with different task procedures. The participants carried out a pretest, immediate and delayed posttests, which consisted of discourse completion and role play tasks. The results indicated that the procedural repetition group used significantly more politeness strategies in both the discourse completion tasks and role plays. Implications for L2 instruction in EFL setting and pragmatics research are discussed.",,10.1080/09571736.2016.1167232,https://doi.org/10.1080/09571736.2016.1167232,forward

Gabriel Bărbuleț,2024.0,Pragmatic strategies in teaching the Romanian language to international students,"The following paper examines effective language-teaching strategies for international students learning Romanian amidst the increasing globalization. Addressing challenges faced by diverse learners, the study employs a methodology encompassing literature review, classroom observations, and interviews with experienced instructors. Emphasizing the importance of pragmatic elements in language instruction, the research explores the integration of technology, cultural immersion, and real-world applications to enhance pragmatic competence. Grounded in sociolinguistic theories, the article underscores the role of pragmatic competence in effective communication. Beyond linguistic structures, language instructors are urged to incorporate nuanced elements reflecting Romanian culture. Pedagogical strategies tailored to international students include task-based activities, role-playing, and language immersion. Assessment involves qualitative analysis of student performance, feedback, and proficiency assessments. The article also delves into the role of technology, discussing the integration of virtual reality, online platforms, and multimedia resources for immersive learning. The study concludes with implications for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers, advocating for culturally sensitive language curricula. Overall, it contributes to the discourse on language education by emphasizing the interconnectedness of language and culture, promoting pedagogical approaches that foster cross-cultural communication.

The findings revealed a complex picture with mixed results. Even though external modification showed some positive effects after the intervention, the study revealed no gains in relation to the overall use of internal modification as the learners’ overall use of lexical/phrasal mitigators deviated even more from NS usage after the pedagogical treatment. We argue that, in relation to the learners’ pragmalinguistic performance, the results seem to confirm the fact that surrounding factors such as the duration, quantity and quality of the pedagogical intervention play a complex role in accounting for such mixed findings. Results further showed that the way learners perceived social reality was not affected by the instructional treatment. Our findings suggest that learners’ sociopragmatic development may not be as easily amenable to teaching as pragmalinguistic development. The development of L2 sociopragmatic awareness seems to need both longer explicit pedagogical instruction and rich exposure to the target language environment.",,10.5070/L210333950,https://doi.org/10.5070/L210333950,forward

Drawing on Taguchi’s (2018) classification of pragmatics learning strategies, the instructional intervention followed a strategy-based approach to help learners understand the form–function–context mapping of email requests in the academic context. A total of 110 naturally occurring email requests for action addressed to three faculty members were collected at two different times: as a pre-test (i.e. before engaging learners in the instructional period), and as a post-test (i.e. after learners’ participation in the treatment sessions). Learners’ email messages were analysed considering both their appropriateness of use as well the frequency of utilization of different structural (i.e. subject line, openings and closings) and content components (i.e. request strategies and internal request modifiers). Results showed that strategy instruction helped learners write more appropriate email requests after the instructional period.

It is a language spoken in South Sumatera, Indonesia, henceforth referred to as Palembangnese. The overall goal of this paper is to contribute to the wider literature on the use of directives. However, in particular, this paper aims to enrich the current understanding of data from linguistic politeness in Palembangnese, especially the usage of Palembangnese when the students are making directives, both in their verbal interactions with each other and with their professors or lecturers. A large number of studies have been conducted on directives in relation to politeness in different languages. However, up to now, limited research concerning the politeness and the use of directives in Palembangnese has been conducted. Twenty Indonesian students in Indonesia were recruited as participants. The participants of this study were native Palembangnese speakers in Indonesia (PSinI). This research based its argument on a corpus data elicited by means of a Palembangnese version of Written Discourse Completion Tasks (WDCTs), demographic information questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews. The data were analyzed and focused on five major politeness strategies proposed by Brown and Levinson (1978). The results of the study contribute to the increased understanding of politeness and the use of directives in Palembangnese. This present research contributes to teaching and learning in university settings by providing better understandings of the association between cultures, including beliefs and values, and politeness strategies of students from Palembangnese language backgrounds.

M. González‐Lloret,2022.0,Technology-mediated tasks for the development of L2 pragmatics,"Developing pragmatic competence implies the learning of the norms and principles that affect the behavior of participants in a culture (i.e. sociopragmatics) and the ability to choose the language to realize those norms (i.e. pragmalinguistics). Learning to be pragmatically appropriate in the second language (L2) is not easy, and although it is possible without instruction, research shows that instruction helps development (Plonsky & Zhuang, 2019). This article advocates that technology-mediated tasks are an excellent and effective pedagogic tool to promote L2 pragmatic development. The article will introduce some key findings of studies that incorporate technology and pragmatics as well as those that have investigated tasks and L2 pragmatics to then focus on those studies that incorporate the three elements: tasks, technology and L2 pragmatics. These studies are grouped by their main focus of investigation: (1) the task, (2) the technology, or (3) the L2 pragmatic feature. As a whole, these studies show the possibilities that tasks and technology-mediated contexts have to engage learners in discursive practices that may not be possible otherwise, exposing them to the cyberpragmatics of an ever-growing digital world.

Methods: Fourteen undergraduate students (Ab Initio, Intermediate and Advanced Japanese level) who studied Japanese language at University of Sussex in the 2020/21 used Sail App to practice speaking Japanese with native Japanese speakers who were registered Sail App users living in Japan. Sussex students were asked to have a total of 6 speaking and listening skills evaluations by 5 Japanese native speakers who were also Helte Co Ltd staff. The 5 Japanese native speakers evaluated 14 students on 4 occasions (the initial baseline evaluation, the second month, and the third month and final evaluation). The students also self-evaluated of their listening and speaking skills on 2 occasions (the initial baseline evaluation and the final evaluation). Results: After three months, only 1 student completed all 6 evaluations and 3 students completed 4 native speakers’ evaluations by Helte Co Ltd staff. The majority of students’ speaking ability remained unchanged. However, the perception discrepancies of speaking and listening skills between Sussex students and Japanese native speakers were found. Conclusion: The majority of Ab Initio and Intermediate level students had a tendency to evaluate their listening and speaking skills higher than those by native Japanese speakers.

"Elly Ifantidou, Angeliki Tzanne",2012.0,Levels of pragmatic competence in an EFL academic context: A tool for assessment,"Abstract This paper discusses an advanced language assessment tool designed to assess university students' linguistic competence in L2. The tool serves the final exam of a course offered to second-year students of English language and literature. Of the three parts of the exam, (1) reading, (2) language awareness, and (3) writing, the third part (language awareness) explicitly addresses students' pragmatic competence. In the light of our work, assessing students' pragmatic competence is shown to involve the identification of certain levels of competence ensuing from the interpretive routes learners follow in their attempt to (a) interpret the communicator's intention, (b) identify the linguistic devices that lead them to this interpretation, and (c) explicitly verbalize the link between linguistic devices and interpretation. The suggested ranking of levels draws on data from statistical analysis of 190 final exam scripts. The proposed assessment of pragmatic competence manifested when dealing with written discourse is considered to be an innovative testing tool, because it is a discourse-based approach to testing pragmatic competence, where both explicit and implicit meanings are retrieved by drawing on a naturally-occurring wide range of lexical and grammatical features. More importantly, the proposed assessment constitutes an accurate testing tool because it allows for levels of pragmatic, hence linguistic, competence to naturally unveil in an authentic reading context requesting the reader's spontaneous reaction and contribution to the process of meaning making in L2.",,10.1515/IP-2012-0003,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP-2012-0003,forward

The data analysis started by transcribing the speech recordings and by identifying the structures of the speech acts. This was followed by categorizing the communicative functions being performed. The last stage involved interpreting the contextual meaning of the speech acts. Three qualitative conclusions are arrived at in connection with and emerging from interpretations of the textual data: (1) the speech acts produced by the participants used various structures such as statements, questions, commands, instructions, prohibition and description; (2) the speech acts denoted various kinds of communicative or speech functions like expressives, directives, representatives, referentials, comissives, and metalinguistics; and (3) the occurrence of one particular communicative function can dynamically entail specific kinds of communicative functions in the light of the available context.  Some categories of speech functions were not consistent with the purpose of the communicative event of thesis examination.",,10.26418/jeltim.v1i2.33263,https://doi.org/10.26418/jeltim.v1i2.33263,forward

Holger Limberg,2016.0,Teaching how to apologize: EFL textbooks and pragmatic input,"Learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) are exposed to a collection of materials and communicative activities in the classroom through which they learn to use the language competently and appropriately. Textbooks, in particular, are a rich source of input, offering a variety of opportunities to acquire and practice pragmatic competence in specific areas of language use. One such area concerns apologies. As a ubiquitous and routinized pragmatic speech act, apologies are important to master for learners who have violated a socio-cultural norm. This study examines how German textbooks for EFL learners provide input on apologies and what tasks as well as exercises they suggest to practice and perform this act in the classroom. Teaching apologies – like any other speech act – should be based on rich, meaningful and authentic input and tasks in order for learners to appreciate and make use of this competence in real-life communication. The analysis of textbooks for secondary schools in Germany reveals the existence of some apology input, but also a lack of variety in terms of apology expressions. In addition, a noticeable difference between (implicit) input and (explicit) tasks exists, which can have an influence on the development of learners’ apology competence. EFL teachers need to be aware of what textbooks can and cannot offer, and then they need to adapt input and tasks for their teaching.",,10.1177/1362168815590695,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362168815590695,forward

 This study aims to investigate Iranian EFL teachers’ perception and instructional practices towards form-focused instruction of speech acts specifically request, apology and invitation. To this aim, through sequential explanatory mixed methods design the researchers used criterion sampling and 30 English language instructors in Islamic Azad University (IAU) of North Tehran Branch served as the subjects. To attain general perception and teaching practices of instructors towards form-focused instruction of speech acts, they were asked to answer a pragmatic questionnaire. Besides, in order to achieve an enhanced awareness concerning instructors’ perceptions and practices regarding form-focused instruction a semi-structured interview was conducted for the same 30 English language instructors. Finally, six classes were observed by the investigators through convenience sampling. Likewise, through the triangulation approach, the investigators studied and merged the required data. The statistical results of the quantitative and qualitative data analysis revealed that form-focused instruction of speech acts is mostly focused by the Iranian EFL instructors. Most of them agreed with the use of explicit strategies for instructing request, apology and invitation speech acts rather than implicit strategies. Additionally, the explicit strategies were used by most of the instructors in EFL classes.

The data was collected from a football forum (Manchester United forum; likely used by males) and two parenting forums (Mumsnet and Netmums; likely used by females). These different forums were targeted to ensure a rough gender balance. Sarcasm was identified within these forums by means of a metalanguage strategy. This strategy involved searching for the metalinguistic labels sarcasm and sarcastic, and then extracting and analyzing the antecedent discourses these labels are referring to. Those discourses were considered a potential environment for sarcasm. One hundred and forty two sarcasm-containing threads were collected via the metalanguage strategy. First, the data was pragmatically investigated to reveal the general pragmatic characteristics of sarcasm (e.g. Contradiction: saying something and meaning the opposite or Insincerity: flouting the Gricean quality maxim), as well as its pragmalinguistic characteristics (e.g. hyperbolic expressions, capitalization, exclamation marks) that are used in the data. This is the ‗Corpus Study‘. Second, the analysed data served as an item pool for the judgment task of the L2 pragmatics study. From that pool, 30 items were ultimately selected as stimuli for that L2 study. Two groups of Iraqi EFL learners participated in the L2 pragmatics study. Each group contained 30 participants. The members of the first group were studying L2 English at home (Iraq) and had never been to any English-speaking country. The second group involved learners who received their BA and/or MA degree(s) in English from Iraq and were pursuing MA or PhD degrees at different UK universities. Members of the latter group had 1-4 years sojourn in the UK. A Control group was also provided by 30 British-English native speakers. The 30 stimuli, derived from the online data of the Corpus study, were placed in a two-fold judgement task. The task was designed to: (1) test the participants‘ recognition of sarcasm within the given texts (threads) on a 7-point Likert scale, and (2) reveal what they consider as ‗sarcastic‘ within those texts by highlighting the potentially sarcastic part(s) in them. Results of the corpus study revealed that general pragmatic characteristics bear the greatest load in creating/indicating online sarcasm. Among these characteristics ‗Insincerity‘ seems to be the most fundamental or prototypical one. As for pragmalinguistic characteristics, they appear to play only a minor role in triggering and comprehending online sarcasm. ‗Hyperbole‘ seems to be the most prototypical one among pragmalinguistic characteristics. Regarding the L2 pragmatics study, ANOVA results reveal that both learners‘ groups are significantly different from English Native Speakers. Thus, Iraqi EFL learners appear not to have reached the native level of sarcasm perception. Results also indicate no effect of studying abroad or L2 proficiency upon the sarcasm recognition of those learners. Another finding of the L2 study is that the more characteristics (general pragmatic or pragmalinguistic) available the easier the comprehension of sarcasm turns out to be for both native speakers and learners. However, learners seem to be more sensitive to pragmalinguistic characteristics than English native speakers. They are found to identify sarcasm at the sight of these features more than the native speakers do. More interestingly, the current study has also found out that sarcasm does not always express a negative attitude. Sometimes, it can be used to express a positive emotion in a friendly way. This study encourages further research on L2 sarcasm, particularly with regard to the kind and amount of L2 input the learners are exposed to. It also focuses attention on the necessity of developing the learners‘ L2 pragmatic competence in general and their competence of L2 sarcasm in particular in order to bridge the gap between their performance and that of the native speakers.",,10.17635/lancaster/thesis/262,https://doi.org/10.17635/lancaster/thesis/262,forward
"Victoria Russell, Camilla Vásquez",2018.0,Assessing the effectiveness of a web-based tutorial for interlanguage pragmatic development prior to studying abroad,"This manuscript reports the results of a research study that investigated the effect of a web-based tutorial (WBT) on 13 Spanish language learners’ pragmatic development during the semester prior to studying abroad in Spain. Students who anticipate living abroad with a host family may be particularly motivated to acquire pragmatic competence in order to better assimilate into the target language culture. The WBT was designed to teach the speech acts of complaints and requests to Spanish language learners whose first language is English. The content in the WBT is based upon available empirical evidence at the time of development. Data were collected at pretest and posttest and the analysis employed a mixed methods approach. The results revealed that the WBT was more effective with intermediate- than with novice-level learners of Spanish. In addition, learners’ comprehension gains were greater than their production gains. In other words, learners improved in their ability to recognize appropriate pragmatic strategy use; however, they still had difficulty producing pragmatically appropriate features after completing the WBT. It is possible that pragmatic awareness may precede learners’ ability to use appropriate pragmatic strategies in their linguistic output.",,10.17161/IALLT.V48I0.8579,https://doi.org/10.17161/IALLT.V48I0.8579,forward

Considerable viewpoints were obtained by analyzing the data collected from 104 Indonesian EFL teachers using questionnaires and focus group interviews. While still maintaining the conventional way of teaching English, these teachers admitted the importance of socializing English pragmatics to their students. They indicated that EFL learners needed to learn the socio-cultural norms of the target language in order to communicate appropriately. Teachers viewed politeness essential for learners to understand that failure to meet the required action might break interpersonal relationships. Therefore, they agreed that language classrooms should utilize interactive strategic tasks that involved learner-learner and teacher-learner interactions to foster the presence of pragmatic socialization in the classrooms. Even though most teachers were unsure about how they would put their ideas in practice, it was evident that teachers perceived both explicit and implicit language socialization processes promising and worth implementing. Future research may investigate how teachers socialize English pragmatics to EFL learners in real classroom settings.",,10.47750/pegegog.11.04.19,https://doi.org/10.47750/pegegog.11.04.19,forward

M. Takimoto,2014.0,Evaluating the Effects of Input-Based Approaches to the Teaching of Pragmalinguistics and Sociopragmatics in Second Language Pragmatics: A Case of English Request Hedges.,"The present study examined the effects of two types of input-based approaches ―combination of pragmalinguistics- and sociopragmatics-focused instruction (CI) and sociopragmatics-focused instruction (SI) on learners' recognizing and producing English request hedges. 45 Japanese learners of English participated in the study. Treatment group performance was compared to that of a control group on the pretests, post-tests, and delayed post-tests: an unplanned written-production test, an unplanned written-judgment test. The results showed that the CI and SI groups performed significantly better than the control group on an unplanned writtenjudgment test. There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups on the unplanned written-judgment test, which indicated that the sociopragmatics-focused instruction attracted the attention of the SI group to the sociopragmatic features of English request hedges directly, and the group perhaps then transferred their attention to the pragmalinguistic features of English request hedges. As a result, the sociopragmatics-focused activities alone had some effects on recognizing English request hedges. However, a comparison of those learners in the two experimental groups in the unplanned written-production test demonstrated an advantage for the CI group and implied that the input-based learning through not only sociopragmatics-focused activities but also pragmalinguistics-sociopragmatics connection activities contributed more to deep perceptual and mental processing of English request hedges, thereby resulting in developing more firmly established explicit knowledge.",,10.22492/IJLL.1.1.01,https://doi.org/10.22492/IJLL.1.1.01,forward

The data are oral and written ones, the former was collected by interview from the key informant from two regencies in Bali namely: Tabanan and Bangli regencies. The later, i.e written data was obtained by observation and note-taking, taken from four Balinese short stories. The collected data was analysed by applying the Pragmatic theory. The result shows that from the types of Balinese speech act verbs, there are locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary speech act verbs. Examples of the Locutionary Acts: Ia nyatua lakar luas ka Bali ‘he tells to go to Bali’ Illocutionary acts : Ia metakon dija meli togog ‘He asks where buying statue’ Perlocutionary acts : Ia nundén apang nulungin ngaba batu ‘he instructs to help him bring stone’ There are also five categories of Balinese speech act verbs, they are: (1) representatives which bind the speaker to the truth of the stated proposition:  nyutetang ‘conclude’  (2) directive which the speaker's attempts to compel the addressee to act nunas ‘request’ (3) commissives  which obligate the speaker to take some future action masamaya ‘to promise’, metanjénan ‘to offer’)",,10.21744/lingcure.v7n1.2274,https://doi.org/10.21744/lingcure.v7n1.2274,forward

Amaliah Amaliah,2024.0,A Review Article of the Pragmatics Competence in EFL Learning Context,"Cross-cultural communication requires pragmatics. Pragmatics is ""the ability to use language appropriately in social settings."" Pragmatic competence in another language involves understanding and carrying out communicative activities or speaking and using the language effectively in varied situations. Several relevant literature and library sources were used for this research. According to Kasper et al. ""Library research, like its twin, the academic experiment, involves a kind of organized investigation with prescribed instruments, rules, and tactics."" Three core library research systems are examined: checking reference sources and databases, finding and utilizing information sources, and assessing information sources according to research objectives. This article analyzes data on pragmatic competence in students of Indonesian and other foreign languages. The author used a public digital search engine to examine scientific literature on pragmatic competency studies in Indonesia to correlate disparate data and find appropriate results. Qualitative research may be more comprehensive. This study found that most studies used a descriptive qualitative approach. The exam is detailed. Most studies used a qualitative approach to characterize L2 practical skills by level and test, while one study assessed learners' cross-cultural awareness during encounters. Most studies on educational participation and the impact of cross-cultural awareness on pragmatic knowledge in EFL learning use qualitative methods, although there are three studies that use quantitative methods. Reviews and debates provide suggestions. Recent research on pragmatic competence in EFL learning settings features a descriptive qualitative approach complemented by Creswell's qualitative approach that provides greater detail about the phenomenon, and all three studies use quantitative methodology. Pragmatic competence improves EFL students' social skills. Al Khadhmi found that the pragmatic meaning of situational utterances was more difficult to interpret compared to lexical stimuli. Therefore, it is better to continuously improve certain areas, such as training EFL students' awareness before they understand a foreign language and activating pragmatic competence and pragmatic components in them, as this affects their communication inside and outside the classroom",,10.35931/aq.v18i1.3163,https://doi.org/10.35931/aq.v18i1.3163,forward

Holtgraves,2007.0,Second language learners and speech act comprehension,"Recognizing the specific speech act (Searle, 1969) that a speaker performs with an utterance is a fundamental feature of pragmatic competence. Past research has demonstrated that native speakers of English automatically recognize speech acts when they comprehend utterances (Holtgraves & Ashley, 2001). The present research examined whether this occurs for participants learning English as a second language. Participants read conversational utterances and then performed a lexical decision task (decide whether a target string of letters is a word). Consistent with past research, native speakers performed this task more quickly when the target string was the speech act associated with the preceding utterance. In contrast, nonnative speakers did not demonstrate this effect, suggesting that speech act activation is not an automatic component of comprehension for people acquiring a second language.",,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00429.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00429.X,forward

Anderson’s adaptive control of thought–rational (ACT-R) model, which emphasises the development of skill through repeated practice, offers a useful framework for understanding how pragmatic speed can be enhanced. This study set to examine the impact of an ACT-R based form of instruction, input-based practice, on the development of pragmatic recognition and oral production of English refusals in a group of Iranian English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. It compared the results from that pedagogic treatment with those from a similar group following ‘6Rs’ metapragmatic instruction, which does not include repeated activities. A total of 115 Iranian EFL students took part in the study. The findings suggest the value of both input-based practice and metapragmatic instruction in developing different aspects of L2 pragmatic competence; input-based practice was found to impact more on language learners’ pragmatic speed while the 6Rs approach had a more consistent impact on pragmatic accuracy.",,10.1080/09571736.2016.1186722,https://doi.org/10.1080/09571736.2016.1186722,forward

A lack of appropriate knowledge and pragmatic activities may limit students’ pragmatic growth in the target language. Thus far, most pragmatic research has focused on issues concerning learners’ pragmatic competence, with only a few studies focusing on teachers’ pragmatic competence, particularly in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) contexts. A total of 86 EFL teachers from Saudi public schools participated in this study. The questionnaire created by Ivanova (2018) was used to collect data for this study. The findings indicated that even though some teachers did not respond or provided irrelevant or incorrect examples of speech acts, Saudi EFL teachers have a relatively high level of awareness in general, and teachers’ qualifications and gender have no significant effect on pragmatic awareness, with female teachers having slightly higher pragmatic awareness than male teachers, and master’s degree holders having slightly higher pragmatic awareness than bachelor’s degree holders. This suggests that, while individual characteristics, such as gender and degree, have no apparent effect on awareness, teachers should be aware of their own pragmatic competence to develop their students’ pragmatic competence.",,10.46687/jjtj7006,https://doi.org/10.46687/jjtj7006,forward

Eighteen upper-intermediate learners of Chinese were assigned to either an instructed or non-instructed group to determine the efficacy of instruction designed to enhance their study abroad year in China and beyond. A three-stage pre-post-delayed longitudinal experimental design was adopted to examine instructional effects over an academic year, elicited by means of a computerised oral task (COT). The assessment was based on quantitative appropriateness ratings and a qualitative analysis of the output. Results show that the instructed group outperformed the control group immediately after the pre-study abroad (pre-SA) instruction, as well as after the year abroad. The significant difference between the two groups, however, decreased after the period abroad as the control group also showed significant improvement without the pre-SA instruction. Nevertheless, the sustained effect of the instruction enabled the experimental group to retain their competitive edge, even after a year in the target language country.

"Anna Szczepaniak-Kozak, Emilia Wąsikiewicz-Firlej",2018.0,Pragmatic competence of teachers: a contrastive case study of native and non-native teachers of English,"The existing studies on pragmatic competence of English teachers, e.g., J. Majer and Ł. Salski (2004), E. Krawczyk-Neifar (2004), M. Savič (2016), A. Szczepaniak-Kozak and E. Wąsikiewicz-Firlej (in press), indicate that it is not varied and requires improvement in certain areas. These deficiencies might be interpreted as a result of not only the absence of pragmatic competence (PC) modules in teachertraining education but also a relatively low frequency of English teachers’ contact with native speakers (NS) of English (A. Szczepaniak-Kozak 2010). Nevertheless, we know very little what shape teacher PC takes, including the way it differs from that represented by NSs. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies based on data collected in naturalistic settings (lessons of English). Consequently, this paper attempts to fill in this gap in research by presenting the methodology and conduct of a case study, based on classroom observation of teachers’ pragmatic performance, to investigate whether there are differences in the PC represented by non-native teachers (NNTs) and native teachers (NTs) of English. The findings indicate that NTs do not hold the upper hand in this regard and that a demonstrable linguistic and pragmatic competence, along with appropriate professional training, are better indicators of diverse pragmatic input. On this basis, we propose that some degree of proficiency in pragmatics and its teaching should be a requirement for a certificate or diploma for future foreign language teachers.",,10.32612/UW.25449354.2018.1.PP.127-142,https://doi.org/10.32612/UW.25449354.2018.1.PP.127-142,forward

Data analysis revealed that request-refusal adjacency pairs were co-constructed in discursive contexts through multiple turns using both linguistic and nonlinguistic turn construction units (TCUs). Learners significantly used more linguistic rather than nonlinguistic TCUs and more sentential and clausal TCUs than phrasal and lexical TCUs. Moreover, the use of pauses and continuers was significantly more than laughter, facial expression, and body language. These findings have some pedagogical implications for teachers to raise learners’ awareness of context, action, and linguistic and nonlinguistic TCUs in the production of speech act adjacency pairs.",,10.29252/LRR.12.3.8,https://doi.org/10.29252/LRR.12.3.8,forward

Advanced learners approximated native speakers both in the frequency of use and linguistic form of external modifications with regard to preparator, getting pre-commitment, promise of reward, sweetener, grounder, appreciations, confirmatory, and pre-pre strategies. However they did not approximate native speakers in the frequency of use of external modifications with regard to disarmer and apology strategies, and both in frequency of use and linguistic form of imposition minimizer strategy. In addition, advanced learners approximated native speakers both in the frequency of use and linguistic form of internal modifications with regard to conditional and understater strategies; and in the linguistic form of play down, politeness marker, consultative device, and upgrader strategies.

Thirty university-level ESL learners completed four pragmatic speaking tasks that differ in the formality of pragmatic actions. Two trained raters scored the task-based pragmatic performances using analytical rating criteria and displayed a satisfactory level of consistency and accuracy in scoring the performances. The test-takers’ retrospective reports were transcribed and analyzed to develop a valid coding scheme that consists of cognitive, metacognitive, and pragmatic strategies. An association between the test-takers’ pragmatic performances scored by the trained raters and their reported strategy use was examined. The higher-ability test takers utilized diverse strategies more frequently, ranging from varied pragmatic strategies to strategies specifically related to managing task demands, compared to the lower-ability test takers. Further, the test takers utilized distinct types of strategies appropriate to handling unique pragmatic task situations and complexities involved in each pragmatic assessment task. These findings explain how the test takers cognitively interacted with the assessment tasks and what strategies potentially led to successful pragmatic performances. The implications of examining pragmatic strategy use were discussed in terms of advancing practices of teaching and assessing L2 pragmatics.",,10.1515/ip-2019-0009,https://doi.org/10.1515/ip-2019-0009,forward
Zhenwen Hu,2014.0,Study on Developing Chinese College EFL Learners' Pragmatic Competence in Relation to Language Proficiency and Overseas Experience,"Pragmatic competence refers to both knowledge of the linguistic forms which realize particular illocution, and knowledge of the appropriate use of the linguistic forms in certain social contexts. It is an important part of the language proficiency construct. However, studies in China show that College English students' pragmatic competence is poor. Unlike second language learners, students learning English as a foreign language in China do not have many opportunities to be exposed to authentic language use. If they are not provided with sufficient pragmatic knowledge, they will have more difficulty in understanding and producing appropriate use in the target language. This paper focuses on the development of pragmatic competence and awareness on the part of college English learners in China.  Overseas experience and language proficiency are treated as two main variables which may influence students' PC development. With some data collection from students in Shanghai Second Polytechnic University, findings shows that there are significant differences in the acquisition of pragmatic competence between students with overseas experience and students without overseas experience, yet no significant differences in the acquisition of pragmatic competence between students with high and low language proficiency.",,10.4304/JLTR.5.2.391-398,https://doi.org/10.4304/JLTR.5.2.391-398,forward

The study analyzes use of thanks to you in the Corpus of Contemporary American English and the British National Corpus to gain insights for English language instruction /assessment in the American context, as well as English-as-a-lingua-franca contexts where the majority of speakers are not native speakers of English or are speakers of different varieties of English but where American or British English are for educational purposes the standard varieties. Analysis of the two corpora revealed three functions for thanks to you common to British and American usage: expressing gratitude, communicating ""because of you"" positively, and communicating ""because of you"" negatively (as in sarcasm). A fourth use of thanks to you, thanking journalists/guests for being on news programs/talk shows, occurred in the American corpus only. Analysis indicates that felicitous use of thanks to you for each of these meanings depends on the presence of a range of factors, both linguistic and material, in the context of utterance.",,10.2478/v10015-011-0018-9,https://doi.org/10.2478/v10015-011-0018-9,forward

For this reason, this study analyzed a corpus of data from some political press conferences with American and Iranian Government which is randomly selected from appropriate websites between 2007 and 2021. The study applied Clayman, Heritage, and McDonald (2006) for quantifying adversarial questions as exhibited by the press to the questions addressed the Presidents of Iran and the United States. Questions from selected conferences were coded according to adversarialness. Frequency and chi-square tests were used for analysis. The results showed significant difference across the 2 corpora in some journalists’ questions. In terms of question design, accountability questions in Iranian journalists’ questions as Persian corpus indicated higher frequency. In addition, in referencing frames, higher frequency was observed in declarative questions in Persian corpus. However, English corpus displayed higher frequency in other-referencing frames. Finally, in content adversarialness, global adversarialness indicated higher frequency in Persian corpus. Consequently, the results showed that adversarial questions were used in Persian corpus more significantly than English corpus.

It emerged to respond to the challenge of implementing DA in large classes and to meet the psychometric properties of assessment. To this end, the present study attempted to design a unique computerized dynamic assessment tool to diagnose learners’ development of pragmatic competence, specifically their knowledge of the speech acts of apology and request. To conduct the research, a number of 60 BSc students of engineering, aged 18-24, participated in the study. They had different proficiency levels, including pre-intermediate, intermediate and upper-intermediate levels. In the course of CDA, they were provided with 30 multiple choice discourse completion tests of apology and request and they were required to choose what they would say in that specific situation. The participants received pre-established meditational hints for each of the unacceptable responses, which were arranged from the most implicit to the most explicit. Finally, to diagnose learners’ development, their test performance, including their actual score, mediated score and learning potential score (LPS), was instantly displayed. Paired samples t-test showed development in learners’ mediated score. The results of the univariate analysis of variance showed that there is no interaction between mediation and proficiency level.

Nearpod is a useful cloud-based application to support self-paced learning. This paper aims to probe the effect of learning through Nearpod on EFL learners’ request performance. Researchers designed seven self-access courses to teach requests. The data was collected from 11 EFL learners through Online Oral Discourse Completion Tasks before and after the treatment. The post-test results revealed that the participants significantly improved their request performance after the treatment. The learners’ responses in the pre-test and the post-test were also qualitatively analyzed for an in-depth investigation of the changes in their requesting behavior. The findings revealed that the learners stopped modality generalization and started using a variety of modal verbs according to the context of situation after the treatment. Additionally, it was indicated that self-paced pragmatics instruction helped learners overcome the pragmatic failures regarding the main verb use in request head acts. Furthermore, the differences regarding the learners’ use of internal and external modifiers were also documented. After the treatment, they performed various internal modifiers that were either absent or uncommon in the pre-test data. Alerters and grounders were found to be the most frequent external modifiers in both the pre-test and the post-test data set. In summary, the results indicated that self-paced learning helped learners improve strategies for performing appropriate requests.",,10.7575/aiac.alls.v.12n.6.p.67,https://doi.org/10.7575/aiac.alls.v.12n.6.p.67,forward

Specifically, this article discusses the teaching of “challenging” incongruent speech behaviours (such as sarcasm, banter, and irony) in a group of Anglo-Norman dialogues of the late Middle Ages. The present work focuses on the representation of incongruent speech acts in the dialogues, how this representation speaks to a pedagogical method that incorporated humour, and also the possible functions of humour in the pedagogical environment. The topic of incongruent performance and its pedagogical implications will also be considered. By discussing the depiction and role of incongruent speech behaviours in the dialogues, I argue that these texts were sophisticated teaching aides that may have used humour as a pedagogical tool to teach more difficult elements of language use.",,10.1515/multi-2018-0095,https://doi.org/10.1515/multi-2018-0095,forward

The results showed that in content, these raters attended to features, including amount of information, politeness, clarity, and relevance. For form, they focused on grammar, phrasing, and word choice. These features were then incorporated into the scale design, resulting in a scoring rubric consisting of two 10-point subscales, each of which contains five levels with descriptors for each performance level. For scale validation, seven experienced American writing teachers in Taiwan evaluated 84 e-mail requests written by the Chinese learners to their professors. Reliability and validity of the rating scale were explored through the FACETS analysis. The results showed that the scale can be used in a reliable and valid way.

Ross,2018.0,The Pragmatics of Requesting in the Canadian Workplace: A Comparative Investigation of Requests Presented in Workplace ESL Textbooks and Oral Discourse Completion Task Responses,"Within the workplace, pragmatic competence contributes to the performance of difficult speech acts such as requests (Wigglesworth & Yates, 2007). A prevalent concern in teaching second language (L2) pragmatics involves pedagogical materials (Bardovi-Harlig, 2017). Although previous research has found discrepancies in pragmatic language seen in L2 textbooks and elicited responses via discourse completion tasks (DCTs) (e.g. Pablos-Ortega, 2011), workplace language textbooks have seldom been investigated. Therefore, the present study used speech act typologies (Alcon, Safont & Martinez-Flor, 2005; Trosborg, 1995) and criteria for conventional expressions (Bardovi-Harlig, 2012) to identify the most frequently-occurring requests in 17 workplace language textbooks. The same process was applied to 30 native English speakers' elicited, audio-recorded oral DCT responses. Significant differences were found in the frequency of request types identified in the textbooks and elicited responses. The results suggest that workplace language textbooks provide insufficient pragmatic input for L2 learners who are preparing for the workplace.",,10.22215/etd/2018-13238,https://doi.org/10.22215/etd/2018-13238,forward

The aim of this case study is to explore the use of DMs by pre-service teachers (further referred to as ‘participants’) in EFL classroom by means of analysing the participants’ answers to the questionnaire that is designed to address the use of DMs 
in oral discourse in EFL after their school practice. The case study is informed by the view of DMs as “sequentially dependent elements that bracket units of talk” (Schiffrin, 1987: 31). The quantitative analysis of the participants’ questionnaires in statistical program SPSS version 18.0 (2009) indicates that the participants’ repertoire of DMs in their oral discourse in EFL classroom consists of such DMs as also, and, as, because, besides, but, especially, if, OK, or, so, 
and then. Additionally, the participants note that they do not use the following DMs during their teaching practice at school, e.g. indeed, moreover, and rather.

Jakupčević, Mihajla Ćavar Portolan",2021.0,An analysis of pragmatic content in EFL textbooks for young learners in Croatia,"Pragmatic competence is an essential element of communicative competence, which makes it relevant for speakers of all ages, including young language learners (YLLs). Despite the recognized importance of pragmatics, research of textbooks for adult second language (L2) learners to date has found them lacking in their approach to this key aspect of language. However, there is very little research of pragmatics in textbooks for YLLs, which would provide insight into the extent to which these materials can support teachers in including elements of pragmatic competence into their language classes. The present study aims to fill this gap by determining how much pragmatic content is included in 18 textbooks used in Croatian primary schools with learners aged 9–12 years. The textbooks are compared in regard to the percentage of pages with pragmatic content as well as the different speech acts that receive explicit attention in them. The main finding of the study is the great amount of inconsistency when it comes to the scope and treatment of pragmatic content, with some textbooks proving extremely lacking. The results present a concerning picture as all of the students using these diverse textbooks should be following the same curriculum which emphasizes the development of communicative competence.",,10.1177/1362168820986936,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362168820986936,forward

Building on previous research with adult (e.g. McConachy 2018) and young learners (Savić 2021; Savić and Myrset 2021), the present study sets out to explore how 9-, 11- and 13-year-old EFL learners use lived experiences as a resource for scaffolding their metapragmatic understandings. The data set comprises task-based group discussions performed by 167 young Greek Cypriot (n = 88) and Norwegian EFL learners (n = 79), aged roughly 9, 11 and 13. The findings reveal that lived experiences were spontaneously used by all age groups, most often to ground understandings of the interplay between language and context. In addition, they were employed to make generalisations about in/appropriate pragmatic behaviours and ground explorations of similarities and/or differences between L1 and L2. Providing empirical and pedagogical insights, this study suggests that lived experiences may be useful resources for scaffolding metapragmatic understandings in the young learner EFL classroom.",,10.1080/09571736.2022.2088444,https://doi.org/10.1080/09571736.2022.2088444,forward
Sami Hussein Hakeem Barzani,2023.0,Production of Advice Speech Act by Non-Native Speakers of English: The Case of Kurdish EFL Learners,"Speech act studies are commonly used in Second Language Acquisition research to assess second language learners’ pragmatic skills. Contrary to other speech acts, the speech act of offering advice has not been sufficiently studied and has not been a topic of cross-cultural or cross-linguistic research either, particularly among Kurdish EFL learners. The study aimed to conduct a comparative analysis of the advice speech act as expressed by Kurdish EFL learners and native English speakers. Thus, the study looked at the proficiency of Kurdish EFL users in selecting appropriate pragmatic expressions during the act of providing advice and discernible differences between male and female learners regarding the degree of (in)directness while advice is offered. Hence, the study included 82 undergraduate students from various universities in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, particularly in Erbil. This group consisted of 42 females and 40 males, all majoring in English Language Teaching. Additionally, 30 native English speakers also took part in the research. Data collection was conducted through a 12-item discourse completion test, and the collected data were subsequently subjected to analysis using SPSS. The results unveiled a significant difference between Kurdish EFL learners and native speakers. It figured out that Kurdish EFL learners are not quite aware of the social power and social distance of interlocutors while giving advice. Additionally, it was indicated that female learners are more indirect in offering advice than their male counterparts. Moreover, the findings also unearthed a visible indication of first language pragmatic transfer, though it was not a variable of the study.",,10.24093/awej/vol14no4.4,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol14no4.4,forward

 recent years in China and how the teaching content is presented in domestic textbooks from an ELF perspective. Ten college English textbooks
 that were published in the past five years (2014–2019) were selected and evaluated based on an adapted framework of CSs. The findings
 revealed a notable inclination toward certain types of macro-strategies and were not systematically mapped out. Moreover, an initial effort
 in manifesting “cultural diversity” was observed but failed to construct intercultural contexts. Knowledge explanation as well as
 student-oriented exercises were found to be conducive in consolidating learners’ acquisition of forms. However, the function and context of
 the target CSs were neglected. Furthermore, an absence of sociocultural pragmatic concern resulted in a discrepancy between explicit
 knowledge explanation and context-based practice. Accordingly, this study suggests implications for both textbook writers and instructors in
 practice.",,10.1075/AP.19031.XIA,https://doi.org/10.1075/AP.19031.XIA,forward

The results imply that explicit instruction of such expressions and semantic formulas can increase learners’ understanding of the complex phenomenon of formulaicity and help their spoken language become more pragmatically appropriate, more grammatically accurate, more fluent, concise and confident.

Interlanguage pragmatic motivation was investigated from two perspectives: (1) general pragmatic motivation, displaying L2 learners’ motivation to acquire pragmatic strategies, pragmatic routines, politeness strategies, turn-taking patterns, and cultural familiarity; and (2) speech-act-specific motivation, representing learners’ motivation to acquire the pragmalinguistic forms and sociopragmatic norms of performing speech acts. Seventy-five EFL learners were studied using two pragmatic motivation questionnaires and a discourse completion task. The relationships among the general pragmatic motivation, speech-act-specific motivation, and pragmatic production were then investigated. The findings showed that EFL learners are highly motivated to learn English language pragmatic features from both motivational perspectives. Further analyses revealed that the learners fell short of having satisfactory L2 pragmatic production. Regression equations revealed that speech-act-specific motivation has the explanatory power of predicting pragmatic production in EFL learners but general pragmatic motivation does not manifest such an influence on L2 learners’ production. It is concluded that high general pragmatic motivation does not necessarily correlate with better pragmatic production.",,10.1177/0033688212468481,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033688212468481,forward

Flack, Saira B S Karrim",2017.0,Facilitating pragmatic skills through role-play in learners with language learning disability,"Background Role-based learning involves the process whereby learners acquire skills, knowledge and understanding through the assumption of roles within real-life settings. Role-play holds potential as an effective learning strategy for children; however, there is limited research on the use of role-play as a therapy method within the field of speech-language pathology. Children with language learning disability (LLD) typically present with difficulties in social communication, which can negatively affect their social and academic achievement. Aim The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of role-play as a therapy approach targeting the pragmatic skills of stylistic variation and requesting for clarification in learners with LLD. Method The use of combined positivist and interpretivist paradigms allowed for the implementation of an embedded mixed methods design. An experimental pretest-posttest design was implemented. Eight participants, who were learners with a diagnosis of LLD, were purposefully selected. Data collection was conducted over five phases, utilising the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (4th Ed.) Pragmatics Profile, discourse completion tasks, session plans and session records. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and were supplemented by qualitative data from session records. Results Results revealed improvements in stylistic variation and requesting for clarification post role-play intervention, with minimal changes in the control group. Limitations of the study have been reported for consideration when interpreting results. Conclusion Role-play as a therapy approach targeting two pragmatic skills, stylistic variation and requesting for clarification, was found to be beneficial for learners with LLD. Recommendations for the implementation of role-play as a therapy approach were made.",,10.4102/sajcd.v64i1.187,https://doi.org/10.4102/sajcd.v64i1.187,forward

Specifically, it examined the extent to which instructors of private EFL institutes implement interlanguage pragmatic instruction in their classrooms in Iran. A mixed-method research design was employed in this study. Two hundred and thirty eight instructors participated in this study to collect the questionnaire data and 67 classes were involved in the observation. Questionnaire and observation checklists made up the quantitative instruments for data collection while observation field notes provided the qualitative data.  The quantitative data was subjected to descriptive statistics through the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 21 software and the qualitative data was analyzed based on Martinez-Flor and Uso-Juan’s 6Rs instructional model. Findings from both the quantitative and qualitative data showed that Iranian EFL instructors rarely implemented and practiced the features of inter-language pragmatics in their classes in comparison with other language areas.  The study suggests the inclusion of adequate pragmatic information not only in the instructors’ guidebooks but also in learners’ EFL textbooks and teacher training courses. The quality of EFL teaching can then be further enhanced at the higher learning institutions in EFL contexts.

The tool will primarily endeavor to support pragmatics learning within the language use domain “workplace.” Given this superordinate objective, this paper is subdivided into 2 parts. In the first section, we provide a detailed overview of previous (empirical) research, theories, and frameworks of communicative competence to review the role of pragmatics as an essential component of L2 communicative language ability. A principled, systematic, and exhaustive literature search was conducted via key word searches, and the selected literature was categorized and coded using NVivo 10 software. Next, 12 distinct models of communicative language ability that contain components of pragmatic knowledge were identified and analyzed. The commonly identified constitutive components were then reconceptualized into a proposed construct of pragmatic competence. The challenges of operationalizing pragmatic competence in both instruction and assessment are discussed. The second part of the paper constitutes a domain analysis of pragmatics in the language use domain “workplace.” First, the literature is reviewed for communicative tasks and activities that feature prominently in different workplace settings across various English-speaking countries. Then, we suggest and exemplify different model task types that can be employed in the context of learning and assessment materials that aim to foster pragmatic-functional awareness in both English as a foreign language (EFL)/English as a second language (ESL) learners and first language (L1) speakers alike.",,10.1002/ETS2.12053,https://doi.org/10.1002/ETS2.12053,forward

This study aimed to explore the impact of nonnative teachers’ professional experience on the use of criteria in monologic and dialogic assessment of 12 role-plays of 3 apology speech acts. To this end, 60 raters were divided into 2 subgroups of raters with under and over 5 years of professional experience and rated the role-plays monologically and dialogically. A content analysis of the raters’ descriptions of the ratings showed 3 groups of criteria: the general criterion (appropriateness), pragmalinguistic criteria (linguistic features, L1 effect, paralinguistic features, directness, and adequacy), and sociopragmatic criteria (politeness, repair, truthfulness, promise, thanking, reasoning, personal trait formality, genuineness, and expression of apology). We also discovered that neither the more experienced nor the less experienced raters paid due attention to the sociopragmatic criteria in the monologic and dialogic ratings of pragmatic performances. Both groups of raters based their ratings primarily on the general criterion of appropriateness in the dialogic ratings. However, in the monologic ratings, the more experienced ones preferred pragmalinguistic criteria, and the less experienced ones opted for the appropriateness criterion. An analysis of the influence of the type of rating on the raters’ application of criteria showed that the raters differed in the use of all the 3 groups of criteria in the monologic ratings, whereas in the dialogic ratings, their difference in the application of criteria narrowed down to the sociopragmatic criteria. The findings have implications for teacher education programs on pragmatic assessment, urge considerations for the role of teachers’ experience in pragmatic assessment, and stress the inclusion of dialogic ratings in the assessment of speech acts for improving the quality of raters’ assessments.",,10.22055/RALS.2015.11257,https://doi.org/10.22055/RALS.2015.11257,forward
"Fateme Davarzani, Hossein Talebzadeh",2020.0,The effect of Virtual and Real Classroom Instruction on Inter-language Pragmatic Development: Microblogging versus Traditional Instruction of Speech Acts to Iranian EFL Learners,"Despite the fact that virtual learning seems to have considerable potential for enhancing language learners’ communicative abilities, it has received less attention for improving pragmatic competence of learners in EFL educational settings. The present study was an attempt to investigate the impact of virtual and real classroom instruction of speech acts on the pragmatic awareness and development of Iranian EFL learners. To do so, a quasi-experimental study was designed and, through a homogeneity test, 57 EFL female language learners at the intermediate level were chosen. The participants were randomly divided into the experimental groups of virtual and real classroom learning and went through the procedure of pretest, intervention, and posttest; the pertinent data were collected by means of a PET test, a speech-act pre-test and comparable post-tests of speech acts. Both measures of independent and paired-samples t-test were used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that instruction of speech acts through both virtual and real classroom techniques can be conducive to the promotion of pragmatic awareness among the EFL learners in the Iranian context; meanwhile, real classroom instruction of speech acts proved to be more fruitful and more significantly elevated the pragmatic awareness of Iranian EFL learners. We conclude the study drawing on the implications of our findings for ELT and EFL policy makers, language educators and teachers, material developers, and learners.",,10.30495/JAL.2021.680904,https://doi.org/10.30495/JAL.2021.680904,forward

Three global elementary ELT textbooks, namely Interchange, Top Notch, and American English File along with the local elementary textbooks of Iran Language Institute (ILI) Series, were examined for their pragmatic content. To analyze the pragmatic content of these textbooks, the researchers used three different frameworks. The results indicated that while both global and local ELT textbooks shared a sufficient number of speech acts of request and refusal, they failed to pay enough attention to the speech act of apology regarding its frequency and the strategies through which it is performed.

"M. Khatib, M.

Two groups of freshman English majors were randomly assigned to the experimental (enhanced input) group and the control (mere exposure) group. Initially, a TOEFL test and a discourse completion test (DCT) ensured homogeneity of the groups in terms of general proficiency and pragmatic competence. Then, the participants received the instructional treatments on English politeness strategies (PSs). They read and listened to dialogues containing the intended PSs. The target PSs were in bold typeface in enhanced input group’s dialogue booklet and in regular font in mere exposure group’s booklet. Subsequently, the groups took the DCT posttest. The analysis of the pretest and posttest data revealed the following results: Iranian intermediate EFL learners differed from English native speakers in their use of PSs; there was a low relationship, an insignificant correlation (rxy = .25), between general proficiency and pragmatic competence (i.e. competence in English PSs) of Iranian intermediate EFL learners; and input enhancement had a significantly greater effect on the acquisition of English politeness strategies (both comprehension and use of PSs) than simple exposure to PSs. The study implies that EFL learners should be provided with a specific instruction on English PSs and PSs should be presented in a noticeable way (e.g. typographically enhanced).",,10.5539/ELT.V6N12P136,https://doi.org/10.5539/ELT.V6N12P136,forward

This research data is in the form of reduolication of closed class words in the use of language in the mass media. The substantive data source of this research is in the form of text in which there are data in the form of reduplicative forms. The locational data source is the national mass media, i.e. Net TV both print and electronic, which can be reached by the research team around the time of research. After the data is classified and properly verified, the next step is the analysis and interpretation of the data. The analytical method applied is a distributional method with techniques for direct elements. Finally, the results of the analysis and interpretation of the data are presented in an informal method. The results showed that the most dominant reduplication occurred in closed word classes in Indonesian in the mass media was adverb reduplication. In this study, adjective reduplication was also quite significant, even though it was not the case with adverb reduplication and verb reduplication. Reduplication of nouns occupies the least significant portion. In terms of meanings, research in a semanticopragmatic perspective rather than semantic linguistics is purely necessary to continue to be pursued so that new perspectives can be born in researching language.",,10.22216/kata.v4i1.5249,https://doi.org/10.22216/kata.v4i1.5249,forward
"A. R. Altakhaineh, Marwa Abu Hasheish, Dana Hamaydeh",2024.0,Pragmatic Failures in Intercultural Communication: Evidence from Jordan,"Aim. This paper investigates the pragmatic errors of Jordanian EFL learners from a cultural perspective on communication. It is suggested that pragmatics, or the study of how language is used in context, plays a crucial role in L2 learners’ communicative skills. Thus, the research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the lack of pragmatic competence can lead to communication breakdowns and pragmatic failure. In this study, the researchers examine the pragmatic errors such as misunderstandings produced by these learners. 
Method. A qualitative approach was employed, the data were collected from conversations between teacher and Jordanian students and informal conversation through a focus group discussion taking place inside classrooms. The data were analyzed qualitatively in light of Austin’s (1962) Speech Act Theory, categorizing the data into direct and indirect speech act, and Brown & Levinson’s (1987) Politeness Theory, by determining the category of politeness -positive, negative, off-record, bald-on record or Not Applicable- for each speech act. 
Results. The results showed that despite having a strong grasp of English grammar rules, without effective communication skills in English, EFL learners may struggle to interact with native speakers and fully participate in social and professional interactions. Learners with greater exposure to cultural materials and interactions with native speakers demonstrated fewer pragmatic errors. A recurrent theme in the data was also the learners’ struggle with indirect speech acts. The main contribution of this paper is that it explores how pragmatic failure hinders message interpretation and obstructs communication.",,10.31470/2309-1797-2024-36-2-38-62,https://doi.org/10.31470/2309-1797-2024-36-2-38-62,forward

Padam Chauhan,2022.0,Request Strategies Used by English Language Learners: Student-Professor Email Communication,"Recently, email communication between students and professors in the U.S. higher educational institutions where English is the medium of instruction has become increasingly popular. However, ESL students in these educational institutions encounter numerous challenges to write email to their professors because of their unfamiliarity with email etiquette in English, inadequate English language proficiency, and lack of understanding of socio-cultural norms and values. Also, writing emails to professors requires higher pragmatic competence and critical language awareness of how email correspondence takes place in academic setting. Email requests written by ESL students are often seen as inappropriate or informal by their professors, resulting in pragmatic failure and being rejected. To this end, the main purpose of this literature review paper is to explore the request strategies used by ESL students to write email to their professors. Finally, the author concludes the paper by pointing some pedagogical implications to the educators who work with ESL learners at the universities and colleges where English is the medium of instruction.",,10.56816/2471-0032.1144,https://doi.org/10.56816/2471-0032.1144,forward

 Pragmatic competence consists of both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic components. The choice of pragmalinguistic strategies aligned with sociopragmatic norms may vary based on situational, cultural, and individual variables. The relationship between these important aspects of second language pragmatic competence, however, is underdeveloped in the literature. To fill this gap, the present paper is aimed at investigating the pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic variations of the Iranian EFL learners from different proficiency levels. A written discourse completion task (WDCT) was adopted for collecting data. Data were analyzed using the coding categories for apologies developed in the previous benchmark studies. The findings of the study provided evidence showing both sociopragmatic and pragmalinguistic development across the levels of language proficiency. The findings can be used for the development of pragmatics-focused materials in L2 and pragmatics instruction.",,10.1163/26660393-bja10068,https://doi.org/10.1163/26660393-bja10068,forward
Doris Dippold,2009.0,Face and self-presentation in spoken L2 discourse: Renewing the research agenda in interlanguage pragmatics,"Abstract This paper introduces a more nuanced view of face and facework than the commonly used frameworks in interlanguage pragmatics. It argues that ILP not only prioritizes research on the expression of politeness in the L2 and the acquisition of politeness strategies, but that the field also does that in an extremely decontextualized manner that takes little account of the situatedness of linguistic discourse. Moreover, the paper suggests that existing accounts of face and facework with their focus on politeness alone may not be sufficient to capture speakers' projection of other aspects of self-hood, i.e. the social identities and/or attributes that they want to foreground and be attributed with in particular situations. By analyzing an argumentative conversation of two L2 learners of German, the paper shows different ways in which self-presentation is performed, e.g., by the way speakers organize their turns, the way they modalize their discourse, and the way they use markers of reference and identity. It then argues that the field of interlanguage pragmatic should move away from its focus on politeness in a limited set of speech acts and focus also on self-presentation.",,10.1515/IPRG.2009.001,https://doi.org/10.1515/IPRG.2009.001,forward

In light of the recent federal evaluation of LINC programs in Canada, which indicated extremely limited improvement in speaking and listening skills as a result of language instruction, it is important to know which textbooks offer the best opportunities for pragmatics and fluency development. We determined that very few textbook series are consistent in their inclusion of pragmatic content in terms of scope, quality, and quantity. As might be expected, oral fluency is not a major focus in integrated skills texts; however, those activities that are intended to enhance fluency development could easily be improved by an instructor.",,10.18806/TESL.V30I7.1149,https://doi.org/10.18806/TESL.V30I7.1149,forward

Furthermore, the projects introduced in Section C enable students who come from a language background other than English to apply whatever they have understood of Sections A and B to their own language and culture. While I commend the authors for addressing immensely interesting topics in their book, I have one suggestion for its future editions. The sheer excellence of the book forces the reader to wonder why the notion of vagueness, especially intentional vagueness, has not received the attention it deserves. As the authors would probably agree, there have been some useful investigations into vagueness in communication (e.g. Channell, 1994; Cutting, 2007). Therefore, I suggest that, in line with this healthy tradition of research, a separate unit be devoted to the introduction and analysis of vague language. Overall, Archer, Aijmer and Wichmann successfully make a close and strong connection between theory and practice in their book. Besides being a very informative and thought-provoking contribution, their book suggests points of departure for further research and suitable topics for discussion in advanced seminars. This book helps us to broaden our understanding of the use of language in context and is thus essential reading for undergraduate and graduate students of language as well as for teachers.

Afef Labben,2016.0,Reconsidering the development of the discourse completion test in interlanguage pragmatics,"A survey of the field of Interlanguage Pragmatics (ILP) shows that the Discourse Completion Test (DCT)2, also referred to as a ‘discourse completion task’ or a ‘production questionnaire’, has been the most frequently used instrument to evaluate second/foreign language learners’ ability to perform speech acts in a target language, despite the harsh criticism leveled against its low construct validity and its failure to represent the features of authentic discourse. Interestingly, focusing on the statement of objectives of a number of ILP studies using DCTs, one can notice that such studies rarely refer to the DCT as a language test. In addition, an overview of the DCT design process as described in several ILP studies shows that ever since its adaptation for the study of pragmatic ability (Blum-Kulka, 1982), there has been a tendency to use or adapt one of the existing DCT versions used in previous studies based on the argument of comparability of results. While a number of ILP researchers tried to improve the design of the DCT by the inclusion of rejoinders or by enhancing the prompt material (e.g. Billmyer and Varghese, 2000), few attempts have been made to reconsider the DCT development process. McNamara and Roever (2006: 253) urge for the need for “more research on testing of sociopragmatic knowledge and design of discourse completion tests for testing purposes.”The present paper starts with an overview of the literature about DCTs with special reference to the cognitive validity of the instrument and to previous studies dealing with DCT structure and content. Then, with reference to research in the fields of language testing and psychometrics, it shows that, whether used for research or instructional purposes, the DCT shares several qualities with language tests. As such, it is argued that the DCT should be treated as a language test and not as a questionnaire and should, thus, undergo a rigorous developmental process. Based on recent models of language test construction, the paper concludes with an overview of the stages of DCT development.",,10.1075/PRAG.26.1.04LAB,https://doi.org/10.1075/PRAG.26.1.04LAB,forward

Broadly considering various facets of pragmatics, pragmatic assessment has not been potentially brought into perspective. To address this discourse gap, this study, guided by the principles of mixed-method design, pursued three purposes: to inspect the matches and mismatches, to explore rating variations, and to assess the rater consistency between the holistic and analytic rating methods of disagreement speech acts in L2 by non-native English teachers. As a result, 12 different pragmatic situations for disagreement DCTs accompanied by EFL learners' responses to each situation were rated by 50 non-native English teachers. Initially, they were asked to rate it holistically, incorporating both ratings and providing comments. The content analysis of raters' comments indicated sixteen disagreement criteria. The descriptive statistics also revealed variations across different situations. Moreover, the teachers were asked to rate it analytically based on the assessment rubrics adopted from Ishihara and Cohen (2010). The findings of intra-class correlations implied that respondents were more consistent in analytic rating. Moreover, the results indicated that there was a convergence between the two rating methods suggesting that the raters adopted the same level of leniency and severity in rating. Overall, the results accentuated the significance of pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic aspects of language for EFL raters. Finally, the results of the present study place a premium on the importance of pragmatic assessment training as well as cultural awareness.",,10.22099/JTLS.2020.34820.2738,https://doi.org/10.22099/JTLS.2020.34820.2738,forward

As derived from the 2,106 scores generated, the quantitative results showed that both experimental groups significantly outperformed the control group. The qualitative results from content analysis of the interviewers’ 341 comments captured in video-stimulated recalls showed that various themes related to language ability featured most prominently in interviewer evaluations; the themes also differentiated above-average and below-average-rated candidates. The study underscores the extent to which communicative performance swayed interviewers’ judgements above other variables; these judgements in turn may prove a disadvantage for EAL candidates in their job interviews and thus merit the critical awareness and reflection of EAL candidates, interviewers, and trainers alike.",,10.1093/applin/amaa051,https://doi.org/10.1093/applin/amaa051,forward

"Rasoul Mohammad Hosseinpur, M. Farahani",2017.0,"Cultural Intelligence, Cultural Identity and Iranian EFL learners' use of Politeness Strategies","Human beings are defined as an embodiment of social and cultural understanding which can develop by engaging in various social contexts. Cultural intelligence and cultural identity are thus accounted noteworthy in learning particular aspects of language which are culture-specific. The present study intended to investigate the interaction effect of cultural intelligence and cultural identity on Iranian EFL learners’ use of politeness strategies. To this end, the participants were divided into two groups of high and low cultural intelligence and cultural identity. Moreover, regardless of their membership in the two groups, the participants were included in the assessment of the relationship between cultural intelligence and politeness strategies. Fifty two intermediate language learners whose proficiency level was determined through Oxford Quick Proficiency Test were required to fill out the questionnaires of Cultural Intelligence, L1 Cultural identity and Discourse Completion Tasks. Two-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation were used to analyze the research questions. The results of the two-way ANOVA proved no interaction effect of cultural intelligence and cultural identity levels on the use of politeness strategies.

K. Brantley,2019.0,Pragmatics as a Unifying Element for Foreign Language Instruction in French Higher Education,"Extreme heterogeneity within foreign language instruction in French higher education has led to calls to find common elements to increase coherence. Whereas debates about course content have often emphasized the importance of specificity, the presence of mixed disciplinary groups has complicated the widespread adoption of specialized teaching. We suggest that pragmatics has potential to serve as a common element because it encompasses the study of communicative action both within and outside professional communities and can thus be emphasized in any class, regardless of its degree of specificity. While pragmatic elements are fundamental to contemporary teaching approaches, we argue that these manifestations have not kept up with evolutions in interlanguage pragmatics. In order to show this, we problematize the notion of appropriateness as described in the Common European Framework of References for Languages (CEFR), comparing it with the way that the notion has been treated in contemporary interlanguage pragmatics. Finally, we provide examples of how developments in pragmatics regarding appropriateness have been integrated into both specialized and non-specialized teaching.",,10.4000/APLIUT.6813,https://doi.org/10.4000/APLIUT.6813,forward
"M. A. J. Shahi, Neda Gharagozloo",2020.0,The Study of Iranian Teachers’ and Learners’ Perceptions Towards Implicit and Explicit form - Focused Instruction of Speech Acts,"
 Pragmatic competence is an essential component in communicative competence (Bachman & Palmer, 2010; Canale, 1983). Therefore, teaching pragmatic knowledge plays an important role in a foreign language curriculum, particularly in teaching English as a ForeignLanguage (EFL). However, there exists a lack of literature about the teaching of pragmatics with little empirical research on teachers’ and learners’ perceptions in Iran. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of focus-on-form instruction (FFI) speech acts on Iranian EFL learners’ pragmatic competence. Cooperative grouping, role plays, and other pragmatically oriented tasks were used to promote the learning of the intended speech acts. To come up with conclusive and persuasive findings, 132 Iranian male and female learners, intermediate- above, served as the subjects. The Oxford Placement Test (OPT) was used to evaluate the participants’ language proficiency level. Teachers’ and students’ questionnaires about the instructions and teachers’ interview were used as the instruments in this study. Data collected by different instruments were analyzed and compared by way of a mixed method and. then was triangulated to enhance its validity and reliability. The finding of the study showed that explicitness leads to better pragmatic knowledge development than the implicit knowledge. This study showed that consciousness-raising at the metapragmatic level improved EFL learners’ pragmatic performance and variety of form-strategy use substantially; thus, it should be taken more seriously in L2 instruction and material development.",,10.21203/rs.3.rs-72116/v1,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-72116/v1,forward

 By adopting a pre- and post-test design, the current study longitudinally examined the complex relationship between two different dimensions of phonological vocabulary knowledge (declarative vs. automatized) and their ultimate impacts on global L2 listening proficiency among 133 Japanese EFL students. The declarative group focused solely on what target words sound like and mean via meaning recognition tasks. The automatization group worked not only on such form-meaning mappings but also on prompt access to the target words in a semantically, collocationally, and grammatically appropriate manner via lexicosemantic judgment tasks. Compared to the declarative group, the automatization group showed relatively robust learning in both declarative and automatized dimensions of target words. Although neither training approach showed clear superiority, the results suggest that relative gains in automatized, rather than declarative, dimensions are associated with enhanced L2 listening proficiency. The distinction between declarative and automatized dimensions of phonological vocabulary knowledge, along with the absence of a direct link between training type and improved listening proficiency, offers valuable insights for future extension studies.",,10.1017/s0142716424000468,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0142716424000468,forward

This study examined the effect of task complexity in the learning of request-making expressions. Task complexity was operationalized as [+/− reasoning] following Robinson's framework. The study employed a pretest-posttest research design and was conducted over 6 weeks. Korean junior high school students from 3 classes ( N = 73) were assigned to one of the following groups: simple, complex, or control. Both task groups performed a pretest, 2 collaborative tasks, and 2 posttests, whereas the control group performed the pre- and posttests only. Learners' oral interaction during tasks was audiorecorded and analyzed by the number of pragmatic-related episodes (PREs). Learners' knowledge of request expressions was measured by a discourse completion test (DCT). The results indicated that task complexity levels influenced the occurrence of PREs, but no difference was found in the quality of task outcome between the simple and complex groups. In terms of learning outcomes, both task groups outperformed the control group, but no difference was found on the immediate posttest. However, the complex group maintained its gain on the delayed posttest. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",,10.1111/MODL.12273,https://doi.org/10.1111/MODL.12273,forward

Over a 16-week course, input delivered through video clips was enhanced differently in four intact classes: (1) metapragmatic explanation (n = 21), (2) form-comparison (n = 21), (3) typographically enhanced input along with input flooding (n = 25) and (4) meaning-focused (n = 28). The four treatment groups were compared with a control group (n = 15) on pre-test and post-test performance, each test comprising two production tasks: leaving a message on an answerphone and sending an email. The results revealed that the treatment groups improved on the post-test in comparison to the pre-test, outperforming the control group. Although this improvement was significant for all four treatment groups on the email task, the form-comparison and the metapragmatic explanation groups performed significantly better than the other two treatment groups on the answerphone task. This study proposes that pedagogic treatment in this area of research is better operationalised by degree of input enhancement than by dichotomies such as explicit versus implicit or deductive versus inductive learning.",,10.1080/09571736.2014.972431,https://doi.org/10.1080/09571736.2014.972431,forward

A total 59 participants, consisting of 34 females and 29 males, were categorized into groups based on their exposure to the target language and proficiency. The results show that the reliability of the test reaches ?=.798 which means it is acceptable for a language test. Further development of test items is required to achieve more adequate test reliability. The findings also suggest that learners' pragmatic knowledge can be influenced by both study-abroad experience and linguistic competence. These factors may contribute to learners' ability to appropriately respond to pragmatic utterances from the test. Thus, language learners should focus on increasing their linguistic proficiency to enhance their understanding and use of pragmatic language. This study underscores the importance of designing effective language pragmatic tests that incorporate a variety of pragmatics components and comprehensive instruments to achieve the desired test reliability and validity.",,10.30998/scope.v8i1.17418,https://doi.org/10.30998/scope.v8i1.17418,forward

Mostafa Morady Moghaddam,2024.0,Troubles talk and complaints in teacher-student interactions,"
 Expressions of dissatisfaction are made either through troubles talk or complaints (Haugh, 2016). Against this backdrop, through the analysis of naturally occurring data in classroom interactions, this paper explores Iranian university students’ troubles talk and complaints, and how teachers reacted to them. The study’s findings reveal that female students generated more cases of troubles talk, whereas male students complained more in their interactions with teachers. In reaction to troubles talk, female teachers’ affiliative responses drastically outnumbered male ones, whereas in reaction to complaints, male teachers’ disaffiliative responses largely outnumbered female ones. The conclusion is that gender differences and the appraisal of the expression of dissatisfaction as troubles talk or a complaint play a pivotal role in teachers’ responses. In this study’s institutional context, complaints were not welcomed by the teachers, in that they linked students’ expressions of dissatisfaction to low self-efficacy or subjective judgment of teachers’ performance. This study highlights the importance of local contexts and practices in understanding the nature of complicated speech acts such as complaints.",,10.1163/18773109-01602004,https://doi.org/10.1163/18773109-01602004,forward

While this method helps distinguishing statistically significant effects from the nonsignificant ones, it does not help achieving the higher goal of accurately estimating the actual size of those effects in an intended study. Adopting an open-science approach, this article presents an alternative approach, accuracy in effect size estimation (AESE), to sample size planning that ensures that researchers obtain adequately narrow confidence intervals (CI) for their effect sizes of interest thereby ensuring accuracy in estimating the actual size of those effects. Specifically, I (a) compare the underpinnings of power-analytic and AESE methods, (b) provide a practical definition of narrow CIs, (c) apply the AESE method to various research studies from L2 literature, and (d) offer several flexible R programs to implement the methods discussed in this article.",,10.1017/S0272263120000017,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263120000017,forward

The investigation focuses on learners' ability to soften the illocutionary force of request utterances by employing a range of external modifiers. Data for the present investigation were elicited at three distinct points of the learners' sojourn in the target language environment: shortly after their arrival, in the middle of their stay and shortly before they returned home to Germany. The data were collected with the help of the Multimedia Elicitation Task (MET) which had been specifically designed for the present study. The MET is a computer based instrument that contains 16 request scenarios. The study examines whether learners varied the use of external modifiers according to the status of their interlocutors and/or the imposition of the request. It also investigates whether their choice of modifiers over time seems to have been influenced by exposure to their L2 in the study abroad context by comparing the data of the German learners of English in England to data collected from 13 German learners of English in Germany with no study abroad experience and also to 15 British English native speakers.",,10.1515/IP.2007.011,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP.2007.011,forward

The second is to find out the types of illocutionary acts which are dominantly expressed in Akeelah and The Bee movie. The last is to identify the types of sentences of indirect speech acts to represent the five types of illocutionary acts. To achieve these objectives, a pragmatic analysis was implemented. Therefore, the research used the theory of speech acts proposed by Yule (2014). The data collected through a purposive sampling, a corpus (transcript of the movie), and a movie. In the three conflict storylines process of data analysis was started by watching the movie and reading the whole script. The next is classifying the data based on the types of illocutionary acts proposed by Yule and the last step was interpreting the data based on the contextual meaning of the utterances from the characters. As a result, three points of conclusions are concluded. The first, the classifications of illocutionary acts found were directive, representative, commissive, and expressive. The second, the most dominant types of illocutionary acts were representative and expressive (37%), the middle was directive (27%), and the less was commissive (9%).

One-hundred-twenty-one L1-Mandarin learners of English as a second language completed a regulatory focus questionnaire and a discourse completion task focusing on two types of speech acts: request and opinion. Multiple regression results showed that learners’ promotion focus, concerned with advancement, growth, accomplishments, positively predicted their pragmatic production in general, and especially in situations where the learner is subject to a higher degree of imposition, has lower power and is socially distant from the interlocutor. On the other hand, the prevention focus, which is concerned with safety, security, and calmness, negatively predicted pragmatic production, especially in those situations. The findings provide support for the role of motivational dispositions in the level of learners’ L2 pragmatic competence.

The sample involved 96 B.A. and M.A. Iranian EFL learners and 10 native speakers of English. A Discourse Completion Test (DCT) was used to generate data related to the request strategies used by each group. The selection of request situations in the DCT was based on 2 social factors of relative power and social distance. Although the results revealed pragmatic development, particularly in the movement from direct to conventionally indirect strategies on the part of the EFL learners, the EFL learners with higher proficiency displayed overuse of indirect type of requesting, whereas the native group was characterized by the more balanced use of this strategy. The lower proficiency EFL learners, on the other hand, overused the most direct strategy type. In terms of the influence of the social variables, the findings of this research revealed that as far as social power is concerned, the EFL learners displayed closer performance to the native speakers. But considering social distance, it seems that the Iranian EFL learners had not acquired sufficient sociopragmatic knowledge to display proper social behavior.",,10.4304/JLTR.2.4.790-803,https://doi.org/10.4304/JLTR.2.4.790-803,forward

It was also found that the participants receiving explicit pragmatic instruction outperformed the implicit and control groups. Moreover, the two Collaborative Translation Task (CTT) groups showed better retention of pragmatic knowledge.

Results of the pre-tests were indicative of the groups’ parallel performance on the three sub-strategies of direct, conventionally indirect and non-conventionally indirect requests at both levels of awareness and production. Despite the relatively equal performance of learners at both groups in the pre-test, following the instructional phase, participants in the experimental group exhibited a significant improvement in their awareness and production of requests. This finding was apparent in the significant decrease of direct request strategies in their post-test productions; furthermore regarding the notion of “point of view operation” in requests, members of both groups in the pre-test displayed a high frequency in the utilization of “hearer-oriented requests”; however the experimental group in the post-test relied heavily on the “speaker-oriented” request strategies. With regard to internal and external modifications results evinced high proportion of these strategies in participants’ responses in the pre-test. Inappropriate application of this strategy was seen in several situations in the DCT responses of both groups.

"Younis Salih Fatah, Noor Mala Bt Ibrahim",2020.0,The Importance of Utilizing Pragmatics in EFL/ESL Context,"
 Pragmatics research in the last few years has gained eminence under the impact of Soler and the succeeding paradigms of Communicative Competence. Amid the diverse components of communicative competence, a great number of L2 studies have attended to the concept of pragmatic competence, that deals with both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic knowledge. Hence, pragmatics interlanguage research is concerned with the pragmatic competence and pragmatic performance of L2 learners; though, teaching pragmatics to Non-native Speakers, particularly EFL learners, is a prickly subject. Hence, pragmatic competence has been noticeably absent from ELT curricula, notwithstanding the fact that it has been guaranteed a place in diverse models of Communicative competence. This is mainly due to the hindrances of teaching and learning pragmatics in the ESL/EFL classes. Hence, the study primarily aims at discoursing challenges and lacunas in teaching and learning pragmatics within the confines of EFL classrooms drawing on the existing published literature and proffers recommendations to overcome these problems. Thus, the paper concentrates on these central and prominent fields: the EFL/ESL setting, ELT materials, and available to teach learners, teacher competence, and evaluating pragmatic ability.",,10.21203/rs.3.rs-22375/v1,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-22375/v1,forward

Ten EFL pre-service English teachers in teacher education programs were purposively selected via homogeneous sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect the data. The results revealed that although most pre-service teachers consider sociolinguistic instruction important, they feel that they did not have adequate sociolinguistic competence, and that they lack confidence in teaching sociolinguistic skills. These pre-service teachers’ self-reported inadequate sociolinguistic competence and low confidence in teaching sociolinguistic skills could be attributed to such sociocultural factors as time constraints, exam-driven teaching culture, and insufficient exposure to the target language culture, as well as materials deprived of authentic pragmatic content. The study concludes with major findings, pedagogical implications and suggestions for future research.",,10.48185/TTS.V2I2.219,https://doi.org/10.48185/TTS.V2I2.219,forward

Consciousness-raising tasks are designed. Accordingly, this study was done to investigate the effect of consciousness-raising instruction on the pragmatic development of agreeing and disagreeing of Iranian EFL upper intermediate learners in speaking performance. To fulfill the purpose of this study, on the basis of the result of English Unlimited Placement Test, 60 male and female upper intermediate EFL learners, aged 17 to 23, were selected out of 70. The participants were divided in two experimental and control groups. The experimental group was divided into three sub- groups including a role play group, a discussion group, and an interactive translation group. Each experimental group received different treatment on speaking performance. The way they were treated in these three experimental groups varied. This research was conducted at two English institutes located in Karaj, namely, Negarin and Zaban Tarjoman Language Centers. The study lasted for one term (i.e., 16 sessions). The quantitative data obtained were analyzed through SPSS to scrutinize the effect of the treatment. The results of a repeated-measures two-way ANOVA showed that there was a significant improvement in Iranian EFL learners’ application of agreement and disagreement structures while speaking. Meanwhile, in the control group the improvement was not statistically significant. Conclusions and Pedagogical implications are further discussed.",,10.36097/rsan.v0i36.1016,https://doi.org/10.36097/rsan.v0i36.1016,forward

The data were collected from a discourse completion test (DCT). Their requestive behaviour is studied in three social and power hierarchical situations (low–high, equal–equal and high–low) in the university context and is compared with a group of native Cantonese speakers' (NCSs) and native English speakers' (NESs) requestive behaviour, respectively. The dual comparison results in three important findings. First, the evidence shows some L1 influence on the syntactic structure of the CLEs' query preparatory strategy. The equivalent interrogative form of (Nei1/Ngo5) ho2 ji5/h2 m ho2 ji5: (you/I) can/can-not-can in Cantonese and Can/Could/May you/I …? in English contributes to the frequent use of the CLEs' indirect requestive behaviour in English. Nevertheless, the difference in direct and indirect strategies between the two groups is significant (p < 0.005). Second, there is cross-cultural agreement on indirect requestive behaviour in the three situations between the CLEs and the NESs. Both groups use the politeness marker of cing2 or please to mitigate imposition and increase politeness. However, the CLEs demonstrate limited pragmalinguistic resources to enhance the force and politeness of the speech act compared to the NESs. The strengths and weaknesses of CLEs' requestive behaviour, their limited pragmalinguistic resources and the limitations of the study are discussed.",,10.1515/mult.2011.005,https://doi.org/10.1515/mult.2011.005,forward

Mitigated devices refer to linguistic strategies employed to soften or moderate speech acts, such as hedging, mitigation, and indirectness, which play a crucial role in effective communication. Understanding the connection between language proficiency and mitigated devices usage among Saudi learners not only contributes to the field of linguistics but also holds significance for cross-cultural communication and education. It provided insights into the challenges faced by learners and offers guidance for fostering more culturally sensitive and effective communication strategies. To achieve this aim, 98 Saudi learners took part in this study from PSAU by replying on the Discourse Completion Test. Findings showed a significant influence of language proficiency on using internal modifications devices. Regarding the influence of social variables, advanced learners were more conscious of the effect of social power and distance in altering their strategy depending on the contextual variables. The study concluded with practical recommendations for learners, educators, and policymakers to improve language proficiency and intercultural communication competence among Saudi learners. These recommendations aimed to facilitate more effective and contextually appropriate communication in academic, professional, and social settings.",,10.58256/rjah.v4i3.1324,https://doi.org/10.58256/rjah.v4i3.1324,forward

A set of pragmatic awareness questionnaire and discourse completion tasks were administered as the data collection instruments and an eclectic design was adopted to analyze the effects of the instruction regarding their pragmatic awareness and production. The results indicate that explicit pragmatic instruction provided positive effects for raising the level of pragmatic awareness in the low group. Additionally, both the intermediate and low groups showed a significant improvement in production, as confirmed by the examination between and within subjects, and also displayed a range of formulaic expressions with a less idiosyncrasy attributed to first language transfer.

The present study investigates the congratulation strategies of Pakistani English as second language (ESL) learners and British English speakers under the influence of social distance variable. A quantitative approach is applied in the analysis with the frequency of strategies (semantic formulas) being numerically analyzed. The current study recruited 120 participants, and who were further divided into four different groups: 30 British English speakers, 30 Pakistani ESL learners in the elite class, 30 Pakistani ESL learners of the middle class, and 30 Pakistani ESL learners in the lower class. For data collection, a discourse completion test (DCT) was used as a tool. The findings reveal that the most frequently used types of congratulation strategy are illocutionary force indicating device (IFID) followed by overlapped strategies (a combination of two), an offer of a good wish, expression of happiness, request for information, encouragement, expression of surprise, and suggestion of celebration , while other types of strategies are not used by the participants. The study reveals the existence of crosscultural differences in the use of congratulations by Pakistani ESL learners. The findings further show how the middle and lower class of Pakistani ESL learners use a more elaborated form of compliment responses (CRs) as compared to Pakistani ESL learners of elite and British English speakers.

E. Kotorova,2021.0,Methodology of Cross-Cultural Description of Speech Behaviour: A Case Study of INVITATION in German and Russian Discourse,"The article aims to demonstrate a consistent methodology for conducting cross-cultural research of verbal communication behaviour and identifying its peculiarities in different language cultures. First of all, the author discusses the problem of defining a basic unit of communication crucial for the analysis of communicative behaviour and proposes her own interpretation of such a unit called speech behaviour pattern (SBP). The illocutionary content and general organization of any SBP is considered universal, while their actual realization in a language is culturally conditioned and therefore may vary significantly in different languages. Utterances that constitute a certain SBP are organized into a field with a prototypical centre and a gradationally formed periphery, which is referred to as communicative-pragmatic field (CPF). The proposed methodology of contrastive analysis includes the following four major components: 1) definition of illocutionary purpose, 2) description of structural forms of SBP (i.e., their lexical and grammatical characteristics), 3) identifying communicative-pragmatic factors, 4) description of the structure and hierarchy of the communicative-pragmatic field that includes utterances implementing SBP. The presented approach is then consistently applied to the analysis of the SBP of invitation in the Russian and German discourse. The language data are taken from the existing Russian and German corpora. The proposed methodology helps to identify the main similarities and differences in the implementation of the SBP invitation in Russian and German driven by grammatical and communicative-pragmatic factors.",,10.17576/GEMA-2021-2101-01,https://doi.org/10.17576/GEMA-2021-2101-01,forward

The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effect of a period of immersion in the target language community on the pragmatic development of foreign language learners of French in the area of apologies. The study, thus, adds to the scarce body of literature on pragmatic development in general and on the pragmatics of French as an L2 in particular. The participants in this longitudinal study are seven Austrian learners of French who studied at the Université de Montréal in Quebec for a period of ten months. Base-line data elicited from native speakers (NSs) of Quebecois French and NSs of Austrian German are also analyzed. The methods of data collection include a four-item discourse completion task designed to elicit the speech act of apology and a questionnaire completed before and after the year abroad. The analysis reveals that while some aspects of apologetic behavior approximate the Quebecois French NS norm over time spent in the target language community (e.g., decrease of Justifications), other aspects remain unaffected by the exposure (e.g., frequency of IFIDs) or even shift away from the L2 norm (e.g., increase in the use of two upgraders). Overall, a coexistence of target-like and non-target-like developments was observed in the data. Moreover, many of the features investigated were found to develop in a non-linear—rather than linear—fashion. It is, therefore, suggested that future studies in the field take a more dynamic perspective in order to obtain a fuller understanding of the path of pragmatic development.",,10.1515/IP.2007.012,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP.2007.012,forward

"Luke Plonsky, D.

Unfortunately, however, second language (L2) researchers often fail to report and even more often fail to interpret reliability estimates beyond generic benchmarks for acceptability. As a means to guide interpretations of such estimates, this article meta-analyzes reliability coefficients (internal consistency, interrater, and intrarater) as reported in published L2 research. We recorded 2,244 reliability estimates in 537 individual articles along with study (e.g., sample size) and instrument features (e.g., item formats) proposed to influence reliability. We also coded for the indices employed (e.g., alpha, KR20). The coefficients were then aggregated (i.e., meta-analyzed). The three types of reliability varied, with internal consistency as the lowest: median = .82. Interrater and intrarater estimates were substantially higher (.92 and .95, respectively). Overall estimates were also found to vary according to study and instrument features such as proficiency (low = .79, intermediate = .84, advanced = .89) and target skill (e.g., writing = .88 vs. listening = .77). We use our results to inform and encourage interpretations of reliability estimates relative to the larger field as well as to the substantive and methodological features particular to individual studies and subdomains.

Jie Huang,2014.0,Intercultural Pragmatics,"The purpose of this study is to investigate how viewers who speak different languages interpret cinematographic metaphors in a filmic advertisement. The study is organized in three parts: First, we offer a theoretical model that predicts the offline mental mechanisms that occur while people interpret filmic metaphors, based on an existingmodel of visualmetaphor processing. Second, we evaluate the model in a think-aloud retrospective task. A TV-commercial is projected individually to 30 Spanish, 30 American, and 30 Persian participants, who are then asked to verbalize their thoughts. The commercial was previously segmented, analyzed using FILMIP (Filmic Metaphor Identification Procedure), and marked for metaphoricity by two independent analysts. The collected data is then evaluated in two formal content analyses. In the first one, two independent coders classified all the clauses used by the 90 participants in relation to the steps outlined in the theoretical model. In the second analysis, those clauses in which the participants were constructing their metaphorical interpretation of the filmic advertisement were annotated for the type of metaphor they constructed. The general results show that: (1) somemental processes seem to bemore prominent in some cultures and not in others, and (2) genre-related knowledge plays a crucial role in constructing filmic metaphors in certain cultures and not in others. With this study, we theoretically formalize and empirically test the types of operations reflected in the language that viewers use to describe how they interpret filmic metaphors, thus advancing the current theory and methods on filmic metaphor interpretation from cognitive, semiotic, and cross-cultural perspectives.",,10.1080/07268602.2014.884914,https://doi.org/10.1080/07268602.2014.884914,forward
"Michael Haugh, W. Chang",2015.0,Understanding im/politeness across cultures: an interactional approach to raising sociopragmatic awareness,"Abstract Politeness is an important aspect of communication, particularly across cultures where misunderstandings can have very negative relational consequences. Yet while various approaches to politeness in the context of second language learning have been developed, such approaches have either been largely atheoretical in their conceptualisation of politeness or have employed models that do not adequately capture participant understandings of politeness across cultures. In this paper, it is argued that an approach encompassing participant understandings of politeness is a more appropriate starting point for raising sociopragmatic awareness about im/politeness across languages and cultures. An interactional approach whereby raising pragmalinguistic awareness about the interactional achievement of particular meanings and actions in interaction is combined with raising sociopragmatic awareness about what underlies evaluations of those meanings and actions as im/polite is advocated. It is argued that raising sociopragmatic awareness in this way provides learners with the means to analyse differences between the politeness systems of their first and second languages, thereby allowing them to make more informed choices in regards to both constituting their L2 identities as well as their relationships with others.",,10.1515/iral-2015-0018,https://doi.org/10.1515/iral-2015-0018,forward

To this end, this study reviewed publications in the field of virtual-agent-based language learning research from 2012 to 2022 in the Web of Science SSCI Core Collection database and explored the dimensions of publication trends, country and regional distribution, participants, research methodology, research platforms, role of virtual agents, language proficiency, research hot topics, theoretical foundations, and hot issues and trends in the field of virtual-agent-based language learning research. Cluster and co-occurrence analysis using VOSviewer software was used to analyze the links among country and region distribution, keywords, and terms. It was found that (1) the top four regions in terms of the number of citations for authors were, in descending order, Iran, Japan, South Korea, and Brazil; (2) the learner characteristics that scholars were most concerned about were learning effectiveness, memory performance, social presence, learning experience, and motivation; and (3) the results of co-occurrence analyses classified virtual-agent-based language learning research into eight clusters, namely, anthropomorphic virtual agents, the effects produced by virtual agents, the social interaction of virtual agents, animated virtual agents and language achievement, the gestures of virtual agents, the effects of virtual agents on learner characteristics, computer-assisted learning, and the design of virtual agents.

The present study examines request perspective, the least researched form of mitigation in requesting, while focusing on a type of request characterized by a strong preference for speaker perspective in English and for hearer perspective in most other languages researched to date. It examines requests produced by 900 speakers from nine different (inter)language groups: five groups of native speakers (English, German, Greek, Polish and Russian) and four groups of advanced learners of English as a foreign language (German, Greek, Polish and Russian L1s).
While our learners used more conventionally indirect forms than did the native speakers of the respective L1s, showing awareness of this English pragmatic norm, they retained a preference for the hearer perspective. These results suggest reliance on pragmatic universals as an alternative explanation to pragmatic transfer, also illustrating the need to address less salient pragmatic features in English language teaching.",,10.1163/26660393-bja10003,https://doi.org/10.1163/26660393-bja10003,forward

A total of 52 university students from various majors participated in the study. The treatment was given for nine weeks during the regular class hours in terms of four speech acts, compliments, apologies, requests, and refusals, with the goal of enhancing the learners’ pragmatic awareness as well as pragmatic competence. A questionnaire and the learners’ reflection journals were adopted as data collection instruments, and an eclectic design was adopted to analyze their perception. Both the intermediate and low groups showed positive perception in terms of the four major categories—interest, usefulness, importance, and motivation, yet more than half of the learners from the low group found that learning L2 pragmatics was difficult due to the complexity and length of some of the sentence patterns of formulaic expressions. Further, there were significant differences between subjects regarding the category of difficulty for each speech act. Nevertheless, the learners expressed that pragmatic instruction facilitated their communication skills, enhanced their pragmatic awareness on intercultural differences, as well as instilled confidence in English interactions. These findings imply learners’ motivation and needs for learning L2 pragmatic features.",,10.17507/TPLS.0603.02,https://doi.org/10.17507/TPLS.0603.02,forward
H.

Subsequent meta-analysts, however, have uncritically followed the methodological choices made by Norris and Ortega. This paper suggests a critical reevaluation of the methodological procedures underlying the Norris and Ortega (2000) meta-analysis. I reexamined their procedures, and reassessed the 49 unique samples they used in their meta-analysis. In doing so, I identified three key methodological limitations with the study, pertaining, respectively, to (a) the data collection procedure, (b) the coding system, and (c) the statistical analysis. I argue that the lack of data quality inherent in the primary studies, the oversimplified coding scheme, and the inappropriate use of effect size statistics combine to compromise the validity of the conclusions Norris and Ortega have drawn from their meta-analysis. I subsequently provide alternative procedures which may yield a more empirically sound research synthesis, recommending, for future meta-analysts, the „best evidence synthesis‟ approach where conclusions are drawn from combining quantitative and qualitative analyses.",,10.7916/D84M9H5B,https://doi.org/10.7916/D84M9H5B,forward

To a certain extent the resulting impact this has in relation to key issues such as the ownership of English has also been recognised. Description of the linguistic consequences of this shift however is less established, and lingua franca corpora are still in their relatively early stages of development, though growing in momentum. This paper will contribute to the emerging body of work that does report on empirical studies in the field, drawing on two corpora of naturally occurring lingua franca interactions which have been gathered for PhD projects at King's College London. To date reported ELF research projects have tended to focus separately on one or other linguistic system, on phonology (e.g. Jenkins 2000; 2005), and to a lesser extent on pragmatics (e.g. House 1999), and on lexicogrammatical features (cf Seidlhofer 2004). The focus of this paper is to report on findings in both pragmatics and lexicogrammar, and in so doing to identify the interrelationship between the two systems and highlight ways in which they are mutually constitutive. The paper aims to show how pragmatic motives can lead to changes in the lexis and grammar, and in turn how lexicogrammatical innovations impact on pragmatic norms and strategies.",,10.35360/NJES.12,https://doi.org/10.35360/NJES.12,forward

Paula Garcia,2004.0,Developmental Differences in Speech Act Recognition: A Pragmatic Awareness Study,"With the growing acknowledgement of the importance of pragmatic competence in second language (L2) learning, language researchers have identified the comprehension of speech acts as they occur in natural conversation as essential to communicative competence (e.g. Bardovi-Harlig, 2001; Thomas, 1983). Nonconventional indirect speech acts are formed in a variety of ways by native English speakers and are therefore not easily recognised by non-native English speakers (Cook & Liddicoat, 2002; Kasper, 1984). In order to investigate this aspect of pragmatic comprehension, this study compared the pragmatic awareness of low and high ability L2 learners and native English speakers by examining each group's ability to recognise indirect speech acts as they occurred in a corpus of conversations taking place in academic settings. Participants (n = 56) identified requests, suggestions, corrections, and offers with varying success. Results show that contextual knowledge and linguistic features, such as specified agent, lexical markers, false starts, and use of modals, may have interacted with speech act type to account for performance variability. This information can be used by language teachers to raise English language learners' awareness of how pragmatic meaning is conveyed.",,10.1080/09658410408667089,https://doi.org/10.1080/09658410408667089,forward

Therefore, this study sought to investigate the extent of English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers' metapragmatic awareness and their instruction of pragmatic features. To achieve this goal, a 30-item questionnaire was adapted and administered to 300 EFL teachers and analyzed in terms of the four components of the questionnaire, including Language teachers, Language learners, Colleagues and institutes, and Coursebooks and exams. Moreover, the classes of 30 teachers were observed based on a 20-item observation checklist that was developed by the researchers and analyzed qualitatively. Results indicated that the teachers' awareness of pragmatics was relatively high only in one of the components of pragmatic awareness, namely language teachers. However, observation results indicated that they did not consistently teach pragmatic features in their classes. In addition, it was revealed that, except for the component of Language teachers, the differences between less and more experienced teachers' mean scores on the other components of pragmatic awareness questionnaire were not statistically significant. The low levels of awareness and corresponding practice could be attributed to the fact that meager attention is devoted to pragmatic instruction in teaching education programs.",,10.22132/TEL.2020.118261,https://doi.org/10.22132/TEL.2020.118261,forward

Methodologically, the study is largely based on the Bardovi-Harlig & Dörnyei (1998) study on pragmatic awareness. However, unlike the former, it does not compare SL and FL learners, but two groups of SL learners with different length of residence in Greece. Hence, it attempts to reach conclusions with respect to the impact of residence on the development of pragmatic awareness. It is shown that both learner groups consistently recognise grammatical violations with greater frequency than pragmatic ones and rate the former as more severe than the latter. It is concluded that for this particular learner sample, length of residence alone is not a sufficient condition for the development of pragmatic awareness. The suggestion is made that this is due at least partly to the special circumstances of the participants, which do not allow for sufficient opportunities for social contact with native speakers. The conclusions have important implications both for the role of the L2 setting in pragmatic development and for language instruction.",,10.1515/mult.2012.001,https://doi.org/10.1515/mult.2012.001,forward

We then suggest a methodological procedure through which such a typology can be employed in applied linguistic inquiries. Finally, we describe a case study featuring irritations faced by Chinese learners of English when it comes to extracting oneself from an interaction while the other keeps on talking.

To do so, a web-based software, called a Computerized Dynamic Assessment of Speech Acts, Routines, and Implicatures (CDASRI), accessible at http://da-pragmatics.com, was developed. Then, 137 upper-intermediate or advanced high school and university students ranging in age from 16 to 36 from two provinces of Khorasan Razavi and Golestan, Iran, were selected based on convenience sampling, who voluntarily took part in the study. Based on how many hints or mediations were used by each test-taker, the CDASRI provided three scores: actual score (traditional score), mediated score, and learning potential score (LPS). The results of the study indicated that the test could improve test takers’ pragmatic comprehension competence. Moreover, the significant difference between the mediated (using hints) and actual (without hints) scores of learners accounted for the fact that because of test-takers’ different Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) levels, their level of responsiveness to mediation was significantly different from one another. Hence, it can be concluded that traditional non-dynamic test loses sight of a big part of learners’ abilities through neglecting learners’ potentialities and putting emphasis only on their preliminary performance.

This instrument consists of situational scenarios purposefully designed to make participants elicit specific pragmatic data in controlled situations (Kasper & Youn 2017, Félix-Brasdefer 2018). Notwithstanding the widespread use of role-plays, some drawbacks have been identified concerning design (Hudson et al. 1995, Trosborg 1995, Youn 2015) and real-life consequences (Al-Gahtani & Roever 2012). Against this backdrop, this study presents a learner-centred approach to design situational scenarios based on participants’ examples of complaint situations. Specifically, an exemplar generation task and a likelihood questionnaire (Jianda 2006a, 2006b) were used to elaborate the role-play task. The study reports on the implementation of the learner-centred approach and its effectiveness to construct a role-play task. Furthermore, using retrospective verbal reports, this study discusses whether participants’ engagement in the design of the role-play task encouraged them to act out the situations, as they would do it in real-life contexts. The study evidences the usefulness of adopting a learner-centred approach to design the role-play task.

In particular, it concerned whether such preference is influenced by two learner variables, namely, foreign language enjoyment (FLE) and proficiency level. The preference for selective vs. comprehensive WCF was also examined. The participants in the study were 117 University students in a Thai EFL context. Analysis of questionnaire data revealed a tendency for learners to prefer more explicit types of WCF (i.e., metalinguistic explanation and overt correction) for most error types, irrespective of their proficiency and FLE level. High proficiency level learners rated less explicit WCF types (i.e., underlining and error code) as useful to some degree, whereas their low proficiency level counterparts did not. Similar results were found for the two FLE groups. Besides, the FLE level seemed to play a role in perceiving the value of WCF in terms of scope. The results of follow-up interviews showed that the linguistic features of learners' first language, existing knowledge of the target language, affective feelings, and teacher's role were the main factors contributing to variation in learners' preferences. Possible pedagogical implications are discussed.",,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.660564,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.660564,forward

They completed morphological awareness measurements (morpheme segmentation, morpheme analysis and homophone awareness), cognate awareness measurements that tapped into three different types of bilingual cognates, as well as two word-learning measurements (definitional knowledge and lexical inference). Drawing upon multivariate regression analysis, the study demonstrated that cognate awareness contributed to L2 Japanese word learning. Awareness of false cognates yielded stronger predictions in both outcome measurements. Regarding morphological awareness, the study indicated that morphological awareness had a unique contribution to L2 Japanese word learning above and beyond cognate awareness. More specifically, the findings underscored the importance of morpheme analysis and homophone awareness in Japanese word learning.",,10.1080/13670050.2022.2157203,https://doi.org/10.1080/13670050.2022.2157203,forward
Yunita Uswatun Khasanah,2019.0,A Pragmatic Analysis of Efl Learners’ Social Media Interaction,"As a new and emerging venue of interaction, social media provide an ample opportunity for EFL learners to practice their English mastery and to enhance their socio-pragmatic awareness. However, even though some social media attempt to accommodate and mimic offline communications through their features, there are still technological and platform affordance and constraints that limit what users can do to get their message across. This situation makes a pragmatic analysis of online communication using offline measure a naïve endeavor. To confirm this notion, this paper borrows concepts from relevance theory pertaining to L1 and L2 pragmatics to reveal the patterns of online communication of 43 EFL learners in their social media interaction. The results show that there is a different pattern between online and offline interaction where they share a non-prototypical model of communication, the process of context and meaning construction, as well as their attempt to compensate for what the platform is lacking in accommodating their communication need.",,10.18860/jetle.v1i1.7751,https://doi.org/10.18860/jetle.v1i1.7751,forward

The result shows that there are two main effects and an interactional effect. This research particularly focuses on the development of modal words which function as aggravating and mitigating the argument in academic writing. The participants for this research were undergraduate students who were taking an ESL writing course as a requirement. In the immediate-post test, students in the experimental group, who received explicit instruction on modality, use significantly outperformed the students in the control group, who received zero treatment.

In the Valencian Community in Spain, the coexistence of Spanish and Catalan as co-official languages and English as a foreign language, which is learned as a third language (L3), shapes a unique multilingual setting. This study examined the extent to which multilingual learners’ use of two interpersonal pragmatic markers (PMs), i.e., hedges (e.g., I believe) and attitude markers (e.g., fortunately), is related across languages and whether the relationship changes over time. Participants were 313 Spanish-Catalan bilingual high school learners of L3 English. They wrote three opinion essays over one academic year in the three languages of instruction: Spanish, Catalan, and English. Quantitative results revealed a trend towards stronger correlations over time in both PMs. At Time 3, correlations were statistically significant for all language pairs in hedges and for two language pairs in attitude markers (Spanish and Catalan, Spanish and English). Qualitative analyses of the learners’ essays lend support to these results and show transfer at the phrase and discourse-level.",,10.1075/ap.20024.mar,https://doi.org/10.1075/ap.20024.mar,forward

A Discourse Completion Task (DCT) including request and apology speech acts was used to measure the gains in the two groups. The DCT was administered one at the beginning as a pre-test and then at the end of the six months course as a post-test. Overall, the study revealed significant development in study abroad learners’ pragmatic knowledge, whereas this change in at home group was meager.

"Y. Cho, J. Jung, M. Park",2013.0,Pedagogical Scenarios for Teaching Topic/Nominative Marking in Discourse,"
 Based on an error analysis of KFL learners' use of the topic marker (TM) and the nominative marker (NM), we will identify sources of common errors, define their semantically accurate and pragmatically appropriate uses within a pedagogical grammar of Korean, and then propose a series of pedagogical scenarios that facilitate acquisition of these markers. Most of the errors occurred in extended stretches of discourse rather than in isolated sentences, indicating that teaching discourse markers crucially needs pragmatic strategies that highlight target features in lieu of sentence-level, syntactic approaches. Linguistic analyses of the TM/NM in Korean have often treated them as analogous to their Japanese counterparts (Sohn, 1980); only recently have there been attempts to clarify important differences between the TM/NM in the two languages (E. Lee & Shimojo, 2011). Moreover, Korean pedagogical grammar treats the TM as: (1) a topic marker, (2) a contrastive marker, and (3) a marker of emphasis, and the NM as a subject marker, in much more simplistic terms Japanese pedagogical grammar (Noda, 1996). We propose that TM/NM (and bare nouns and zero pronominais) be taught in more concrete contexts with clear explanations of their discourse characteristics through activities designed to highlight their intended meanings and purposes. We believe that discourse marking should be introduced spirally along strategic points all the way up to advanced levels to reinforce its uses in complex structures and expand the learner's pragmatic repertoire of more subtle and interactional meanings.",,10.2307/korelangamer.18.2013.0040,https://doi.org/10.2307/korelangamer.18.2013.0040,forward

This involved the use of semiauthentic discourse samples of New Zealand English to raise the pragmatic awareness of trainee interpreters in an undergraduate course taught by the first author. The researchers analysed qualitative data from learner blogs, written during instruction as part of the course requirements, for evidence that the learners noticed paralinguistic features used for pragmatic effect in conversations they overheard or took part in outside the classroom. The class teacher also kept a reflective journal recording her observations on learner progress and the usefulness of the materials. The researchers found there was a growth in the number of learners noticing pragmatic features during tuition, suggesting that the semiauthentic samples were effective as learning tools. Use of these samples also facilitated the noticing and discussion of cross-cultural differences and enabled more learner-centered methodology to be used.",,10.1002/TESJ.7,https://doi.org/10.1002/TESJ.7,forward

Specifically it is set up to trace how far novice non-native speakers of English are able to utilise the generic components and politeness strategies of the target language that strongly correlate with communicative success in social interactions. A corpus of 90 job application letters written by 90 job applicants was collected and analysed within the move structure analysis proposed by Bhatia (1993) and the framework of Brown and Levinson's (1987) model of politeness. The results indicate that politeness strategies are inappropriately utilised and the genre components are poorly managed in the letters of applications. The letters reflect particular strategic moves that are not usually utilised by English native speakers. The bilingual writers tend to avoid negative politeness but make frequent inappropriate use of positive politeness strategies due to their ignorance of the social-cultural constraints governing their selection. This suggests a difference based on areas of cultural transfer rather than on a language effect. We hope the results of this study will be of help to foreign language instructors in increasing their students' consciousness of cross-cultural preferences, the essential genre specific meaning components and appropriate pragmatic strategies in order to write in a manner that is acceptable to native speakers of the target language.",,10.1080/13670050608668633,https://doi.org/10.1080/13670050608668633,forward

Anders Myrset,2021.0,Scientific concepts as meaning-making resources for young EFL learners in the learning of pragmatics,"This article reports on a study investigating the role of scientific concepts in the metapragmatic awareness of Norwegian primary EFL learners following a four-week instructional intervention on requesting informed by sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 2012/1934). Through introducing pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic dimensions of requesting, the intervention aimed to develop metapragmatic awareness and foster learner agency by teaching pragmalinguistic resources related to request strategies, raising awareness of contextual considerations, and drawing attention to individual perceptions of appropriateness. The instruction focused on scientific concepts, that is, systematic and abstract objects of study which facilitate learner reflections. This article draws on data collected during group interviews to analyse whether learners used scientific concepts introduced during the instruction—for example, directness of the head act and attention getters—and if so, how these were used to express metapragmatic understandings. The analysis shows how such scientific concepts were internalised and used by learners to express their understandings of the importance of linguistic variation and the communicative functions of requests, as well as compare request strategies in English and Norwegian. Lived experiences, contextual considerations, and prior knowledge were also used as frames of reference for interpreting the appropriateness of requests. Adding to pragmatics research using concept-based approaches with (young) adults (e.g., van Compernolle, 2014), this study reveals that internalising a conceptual understanding of pragmatic phenomena in a foreign language is possible even for young language learners, thus contributing to knowledge about how learners come to understand pragmatic phenomena and how pragmatics can be taught with these age groups.",,10.29140/ice.v4n2.485,https://doi.org/10.29140/ice.v4n2.485,forward

It starts with a discussion of what pragmatics entails. Next, issues relating to the teaching of pragmatics are identified, such as the language background of the teacher, comparisons between second- (L2) and foreign-language (FL) instruction, and the potential role of digital media and other means in providing models for pragmatic behavior. Then, an international survey is presented which probed into the experiences of NNTs of various languages while teaching the pragmatics of their language of instruction. A total of 113 teachers were asked to indicate what they taught with regard to pragmatics, 30 native-language teachers (NTs) and 83 NNTs. They were also asked to report on their experience as teachers of L2 and FL pragmatics (e.g., if they encountered classroom moments when they did not feel like an authority on some aspect of pragmatics, what they did about it). Since pragmatics is a meeting of language and culture, the teacher respondents were asked to assess their knowledge regarding pragmalinguistics (i.e., the language forms) and sociopragmatics (sociocultural knowledge). In addition, they were asked to give their opinion regarding similarities and differences between the teaching of FL as opposed to L2 pragmatics, as this traditional dichotomy gives way to a more hybrid reality in an increasingly globalized world. Similarly, they were asked about their methods for teaching pragmatics (e.g., their use of digital media and their handling of dialect differences). Finally, they were asked to suggest areas in which they would like to see research conducted that would inform the teaching of pragmatics. The paper reports the findings from the study, including statistical differences in reported teaching of criticism, sarcasm, and cursing, as well as in the use of digital media and in having students gather data on pragmatics.",,10.14746/SSLLT.2016.6.4.2,https://doi.org/10.14746/SSLLT.2016.6.4.2,forward
Lama Nassif,2021.0,Codeswitching between Modern Standard and Colloquial Arabic as L2 sociolinguistic competence,"Multidialectal use of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Colloquial Arabic (CA) has become standard practice among Arabic speakers.
 Therefore, a question facing Arabic instructors and curriculum planners is what methods to adopt to raise learners’ awareness of
 this sociolinguistic reality. Some programs introduce MSA and one variety of CA from the beginning of Arabic instruction. However,
 the question of how learners who receive multidialectal training use MSA and CA simultaneously in their speech productions and how
 their MSA–CA use evolves over their years of Arabic study remains under-researched. The current study addressed these questions by
 studying the speech productions of 51 second language (L2) Arabic learners enrolled in three years of Arabic instruction. The data
 show that the participants consistently code-switched between MSA and CA, and seemed to conform to sociocultural norms designating
 MSA as more formal and CA as more personal and intimate. As learners’ proficiency levels increased, a wider range of
 sociolinguistic functions was observed. The study reinforces the importance of L2 Arabic curricula decisions that embrace the

"S. M. R. Amirian, Ali Zangoei",2016.0,The Effect of Concept Mapping on Learning English Requests by Iranian High School Students,"Abstract Research into interlanguage pragmatics has prominent significance nowadays. Due to severe negative consequences of failure in performing and interpreting speech acts such as request, the present study made an attempt to investigate the effect of concept mapping on learning English requests by Iranian high school students. To this aim, 72 male students of grade two from two high schools in Gonabad participated in the study. The participants were two intact groups ranging from 15 to 18 years old. Data for this study were collected using English Test- Beginner (proficiency test) and Written Discourse Completion Task (WDCT). The results indicated there was a statistically significant difference between the request speech act knowledge of those learners who were taught requests through concept mapping and those who were taught traditionally. Therefore, concept mapping strategy outweighed the traditional one in learning English requests. The results of the current study have important implications for syllabus designer and material writers to have a new insight to the content of syllabi and textbooks especially for EFL context.

The participants were 50 Catalan/Spanish bilingual students (aged 12–14) from three intact classes who were learners of English as a Foreign Language and with an upper-intermediate level of proficiency. The three groups followed different approaches to teaching pragmatics: G1 was instructed in pragmatics following a task-supported approach; G2 was also instructed in pragmatics but no tasks were used; and G3 was a control group with no instruction on pragmatics and no use of tasks, either. To assess pragmatic learning, role-plays were used both before and after the pedagogical intervention. The pragmatic analysis focused on the speech acts of giving opinion, agreeing/disagreeing, interrupting, and acknowledging the interlocutor. Results showed that the two instructed groups, regardless of the type, were more pragmatically competent in the posttest in one of the pragmatic moves (i.e., interrupting). Additionally, G1 presented statistically significant differences in the posttest when acknowledging the interlocutor. Regarding the control group, no differences were found in any of the moves. These findings suggest that instruction in general, and task-supported instruction in particular, has a positive impact on the development of interlanguage pragmatics in a classroom context.",,10.1075/ap.18010.bar,https://doi.org/10.1075/ap.18010.bar,forward

The CBPI intervention consisted of six group sessions with a pre-test - instruction - post-test design. While minor inter-level differences exist, all participants in the intervention exhibited enhanced sociopragmatic capacity. Participants demonstrated a shift from rule-of-thumb-based thinking to a focus on the meaning potential of utterances. By appropriating sociopragmatic concepts through CBPI, learners also gained an understanding of their own agency in the meaning design of address pronouns as well as the consequences of creating particular meanings.",,10.1558/lst.37359,https://doi.org/10.1558/lst.37359,forward

Both teachers and students agreed that CF is not only important but necessary since junior and senior students still have pronunciation problems and the best time to provide CF is soon after presentation. However, they differed in concern about students’ self-respect, the types of errors that should receive CF and preference for the types of CF. In particular, students’ eagerness to learn exceeded their concern about self-respect. Teachers turned to offer CF to repeated errors, while students would like to receive more than teachers could offer. Moreover, teachers regarded prompt as being more effective, whereas students preferred recast to prompt considering the latter to be more demanding though they held similar views about explicit correction. It is suggested that taking into consideration both teachers’ and students’ perceptions of CF would help improve senior and junior students’ pronunciation.",,10.5539/IJEL.V6N6P245,https://doi.org/10.5539/IJEL.V6N6P245,forward

An EFL community such as Thailand is no exception. A canon of research into the need for enhancing the organizational competence of a learner in the L2 has been conducted and reported over several decades. In addition, empirical studies in pragmatics involving and benefiting the learner have gained ground in several ESL and EFL countries. However, the EFL teacher, who is usually the chief facilitator in an EFL context, is marginalized both as a focus of research and in the development of their pragmatic skills in English. An unfair reason generally given is that adult learners have a sufficient stockpile of already acquired pragmatics knowledge in their L1, which would serve them as needed. Yet, as observed over the years this assumption is proving costly. The academic paper authored here, based on literature and a recent needs analysis, makes a case for the immediacy of including explicit instruction in pragmatics through professional development workshops in the Thai EFL context with the chief aim of empowering the Asian EFL teacher.",,10.5539/ACH.V8N2P57,https://doi.org/10.5539/ACH.V8N2P57,forward

Participants were 30 Taiwanese EFL eighth graders who received a 10-week pragmatic training on email apologies. Research instruments were a multiple-choice test (MCT), a written discourse completion task (WDCT), and retrospective verbal reports (RVRs). The results showed that the participants obtained higher scores in the MCTs after the instruction, illustrating the facilitative effects on the learners’ comprehension of email writing. As for the production, the learners made overall progress in email writing in the posttest. Regarding the cognitive processes, analysis of the RVRs revealed that after the treatment, the learners’ pragmalinguistic awareness was promoted in their paying more attention to pragmalinguistic features and planning their email writing according to the email moves more frequently. The findings were discussed with implications for pedagogy and future research.",,10.1515/iral-2019-0116,https://doi.org/10.1515/iral-2019-0116,forward

A Mixed-Methods Approach.,"This study examined the teaching approaches and techniques that Iranian instructors utilize for teaching L2 pragmatics in their classroom practices. 238 Iranian instructors participated in this study. The data for this study were accumulated through questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. In terms of the instructional approaches, both the quantitative and qualitative results showed that instructors make use of inductive and implicit approaches more than other two approaches, deductive and explicit, to teach L2 pragmatics .With regard to the pragmatic consciousness-raising techniques, the results revealed that instructors mostly make use of conversation topics and also situations to raise learners’ awareness of the speech act under study. In addition to this technique, instructors make use of field experience to give input to learners. Regarding the pragmatic communicative practice techniques, the quantitative and qualitative results showed that instructors mostly make use of role-play and pair- work techniques to engage learners to practice speech acts. Moreover, the results of the questionnaire and interview with regard to pragmatic corrective feedback techniques showed that instructors almost give feedback implicitly by reformulating learners’ mistakes and repeating their errors On the contrary, instructors give less metalinguistic information and explain the inappropriate expressions to learners. In terms of culture teaching techniques, the results illustrated that instructors share their knowledge of what they hear or read about other cultures with their learners. The results of this study have some implications for language instructors.",,10.5539/ELT.V9N5P166,https://doi.org/10.5539/ELT.V9N5P166,forward

Educators as well as researchers exploring a new domain of inquiry may rely on the conclusions from meta-analytic reviews rather than reading multiple primary studies. This article calls for caution in this regard because the outcome of a meta-analysis is determined by how effect sizes are calculated, how factors are defined, and how studies are selected for inclusion. Three recently published meta-analyses are reexamined to illustrate these issues. The first illustrates the risk of conflating effect sizes from studies with different design features; the second illustrates problems with delineating the variable of interest, with implications for cause-effect relations; and the third illustrates the challenge of determining the eligibility of candidate studies. Replication attempts yield outcomes that differ from the three original meta-analyses, suggesting also that conclusions drawn from meta-analyses need to be interpreted cautiously.",,10.1017/S0272263120000327,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263120000327,forward

Sydorenko,2015.0,The use of computer-delivered structured tasks in pragmatic instruction: An exploratory study,"Abstract This study examines the effect of oral practice via computer-delivered structured tasks (CASTs) with native speaker (NS) models and open-ended tasks without NS input (i.e., learner-leaner role-plays) on pragmatic development of second language learners. While prior studies have indicated that structured tasks afford more opportunities for focus on form (FonF) than open-ended tasks (Lee and VanPatten 2003; Lyster 2004; Ranta and Lyster 2007; Skehan and Foster 1999; Tavakoli and Foster 2011), differences between these tasks in pragmatic instruction (PI) have not been examined. Additionally, the effect of practice has been widely examined with regard to oral development, but much less so for pragmatics (e.g., Li 2013; Takimoto 2012a). In this study, one group of ESL learners practiced request speech acts via CASTs, and another group did so via learner-learner open role-plays. Qualitative analysis of participants’ output during practice suggests that rehearsal via CASTs promotes FonF and incorporation of NS models into learners’ speech, while rehearsal via role-plays results in more creative, but often pragmatically inappropriate, language and content. Additionally, role-plays, but not CASTs, appear to be conducive to humorous language play, metapragmatic discussions, and extended turns similar to those in naturalistic interactions. The study offers insights regarding task types in PI.",,10.1515/ip-2015-0017,https://doi.org/10.1515/ip-2015-0017,forward

The majority of these studies have included analysis of how different first language speakers make complaints while only a limited number of studies have examined the effects of instruction on the development of complaints as a speech act. Those that have examined this area have tended to focus on oral complaints made to second parties. The current study focuses on the receptive and productive benefits of instruction in developing informal second party complaints in the context of interaction amongst peers. Using an experimental design with control and experimental groups, we examined the effects of instruction on EFL learners in Saudi Arabia as related to informal second party complaints made via WhatsApp text-chat. Results show a significant effect on receptive knowledge of complaints for the experimental group but no significant differences in terms of appropriacy of complaint production.",,10.1080/09571736.2022.2088442,https://doi.org/10.1080/09571736.2022.2088442,forward
"M. Rostamy, Kaivan Parhoodeh",2015.0,The effect of instruction on learning refusals in EFL learners,"The major aim of learning a second or foreign language is communication. In order to be a competent communicator, we must get familiar with the ingredients of speech and language. Speech acts are one of the principal elements and functional units of communication. In this realm, refusals play a key role. Due to their inherently face threatening nature, refusals are of an especially sensitive nature, and a pragmatic breakdown in this act may easily lead to unintended offence or breakdowns in communication. Refusals are also of interest due to their typically complex constructions. They are often negotiated over several terms and involve some degree of indirectness. While there are a great number of studies which examine certain speech acts, the amount of research on refusals is much more limited. The aim of this study is to investigate whether either of the instruction types, explicit vs. implicit, proves more efficient in improving pragmatic performance of Iranian EFL learners. For this reason, 45 male, military intermediate EFL learners all between19-25 years of age in a military language institute, in Tehran, Iran, were selected to participate in the study. A pretest/posttest design was adopted in this study. Having formed the three groups under investigation, (explicit, implicit and explicit-implicit) I measured all subjects’ pragmatic performance of L2 refusals through Discourse Completion Tests, DCTs. All groups were exposed to conversations from 'spectrum' English books which embody refusals. The findings proved the efficiency of explicit instruction over implicit one in increasing Iranian EFL learners' pragmatic performance.",,10.17722/JELL.V3I1.43,https://doi.org/10.17722/JELL.V3I1.43,forward
