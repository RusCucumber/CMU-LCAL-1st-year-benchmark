"A. Barron, Klaus P. Schneider",2009.0,Variational pragmatics: Studying the impact of social factors on language use in interaction,"Intercultural pragmatics is usually associated with pragmatic di¤erences between di¤erent languages. This seems to be the default reading of the term. However, this reading tacitly ignores that there is no one-to-one relationship between languages and cultures.1 Speakers who share the same native language do not necessarily share the same culture. For instance, native speakers of English in Ireland and the United States use language in di¤erent ways (e.g., Schneider 1999, 2008). Neither do Americans in the US all use English in the same way (cf., e.g., Barron 2009; Wolfram and Schilling 2006: 93–101). On the other hand, cultures may be shared by speakers with di¤erent native languages. Thus, as language use in interaction is shaped by cultural values, pragmatic similarities may occur across languages, while pragmatic di¤erences may occur across varieties of the same language. Variational pragmatics is a subdiscipline of intercultural pragmatics. Other subdisciplines include contrastive pragmatics, cross-cultural pragmatics, ethnopragmatics, interlanguage pragmatics, and postcolonial pragmatics. Contrastive pragmatics is concerned with inter-lingual di¤erences, i.e., with pragmatic variation between di¤erent languages. Crosscultural pragmatics, on the other hand, compares the ways in which different languages are used in communication. It also deals with native speaker—non-native speaker interaction and with lingua franca communication (cf. Blum-Kulka et al. 1989; House-Edmondson 1986: 282).2 Ethnopragmatics is concerned with explaining speech practices in terms of a culture-internal perspective (e.g., in terms of values) rather than in terms of presumed pragmatic universals (cf. Goddard 2006). Interlanguage pragmatics focuses on the specific nature of language use conventions in learner language, e.g., in the English as a foreign language spoken by native speakers of German, and also on the acquisition of these conventions by learners (cf. Kasper 1998; Kasper and Rose 1999; Barron 2003: 26–28). The use of second (as opposed to foreign) languages in interaction is studied in postcolonial pragmatics. In other words, this",,10.1515/IPRG.2009.023,https://doi.org/10.1515/IPRG.2009.023,forward
"A. Barron, Muriel Warga",2007.0,Acquisitional pragmatics: Focus on foreign language learners,"Abstract 1. Introduction Calls for research into the acquisition of pragmatic competence in a second language have been a familiar feature of the interlanguage pragmatic landscape since the 1990s. Indeed, one of the first of these many calls was made as early as 1992 by Kasper in an article focusing on pragmatic transfer. In this article, she writes “… the majority of interlanguage pragmatics studies focus on use, without much attempt to say or even imply anything about development” (1992: 204) (cf. also Kasper & Dahl 1991). This observation was then verbalized rather forcefully in a very influential publication written by Kasper and Schmidt (1996) dedicated exclusively to the acquisition of second language (L2) pragmatic competence and designed “… to profile interlanguage pragmatics as an area of inquiry in second language acquisition research …” (1996: 149). In this seminal publication, they write: Interlanguage pragmatics, the study of the development and use of strategies for linguistic action by nonnative speakers, has a peculiar status in second language research. Unlike other areas of second language study, which are primarily concerned with acquisitional patterns of interlanguage knowledge over time, the great majority of studies in ILP has not been developmental. Rather, focus is given to the ways NNSs' pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic knowledge differs from that of native speakers (NSs) and among learners with different linguistic and cultural backgrounds. To date, ILP has thus been primarily a study of second language use rather than second language learning. (1996: 150)",,10.1515/IP.2007.008,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP.2007.008,forward

"A. Cogo, M. Dewey",2006.0,Efficiency in ELF Communication: From Pragmatic Motives to Lexico-grammatical Innovation,"The considerable demographic shift in the use of English worldwide, with the effect that L2 speakers outnumber L1 speakers, particularly as typified in English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) communication, is now widely acknowledged in Applied Linguistics. To a certain extent the resulting impact this has in relation to key issues such as the ownership of English has also been recognised. Description of the linguistic consequences of this shift however is less established, and lingua franca corpora are still in their relatively early stages of development, though growing in momentum. This paper will contribute to the emerging body of work that does report on empirical studies in the field, drawing on two corpora of naturally occurring lingua franca interactions which have been gathered for PhD projects at King's College London. To date reported ELF research projects have tended to focus separately on one or other linguistic system, on phonology (e.g. Jenkins 2000; 2005), and to a lesser extent on pragmatics (e.g. House 1999), and on lexicogrammatical features (cf Seidlhofer 2004). The focus of this paper is to report on findings in both pragmatics and lexicogrammar, and in so doing to identify the interrelationship between the two systems and highlight ways in which they are mutually constitutive. The paper aims to show how pragmatic motives can lead to changes in the lexis and grammar, and in turn how lexicogrammatical innovations impact on pragmatic norms and strategies.",,10.35360/NJES.12,https://doi.org/10.35360/NJES.12,forward

A. Cohen,2008.0,Teaching and assessing L2 pragmatics: What can we expect from learners?,"This paper starts by giving a rationale for why there is value in explicitly teaching second-language (L2) learners pragmatics in the target language. The importance of a research basis for choosing pragmatic materials to teach is underscored, and the focus is put on sources for materials on pragmatics and the means of data collection. Issues in the teaching of pragmatics are considered, including determining which material to teach, how to prepare teachers to teach it, and the role of teachers in facilitating the learning of pragmatics. Next, L2 pragmatics is viewed from the learners' perspective, in terms of the learning and performance of pragmatics, as well as approaches to assessing what it is that learners are able to do in a pragmatically appropriate way. Finally, consideration is given to the role of technology in making pragmatics accessible to learners, with reference to a website for teachers and curriculum writers and to websites designed for learners of specific languages such as Japanese and Spanish. Recent work on virtual environments for practicing Spanish pragmatics is discussed and preliminary findings from a small-scale study of this effort are reported.",,10.1017/S0261444807004880,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0261444807004880,ancestry
"A. Cohen, Elite Olshtain",1981.0,DEVELOPING A MEASURE OF SOCIOCULTURAL COMPETENCE: THE CASE OF APOLOGY1,"For a number of years, there has been interest in measuring sociocultural competence (Ervin-Tripp 1972, Hymes 1974, Canale and Swain 1980). This study focuses on one important aspect of such competence: the ability to use the appropriate sociocultural rules of speaking, by reacting in a culturally acceptable way in context and by choosing stylistically appropriate forms for that context. We chose to look at productive performance in sociocultural aspects of speaking, focusing on the speech act of “apology.” The research question that prompted this study was, “Can a rating scale be developed for assessing sociocultural competence?” The subjects were 32 native Hebrew speakers, 20 of whom served as informants for apologies in English LZ and 12 as informants in Hebrew LI, and 12 Americans who served as informants in English LI. These subjects were asked to role-play their responses in eight situations in which an apology was expected. The findings show that it is possible to identify culturally and stylistically inappropriate L2 utterances in apology situations. The authors feel, however, that the results so far provide at best a crude measure of sociocultural competence and that further work with this speech act and with others is called for.",,10.1111/J.1467-1770.1981.TB01375.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-1770.1981.TB01375.X,ancestry
"A. Cohen, Rachel L. Shively",2007.0,Acquisition of Requests and Apologies in Spanish and French: Impact of Study Abroad and Strategy-Building Intervention,"The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of a curricular intervention on study-abroad students’ use of language- and culture-learning strategies and on their acquisition of requests and apologies. The intervention consisted of a brief face-to-face orientation to learning speech acts, a self-study guidebook on language and culture strategies, which included strategies for learning speech acts, and electronic journaling by the students. The study used an experimental design in which the participants, all university students (N = 86) who spent 1 semester abroad in a Spanish- or a French-speaking country, were randomly assigned to an experimental (E) group (N= 42) or to a control (C) group (N= 44). The findings indicated that the students as a whole improved their request and apology performance over the course of 1 semester, as rated by the Spanish and French native speakers. In addition, whereas there were no statistically significant differences between the E and C groups in their rated speech act performance overall, a qualitative analysis of speech act development among learners of Spanish (N= 67) helped to identify areas in which their performance on requests and apologies either resembled that of native speakers or diverged from it. Although fewer students than native speakers used the “query preparatory with verbal downgrading,” there appeared to be some increase in the use of this strategy by study-abroad students from pre- to posttest, especially among the E group students, perhaps suggesting that for some of these students awareness about mitigating requests was enhanced by the treatment. In making apologies, not as many study-abroad students intensified their apologies in instances where native speakers tended to do so. Likewise, the percentage of study-abroad students who acknowledged responsibility for certain infractions tended to be lower than that of the native speakers, suggesting that these nonnative speakers were unaware of sociopragmatic norms for what might be expected in such situations.",,10.1111/J.1540-4781.2007.00540.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1540-4781.2007.00540.X,ancestry

A. Jalilifar,2009.0,Request Strategies: Cross-Sectional Study of Iranian EFL Learners and Australian Native Speakers.,"This study was a cross-sectional investigation into the request strategies used by Iranian learners of English as a Foreign Language and Australian native speakers of English. The sample involved 96 BA and MA Persian students and 10 native speakers of English. A Discourse Completion Test (DCT) was used to generate data related to the request strategies used by each group. Selection of request situations in DCT was based on two social factors of relative power and social distance. Although results revealed pragmatic development, particularly in the movement from direct to conventionally indirect strategies on the part of EFL learners, learners with higher proficiency displayed overuse of indirect type of requesting; whereas the native group was characterized by the more balanced use of this strategy. The lower proficiency learners, on the other hand, overused the most direct strategy type. In terms of the influence of the social variables, the findings of this research revealed that as far as social power is concerned EFL learners display closer performance to native speakers. But considering social distance, it seems that Iranian EFL learners have not acquired sufficient sociopragmatic knowledge to display proper social behavior.",,10.5539/ELT.V2N1P46,https://doi.org/10.5539/ELT.V2N1P46,forward
A. Liddicoat,2006.0,Learning the culture of interpersonal relationships: Students' understandings of personal address forms in French,"Abstract The French pronoun system presents a particular difficulty for English-speaking learners of French with the distinction between the second person pronouns tu and vous. In textbooks, these pronouns are typically described in terms of politeness or formality but the reality is much more complex. In addition, the pronouns interact with address terms such as first name, title + last name and title + first name, which give the system further complexity. While the language structures involved are simple, the cultural context in which they are deployed is complex and involves an understanding of how interpersonal relationships are constructed and communicated through the French language. This paper will explore students' learning of aspects of the French address system from an intercultural perspective and examine the ways in which learners come to construct their own personal understandings of interpersonal relationships as they are represented in and through French.",,10.1515/IP.2006.003,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP.2006.003,forward
"A. Liddicoat, C. Crozet",2001.0,Acquiring French interactional norms through instruction,"Introduction The emergence of intercultural competence in language teaching (Kramsch, 1993, 1995; Lustig & Koester, 1993; Byram & Zarate, 1994; Crozet, Liddicoat, & Lo Bianco, 1999) has led to a need to focus on a second language as a vehicle for communication in cultural contexts, and this in turn implies that an important goal for language learning is developing an understanding of appropriate communication in the target language (Zarate, 1986; Buttjes & Byram, 1990; Kramsch, 1995; Tickoo, 1995; Fantini, 1997; Liddicoat, 1997b). Consequently, language teaching now needs to be seen more in the context of intercultural communication, with the aim of preparing learners to communicate outside their own cultural boundaries (Bolten, 1993; Crozet, 1996; Liddicoat, 1997b; Liddicoat & Crozet, 1997; Liddicoat, Crozet, Jansen, & Schmidt, 1997; Crozet & Liddicoat, 1999; Crozet et al., 1999). In such a perspective, pragmatic and discoursal practices become an integral part of language learning from early on because they play a central role in intercultural communication, and mismatches between them have been identified as a key factor in communication breakdowns. Many studies have shown that culturally based differences about what is expected during communication can be a significant cause of crosscultural communication difficulties (Gumperz, Judd, & Roberts, 1979; Wierzbicka, 1985, 1991; Kotthoff & Auer, 1987; Gudykunst & Kim, 1992).

"Abe, Megumi",2001.0,L2 writers' perspectives on writing in the L2 context: Six case studies of Japanese students,"Most of the existing research on L2 writing to date makes comparisons between L1 and L2 or between NSs and NNSs. There is relatively little research to date, that views L2 learners as L2 users (writers) who have multi-competent knowledge and explores L2 writers' perspectives on good writing in the L2 context. The overall purpose of this study is twofold. The first purpose is to explore the international Japanese undergraduate and graduate students' perspectives on good writing and examine the factors that affect L2 writers' perspectives on good writing in the L2 context from three different contexts: the L1 context; the L2 context; and the future context. This study also explores whether these L2 writers' perspectives on writing change during their first academic year in the U.S. The second purpose is to examine what is useful for L2 writers from their own perspective and meet the needs of L2 writers with regard to their own goals and experiences as L2 writers. This research was a longitudinal case study of six Japanese students during their first academic year in the U.S. Data consist of interviews, observations, examination of participants' writing, and discussions about model writing the participants considered “good writing.” The data revealed individual differences among the L2 writers regarding how much they struggled with adjusting to L2 and how much their L1 perspectives transferred to their L2 writing and changed. Furthermore, L2 writers' confidence in L1 writing transferred directly to their confidence in L2 writing at the beginning: the participants with more writing experiences in L1 perceived themselves as better writers and had more confidence in L1 writing than those with less L1 writing experience. However, their confidence level seemed to have changed later in the year. The findings suggest educators need to increase their awareness that L2 writers bring their perspectives on writing from the L1 context and that these perspectives are tentative because L2 writers acquire mixed perspectives from the L1, L2, and future contexts, thus becoming multi-competent.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-writers-perspectives-on-writing-context-six/docview/304717875/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

It was found that native speakers tend to combine clauses but non-native speakers tend not to. Of the three ways to combine clauses, the native speakers used conjunctive suffixes the most, followed by conjunctive particles. Conjunctions were used least. The non-native speakers showed a preference for conjunctions. Most of the forms used by the non-native speakers were used by the native speakers and covered in the textbooks. The forms frequently used by the non-native speakers were used by the native speakers frequently, and were taught early. However, some of the forms which the native speakers used were not presented in the textbooks at all. Introducing clause-combining forms from the beginning and teaching important forms in the textbooks is suggested.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/combining-clauses-native-non-speakers-japanese/docview/305050936/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Acartürk, Cengiz",2005.0,Gradient Characteristics of the Unaccusative/Unergative Distinction in Turkish : An Experimental Investigation,"This thesis investigates the gradient behaviour of monadic intransitive verb classes in Turkish, under an aspectual classification of the unaccusative/unergative verb types, namely The Split Intransitivity Hierarchy. This Hierarchy claims that intransitive verb types are subject to gradient acceptability in certain syntactic constructions. The methods used in judgment elicitation studies in psychophysics, such as the magnitude estimation technique have recently been adapted to be used in capturing gradient linguistic data. Also, the practical benefits of the Internet directed researchers to design and conduct web-based experiments for linguistic data elicitation. Research on Human Computer Interaction offers suggestions for the design of more usable user interfaces. Considering these developments, in this thesis, a web based experiment interface has been designed as an extension to the magnitude estimation technique to elicit acceptability judgments on two syntactic constructions, i.e. the - mIş participle (the unaccusative diagnostic) and impersonal passivization (the unergative diagnostic) for different verb types on the Split Intransitivity Hierarchy. The experiment was conducted on the Internet. The results show that in the two diagnostics, the verb types receive categorical or indeterminate acceptability judgments, which allows us to specify the core or peripheral status of the verbs. Within the classes we have examined, change of state verbs constitute the core unaccusative verbs, and controlled (motional and non-motional) process verbs constitute the core unergative verbs. Stative verbs and uncontrolled process verbs are peripheral unaccusatives and unergatives, respectively. Change of location verbs (with an animate subject) are close to the unergative end.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/gradient-characteristics-unaccusative-unergative/docview/3122725342/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Akai, Sawako",2007.0,Enhancing teaching and learning speech acts: Action research of Japanese as a foreign language,"This action research observes a second year Japanese class at a university where foreign language courses are elective for undergraduate students. In this study, using the six strategies to teach Japanese speech acts that Ishihara and Cohen (2006) suggested, I conducted three classes and analyzed my teaching practice with a critical friend. These strategies assist learners toward the development of their understanding of the following Japanese speech acts and also keep the learners to use them in a manner appropriate to the context: (1)&#xa0;invitation and refusal; (2)&#xa0;compliments; and (3)&#xa0;asking for a permission. The aim of this research is not only to improve my instruction in relation to second language (L2) pragmatic development, but also to raise further questions and to develop future research. The findings are analyzed and the data derived from my journals, artifacts, students' work, observation sheets, interviews with my critical friend, and pretests and posttests are coded and presented. The analysis shows that (1)&#xa0;after my critical friend encouraged my study and my students gave me some positive comments after each lesson, I gained confidence in teaching the suggested speech acts; (2)&#xa0;teaching involved explaining concepts and strategies, creating the visual material (a video) showing the strategies, and explaining the relationship between the strategy and grammatical forms and samples of misusing the forms; (3)&#xa0;students' background and learning styles influenced lessons; and (4)&#xa0;pretest and posttests showed that the students' level of their L2 appropriate pragmatics dramatically improved after each instruction. However, after careful observation, it was noted that some factors prevented students from producing the correct output even though they understood the speech act differences.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/enhancing-teaching-learning-speech-acts-action/docview/304705803/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
Akemi Fu,2002.0,The Effect of Explicit Instruction on Modality Use in L2 Academic Writing,"The purpose of the present study is to examine the effect of instruction on pragmatic development in second language (L2) writing. Wishnoff (1999) investigated the effect of instruction on L2 pragmatic acquisition in writing with a particular focus on the functions of hedges, such as modal verbs, modal adverbs, and lexical verbs . The result shows that there are two main effects and an interactional effect. This research particularly focuses on the development of modal words which function as aggravating and mitigating the argument in academic writing. The participants for this research were undergraduate students who were taking an ESL writing course as a requirement. In the immediate-post test, students in the experimental group, who received explicit instruction on modality, use significantly outperformed the students in the control group, who received zero treatment. However, the durability of the instructional effect and the effect of different types of instruction (explicit/implicit/zero treatment) still remain to be explored in further studies.",,10.11431/SECONDLANGUAGE2002.1.0_20,https://doi.org/10.11431/SECONDLANGUAGE2002.1.0_20,forward

HB £42.95/US $69.95/Can $99.95.","The question of “how second languages are learned” (Gass & Selinker 1994:1) is central to second language acquisition (SLA) research; however, although a number of longitudinal studies have been carried out examining second language (L2) grammatical development, very little attention has been devoted to L2 learners' development of pragmatic competence over time. As Achiba points out, the majority of previous studies on L2 (or interlanguage) pragmatics have observed the single-moment pragmatic realization of a group of L2 learners with similar proficiency levels and compared it with that of native speakers or L2 learners with different proficiency levels or first language (L1) backgrounds. The current paucity of knowledge regarding the developmental aspect of L2 pragmatic competence has led to calls for detailed longitudinal interlanguage pragmatic studies (cf. Kasper & Schmidt 1996, Kasper & Rose 1999). Achiba's study, which carefully observes the pragmatic development in English requestive realization of a seven-year-old Japanese girl over a period of 17 months, certainly meets these essential needs.",,10.1017/S0047404504245055,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047404504245055,forward

"Alhawary, Mohammad T",2009.0,Speech Processing Prerequisites or L1 Transfer? Evidence From English and French L2 Learners of Arabic,"The article aims at investigating speech processing prerequisite claims made by Pienemann's Processability Theory (1998). Longitudinal data from eight English L1 and one French L1 speaker learning Arabic as an L2 were used to investigate the emergence/processing of demonstrative-predicate gender agreement and verbal agreement structures hypothesized to be processable at the same stage: Stage 4. The findings show that both forms were not processable by the English L1 participants at the same stage, as the participants seemed to encounter more problems with demonstrative-predicate agreement than with verbal agreement. The findings are further supported by cross-sectional data of 53 English and French L2 learners of Arabic, where between-group effects were found with respect to demonstrative-predicate agreement. It is concluded that this is likely due to L1 transfer-a factor not accounted for by Processability Theory.

Alicia Martínez-Flor,2006.0,Task Effects on EFL Learners' Production of Suggestions: A Focus on Elicited Phone Messages and Emails,"Scholars in the field of interlanguage pragmatics have examined second language learners’ development of pragmatics by means of employing different data collection instruments. Findings from this research have showed the existence of task effects, although the need to further investigate this area has been claimed by widening the types of instruments being employed as well as the context in which they are used. Accordingly, the present study aims at examining the task effects of two production instruments (phone messages and email tasks) on the learners’ use of suggestions in a foreign language setting. The participants included 81 Spanish university learners who were required to make suggestions in the oral and written production tasks. These tasks were elaborated on purpose for this study, and all situations i) varied according to the sociopragmatic factor of status; ii) were set atthe University setting, as a familiar context to the participants; and iii) asked learners to perform suggestions in the role of students. Learners’ performance when making suggestions in the phone messages and email tasks was compared. The results revealed statistically significant differences, which support the fact that the production task in which learners are engaged in influences their use of suggestions. Moreover, the findings also showed that participants employed a higher number of appropriate suggestions in the written task than in the oral task. These findings are discussed and pedagogical implications highlighted.",,10.26754/ojs_misc/mj.200610088,https://doi.org/10.26754/ojs_misc/mj.200610088,forward

Alison Mackey,2006.0,"Feedback, noticing and instructed second language learning","Second language acquisition researchers have claimed that feedback provided during conversational interaction facilitates second language (L2) acquisition. A number of experimental studies have supported this claim, connecting interactional feedback with L2 development. Researchers have suggested that interactional feedback is associated with L2 learning because it prompts learners to notice L2 forms. This study explores the relationships between feedback, instructed ESL learners’ noticing of L2 form during classroom interactions and their subsequent L2 development. Interactional feedback was provided to learners in response to their production problems with questions, plurals, and past tense forms. Learners’ noticing was assessed through on-line learning journals, introspective comments while viewing classroom videotapes, and questionnaire responses. Through a controlled pre-test, post-test design, analyses of noticing and learning were carried out for each learner. The results point to an interesting, complex and positive relationship between interactional feedback in the classroom, the learners’ reports about noticing and their learning of L2 question forms.",,10.1093/APPLIN/AMI051,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/AMI051,ancestry

(b)&#xa0;What are the writing strategies they apply when writing in L2? (c)&#xa0;What are the similarities or differences between the writing processes they apply when writing in L1 and in L2?

The population of this study includes 161 male and 42 female Saudi undergraduate ESL students attending American universities. The data used in this study was obtained using two methodologies: quantitative and qualitative. First, the quantitative data were collected via an online survey. Second, and based on the participants' scores on Rose's Writer's Block test, stimulated recall interviews (SRls) were conducted with six participants, three of whom were characterized as blocked in L1 but not in L2, and three of whom were characterized as blocked in L2 but not in L1. The SRIs required each participant to write about a descriptive topic in L1 and another in L2, independently. The results of this study indicated several things: there were differences between L1 and L2 in the training received and in the pre-writing and post-writing processes applied; there were similarities in the while-writing processes in both languages; there were relationships between the L1 and L2 writing processes; there were no significant differences between the writing processes of males and females in L1 and L2.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/arabic-first-language-writing-english-second/docview/305317459/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ananth, Priya",2007.0,Acquisition of Tense and Aspect in <em>Toki </em>'When' Clauses in Japanese as a Second /Foreign Language,"This study examined the acquisition of tense-aspect in toki ‘when’ clauses in Japanese among adult learners of Japanese as a second or foreign language. The objective of the study was to investigate if native languages (Language Transfer Hypothesis) and/or inherent semantic characteristics of verbs (Aspect Hypothesis) play a role in the selection of the -ru/-ta endings in toki ‘when’ clauses. The experimental study was conducted with 37 participants in Experiment 1 (with Achievement verbs in the toki clause position) and 34 participants in Experiment 2 (with Accomplishment, Activity and Stative verbs in the toki clause position). The research instrument consisted of a written version of the Truth Value Judgment Task in which the participants were asked to judge whether a sentence written in Japanese matched the content of a story that preceded it. The experimental results suggest that the Language Transfer Hypothesis seems to be working independently for the Durative verbs (Experiment 2) category, while the Aspect Hypothesis seems to be independently working for the Achievement verbs (Experiment 1) category. That is, both these hypotheses seem to be working partially for the two categories of verbs (Achievements and Duratives). There were two sets of results obtained that were not predicted by the two hypotheses. The Language Transfer Hypothesis does not predict the good performances of the Chinese and English speakers for the S1 ru toki S2 ta pattern in the Durative category, while the Aspect Hypothesis does not predict the absence of over-use of - ta with Accomplishment verbs in the present study. The first unpredicted result can possibly be explained by offering another hypothesis, that learners are also sensitive to the durative semantic aspect (or lack thereof) of the verbs in question. That is, their choice of the -ru/-ta morpheme in toki clauses is also influenced by the issue of whether the verb in question represents an event that has a certain length of duration or if it occurs momentarily. For verbs that express a duration-like Accomplishment, Stativity or Activity, the learners associate the -ru with the duration of the verb and are able to select the morpheme correctly. As for the second result that deviated from the predictions, that Accomplishment verbs are not showing errors with over-use of -ta , it can be conjectured that learners are not focusing on the end-point of the Accomplishment verbs, and are treating them as Activity verbs with a finite duration. Thus, from this study it seems that besides telicity, another semantic feature, namely, the durative versus instantaneous character of the verb is also playing an important role in the choice of the -ru/-ta morphemes in toki clauses. These results have important pedagogical implications in that it may be useful to introduce the inherent semantic characteristics of the verbs such as durativity, telicity and punctuality in the Japanese language classroom and teaching materials. Since the learners seem to be naturally sensitive to these characteristics, introducing them in the classroom will assist them in their internal processing as well as production of the time expressions in Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-tense-aspect-em-toki-when-clauses/docview/304832688/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
Andrea Golato,2003.0,Studying Compliment Responses: A Comparison of DCTs and Recordings of Naturally Occurring Talk,"This article provides a detailed study of the differences between compliment responses collected with two different data collection procedures: naturally occurring data analysed through conversation analytic (CA) methodology, and elicited data collected via a discourse completion task (DCT). The DCT was designed to evoke the same discourse context and preceding cotext observed in the naturally occurring data. The article demonstrates that these data collection procedures do not always yield data that speak equally well to given research questions. It is argued that recording naturally occurring talk-in-interaction enables the researcher to study how language is organized and realized in natural settings, whereas responses from data elicitation procedures such as DCTs indirectly reflect the sum of prior experience with language. Additionally, the article discusses advantages and disadvantages of data collection procedures including questionnaires, recall protocols, role play, field observation, and recordings of naturally occurring talk-in-interaction. The article concludes by discussing the feasibility of generalizing findings generated from the aforementioned data-collection instruments.",,10.1093/APPLIN/24.1.90,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/24.1.90,ancestry
Andrew Sangpil Byon,2006.0,Developing KFL Students’ Pragmatic Awareness of Korean Speech Acts: The Use of Discourse Completion Tasks,"Teaching pragmatic competence in Korean-as-a-foreign language (KFL) settings is still an underdeveloped area, when compared to teaching other language areas, such as speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The first step to enhance pragmatic language teaching in foreign language (FL) education is to raise the FL instructors’ and students’ pragmatic awareness (Kasper & Rose, 2001). This paper investigates a case of raising pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic awareness of Korean speech acts to intermediate KFL students in an American university, using a discourse completion task (DCT). This study discusses how the DCT approach, as a pragmatic-consciousness-raising (PCR) technique, can assist FL instructors in developing pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic awareness of the target speech acts. The study shows that DCT provided a very practical tool for our students to recognise the pragmatic features. Conducting a survey with L1 and L2 speakers made the learning process more engaging, relevant, and interesting for most students. Although the discussion and procedures presented in this paper are from an American college-level intermediate KFL course, the cases presented may be adapted for use in any foreign language course that has struggled with teaching L2 pragmatic competence.",,10.2167/la410.0,https://doi.org/10.2167/la410.0,ancestry

The subjects of the study ( N = 519) were the preparatory class students of various departments of Erciyes University in Kayseri who received a one-year English instruction at Erciyes University School of Foreign Languages (EUSFL) during the academic year 2001- 2002. In line with the “Input-Context-Outcome” research framework of the study, the data were gathered from the students through self-report questionnaires and school records prior to (Input-entering student characteristics variables), during (Context- classroom environment variables), and at the end (Outcome) of the specified instructional period (one-semester), which were subjected to various applications of Multivariate Linear Regression procedures. The findings indicated different patterns of relationships depending on the type of outcome assessed with significant predictors from both input and context classes. In descending order of effect size, the significant predictors of class participation were teacher supportiveness, involvement, satisfaction with course materials, speaking anxiety, self-concept, task orientation and organization, effort, student cohesiveness, physical conditions, overall academic achievement, and previous exposure, which altogether accounted for 74 % of the variance in students’ levels of class participation. The amount of variance accounted for study habits was 40 %, with involvement, overall academic achievement, self-concept, student residence, and gender emerging as significant predictors. As for the English achievement criterion, overall academic achievement, teacher supportiveness, selfconcept, involvement, satisfaction with course materials, previous exposure, and student residence were significant predictors which accounted for 56 % of the overall variance. The findings are discussed in light of relevant theory and empirical research and suggestions are made for pedagogical practices and further research directions.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-students-entering-characteristics/docview/3132854529/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

B. Vanpatten,1996.0,Input Processing and Grammar Instruction in Second Language Acquisition,"This book provides an alternative to the ""grammar debate"" in second language acquisition theory and teaching. Accepting that language acquisition is at least partially input dependent, the author asks how grammatical form is processed in the input by second language learners and is it possible to assist this in ways that help the learner to create richer grammatical intake. He answers these questions and explains why traditional paradigms are not psycholinguistically motivated. Drawing on research from both first and second language acquisition, he outlines a model for input processing in second language acquisition that helps to account for how learners construct grammatical systems. He then uses this model to motivate ""processing instruction,"" a type of grammar instruction in which learners are engaged in making form-meaning connections during particular input activities.",,10.2307/345093,https://doi.org/10.2307/345093,ancestry

This study explored the acquisition of universal quantifier sentences as reflected in the performance of three diverse college-level student groups on a multipicture sentence interpretation task. The participant groups (hearing native speakers, deaf students, and second language learners of English) all exhibited fundamental knowledge of universal lexical, semantic, and syntactic properties that contribute to quantifier sentence interpretation. The native speakers outperformed the deaf and second language groups, whose performance was strikingly parallel. Performance patterns are explained in terms of the influences of derivational economy, including the option to restrict in situ indefinite noun phrases to singleton indefinites. The symmetry effect observed in child language studies was also observed among the college-aged participants in this study. It is explained in terms of a pragmatic challenge in managing contextual information that invokes an unexpected singleton indefinite interpretation. The results contribute to the understanding of sentence comprehension under conditions of restricted learner access to target language input and underscore the value of seeking correlates of theory-internal derivational economy in language acquisition and use.

"Baba, Junko",1996.0,A study of interlanguage pragmatics: Compliment responses by learners of Japanese and English as a second language,"The purpose of this study is to identify the sociolinguistic variables that may affect the types of Compliment Responses (CRs) given by learners of Japanese and English as a second language. To investigate interlanguage CRs, this study compares learner data with baseline data taken from native Japanese and American English speakers. The sociolinguistic variables examined were the targets (Family versus Self) and topics (External versus Internal) of compliments. The variables were combined into four target-topic categories: Family External, Family Internal, Self External, and Self Internal. A total of 60 informants participated in the study, of which 12 were American native speakers of English (AAs), 17 were native speakers of Japanese (JJ), 14 were Japanese learners of English (ESL); and 17 were American learners of Japanese (JSLs). Each informant had a 30 to 60 minute conversation session with a female friend, or conversation leader, who was a native speaker of the language in which the conversation was conducted. The data were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. All data were tape-recorded, narrowly transcribed, and coded accordingly to Brown and Levinson's (1987) politeness types: Positive Politeness, Negative Politeness, Off-Record, and Do-not-Do-FTA (Face Threatening Act). For overall politeness types, CRs of the learners were found to approximate those of the native speakers of the target languages. A detailed examination of the sociolinguistic variables of CRs and the ""dispreferredness"" structure in discourse, however, revealed problems among learners. It was noted in the baseline data that the most significant difference was between the JJs and the AAs in Negative Politeness for the Family External CRs. Both JSLs and ESLs used pragmatic transfer from their respective L1s in the Family variable. In the Self variable, the JSLs overgeneralized the Japanese formal CRs of Refusal. The study also investigated the correlation between politeness types of CRs and the intensity of the compliments, as well as aspects of complimenting sequences. Only among AAs did Positive Politeness CRs correlate with the increased intensity of the compliments, while ESLs seemed embarrassed by exaggerated compliments. The Japanese tend to prefer longer sequences than Americans.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/study-interlanguage-pragmatics-compliment/docview/304274152/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Baker, Susan C.",2005.0,A social psychological approach to preserving heritage languages: The survival of Gaelic in Nova Scotia,"Language has been seen as a central pillar to ethnic identity. When languages are at risk, therefore, the relationship between language and ethnic identity can become particularly salient (Edwards, 1991). Heritage languages, in particular, often face what has been called a language shift, where the heritage language is replaced by the dominant language. When the heritage language is threatened, what happens to the heritage identity? In an attempt to answer this question, this study investigated the relationship between language and ethnic identity among 75 Gaelic learners living in eastern Nova Scotia. In order to identify the specific processes of heritage language use, the Gaelic learners were compared to non-learners of Gaelic and French learners living in the same milieu. Path analyses indicated that, among Gaelic learners, there is an initial separation of language and ethnic identity, but that, over time, ethnic identity is a direct outcome of language use. This finding was unique to the heritage language learners. Further, desired language vitality was a direct precursor to contact, language confidence, Gaelic and Anglophone identity and willingness to communicate among Gaelic learners. Actual language vitality played no role in the language use process among Gaelic learners, suggesting that vitality perceptions that are egocentric are better predictors of language use than those that are exocentric. The implications of these findings are discussed not only in relation to the future of Gaelic in Nova Scotia, but also to the survival of heritage languages in general.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/social-psychological-approach-preserving-heritage/docview/305368166/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Both researchers and practitioners have noted consistently that several aspects of the teaching and tutored learning of L2 pragmatics have been reported as problematic and/or underexplored in the published knowledge base to date, including the availability and authenticity of instructional materials, the provision of opportunities for the performance and practice of L2 pragmatic competence in meaningful interactions, the relative lack of developmental data documenting the precise (and varied) pathways of L2 pragmatic competence over time, and the efficacy of particular pedagogical interventions in classroom-based L2 pragmatics instruction. The role of computer mediation in each of these underexplored areas is examined with a special emphasis on the teaching and learning of L2 pragmatics in Internet-mediated partnerships and on the use of (learner) corpora in L2 pragmatics instruction and research.

"Bennett, Susan",1994.0,Second language acquisition of reflexive binding by native speakers of Serbo-Croatian,"This thesis examines the role of transfer of first (L1) language properties and access to knowledge of Universal Grammar in second language (L2) acquisition. Two empirical components are included: a study of the syntax of anaphora in Serbo-Croatian and an experimental study of second language acquisition of reflexive binding. Data from field work on the coreference properties of anaphors in Serbo-Croatian are discussed in terms of standard, parameterized, LF movement, and Relativized SUBJECT approaches to Binding Theory. Recent versions of the theory identify a categorial distinction between morphologically simple ($\rm X\sp\circ$) and complex (XP) anaphor types as a crucial factor in determining coreference relations between reflexive pronouns and their syntactic antecedents. The predictions of a morphological approach to the Binding Theory were tested in a study of the acquisition of the binding properties of English XP reflexives by native speakers of Serbo-Croatian, a language with $\rm X\sp\circ$ reflexives. Acquisition of the English binding pattern by this group of L2 learners requires recognition of the morphological complexity of English reflexives. Prior to reanalysis, learners are predicted to produce an incorrect L1 coreference pattern in the L2 environment. Two sentence comprehension tasks were administered to adolescent and adult Serbo-Croatian speaking L2 learners of English and similar groups of English native speaker controls. Picture identification and multiple choice comprehension tasks produced convergent results with significant differences between control (n = 47) and L2 learner (n = 73) interpretations of reflexives in complex noun phrases and object control infinitival sentences. Their pattern of interpretation shows evidence of transfer of the $\rm X\sp\circ$ anaphor type found in Serbo-Croatian to the target grammar and suggests L2 learners are able to apply a deductive system constrained by Universal Grammar to compute binding domains in second language acquisition.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-reflexive-binding/docview/250766919/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Biggers, Robert Glen",2002.0,Second language grammatical competency through the L(1) cultural prescription: A descriptive approach to the DCB model,"The study examines the phenomenology of native culture in second language acquisition through a study specific model. The DCB model theorizes that a beginning, nonnative language learner will be more motivated and more apt to learn a second language when matched with a culturally synonymous, more linguistically proficient, second language peer. The study examined L2 instruction in two different groupings—dyadic, instructor and student cultural congruent and whole group, instructor and student non-culturally congruent. Intent was to determine the feasibility of native cultural matching in facilitating grammatical understanding by examining the affective and pragmatic components. The study contrived artificially congruent and non-congruent cultural settings for observation. Data was collected via triangularity using discourse analysis, written assessment, and Thurstone-type survey instrumentation. Each of the two instructional motifs was presented once for each of the three lessons for a total of six treatments. Subjects were all Hispanic attendees at a Baptist mission in Batesville, Mississippi. The study considered that pragmatic judgment of the conceptual-cultural connection comes through the dynamics of speech and written discourse depicted through univariate statistics. The findings and implications generated by the study's five questions would assume to support a qualitative basis for the DCB model.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-grammatical-competency-through-l/docview/305517114/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Bohn, Mariko Tajima",2008.0,Educated Japanese young women's diverse linguistic and social behaviors during the Meiji and Taisho periods (1868–1926) with implications for Japanese language pedagogy,"This dissertation takes an historical perspective on so-called ""Japanese women's language"" ( joseigo/onna kotoba ) which has been widely categorized as the stereotypical female speech style in Japanese language, as antipodal to ""men's language"" ( danseigo/otoko kotoba ). In addition to this historical work, I consider current perspectives of gendered speech styles including ""Japanese women's language,"" investigating how Japanese language learners and instructors perceive these styles and how their perceptions impact upon language pedagogy. Recent micro-sociolinguistic studies, in contrast to the categorization of gendered speech styles, highlight the within-gender diversity in Japanese women's use of language, focusing particularly on the linguistic innovation associated with non-normative femininity. Moreover, recent studies with macrosociological analysis have focused on power and dominant ideology, identifying a ""Japanese women's language"" as a media product informed by the creation of a modern women's image during the Meiji government's modernization and language standardization in the early 20 th century. During the Meiji and Taisho period (1868-1926), however, what is today considered normative ""Japanese women's language"" was regarded as unconventional or innovative and was criticized as being coarse and unladylike by educators and linguistic norm-holders. Taking micro-and macro-social analyses into consideration, this dissertation reveals a discord between the Meiji educators' perceptions of young women's use of innovative language and the media representations of this language. This dissertation focuses on educated young women's real linguistic practices, and therefore takes a different approach from recent studies that have used macrosociological analysis. Specifically, this dissertation investigates educated young women's linguistic innovation and performance of non-normative femininity during the Meiji and Taisho periods (1868-1926), by analyzing their letter-writing in readers' correspondence columns of three women's magazines: Jogaku sekai 'The World of Women's Learning,' Fujin sekai 'The Women's World,' and Reijokai 'Ladies' World.' Through a linkage between micro- and macro-social analyses, this dissertation reveals that innovative language plays a significant role in educated young women's self-expressions and their construction of a subculture through friendship practices, and identifies the similarities in linguistic innovation and performance of non-normative femininity between contemporary young women and educated young women of the Meiji and Taisho periods. In addition, by comparing how innovative language is presented in novels and fiction, I propose dual functions of innovative language; as an expression of a writer's identity as a young and modern female writer, and as a yakuwari-go 'language that fits to a particular character' (Kinsui 2003), including the use of the sentence-final expressions, da wa and no yo , which have been categorized as stereotypical feminine forms in current literature. Furthermore, I present a possible process of the spread, maintenance, and transformation of the sentence-final expressions, da wa and no yo from being viewed as coarse to become the stereotypical women's language, by proposing four social factors: young women's school and dormitory life, mimicry performance, the influence of female students and their culture, and the popularity of female students' use of these forms in public. This dissertation consists of five chapters. The first chapter provides an outline and introduction of the dissertation. The second chapter looks at previous studies of Japanese language and gender, focusing on how women's use of language has been viewed in both Japanese and Western society. The third chapter is divided into two sections. The first section investigates the historical process of the formation and maintenance of linguistic and social norms by analyzing conduct books, textbooks used in co-educational elementary schools, and readers used in girls' high schools from the late eighteenth to the early part of the twentieth century. The second section examines educated young women's diverse use of language in letter-writing and social behaviors presented in three women's magazines. The fourth chapter investigates, through the use of a questionnaire, how gendered speech patterns, including stereotypical women's language, are perceived by current Japanese language learners and instructors. Based on the analysis of the findings of the questionnaire, this chapter has implications for Japanese language pedagogy. The final chapter presents a summary of this dissertation.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/educated-japanese-young-womens-diverse-linguistic/docview/304466488/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Brown, Amanda",2007.0,Crosslinguistic influence in first and second languages convergence in speech and gesture,"Research on second language acquisition typically focuses on how a first language (L1) influences a second language (L2) in different linguistic domains and across modalities. This dissertation, in contrast, explores interactions between languages in the mind of a language learner by asking (1)&#xa0;can an emerging L2 influence an established L1? (2)&#xa0;if so, how is such influence realized? (3)&#xa0;are there parallel influences of the Ll on the L2? These questions were investigated for the expression of Manner (e.g. climb, roll) and Path (e.g. up, down) of motion, areas where substantial crosslinguistic differences exist in speech and co-speech gesture. Japanese and English are typologically distinct in this domain; therefore, narrative descriptions of four motion events were elicited from monolingual Japanese speakers (n=16), monolingual English speakers (n=13), and native Japanese speakers with intermediate knowledge of English (narratives elicited in both their L1 and L2, n=28). Ways in which Path and Manner were expressed at the lexical, syntactic, and gestural levels were analyzed in monolingual and non-monolingual production. Results suggest mutual crosslinguistic influences. In their L1, native Japanese speakers with knowledge of English displayed both Japanese- and English-like use of morphosyntactic elements to express Path and Manner (i.e. a combination of verbs and other constructions). Consequently, non-monolingual L1 discourse contained significantly more Path expressions per clause, with significantly greater mention of Goal of motion than monolingual Japanese and English discourse. Furthermore, the gestures of non-monolingual speakers diverged from their monolingual counterparts with differences in depiction of Manner and gesture perspective (character versus observer). Importantly, non-monolingual production in the L1 was not ungrammatical, but simply reflected altered preferences. As for L2 production, many effects of L1 influence were seen, crucially in areas parallel to those described above. Overall, production by native Japanese speakers who knew English differed from that of monolingual Japanese and English speakers. But L1 and L2 production within non-monolingual individuals was similar. These findings imply a convergence of L1-L2 linguistic systems within the mind of a language learner. Theoretical and methodological implications for SLA research and language assessment with respect to the 'native speaker standard language' are discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/crosslinguistic-influence-first-second-languages/docview/304897333/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Brown, Amanda;Gullberg, Marianne",2008.0,BIDIRECTIONAL CROSSLINGUISTIC INFLUENCE IN L1-L2 ENCODING OF MANNER IN SPEECH AND GESTURE: A Study of Japanese Speakers of English,"Whereas most research in SLA assumes the relationship between the first language (L1) and the second language (L2) to be unidirectional, this study investigates the possibility of a bidirectional relationship. We examine the domain of manner of motion, in which monolingual Japanese and English speakers differ both in speech and gesture. Parallel influences of the L1 on the L2 and the L2 on the L1 were found in production from native Japanese speakers with intermediate knowledge of English. These effects, which were strongest in gesture patterns, demonstrate that (a) bidirectional interaction between languages in the multilingual mind can occur even with intermediate proficiency in the L2 and (b) gesture analyses can offer insights on interactions between languages beyond those observed through analyses of speech alone.

"C. Roberts, M. Byram, A. Barro, S. Jordan, B. Street",2000.0,Language Learners as Ethnographers,"This book describes a new approach to teaching and learning cultural studies. Borrowing the idea of ethnography from anthropologists, it argues that language students can be taught methods for investigating the cultural and social patterns of interaction and the values and beliefs that account for them. Doing an ethnographic study while living abroad immerses students in the life of particular groups, proving an intellectual challenge and the opportunity for intense intercultural encounters. The first half of the book discusses some of the current concepts in cultural and intercultural learning. The second half is a description of how the ethnography program can be run in higher education institutions, using extensive examples from ethnography courses and student projects. Overall, this book argues that the idea of language learners as ethnographers can be transferred to many contexts and that language learning should be interdisciplinary. This book is relevant to teachers of modern and foreign languages, European Studies, Latin American Studies and to teachers of upper secondary school students and trainers in intercultural communication.",,10.21832/9781853596810,https://doi.org/10.21832/9781853596810,ancestry

Yet the extent to which English language teacher preparation programs incorporate explicit instruction about pragmatics into their curricula remains unknown. A nationwide survey of master's-level TESOL programs was conducted to determine where and how pragmatics is covered in the TESOL curriculum, what resources are used to teach graduate TESOL students about pragmatics, as well as to determine some of the prevalent attitudes, beliefs, and opinions about pragmatics held by TESOL graduate program directors and faculty. Individuals from 94 master's-level TESOL programs in the United States participated in the study. Participating programs represent a variety of geographic regions, institution types, and departments. The findings of the study indicate that pragmatics is covered in a wide range of courses across programs (Sociolinguistics, Discourse Analysis, Introduction to Linguistics, Teaching Methods, SLA, etc.), and that the time spent covering pragmatics varies from no time at all, to more than 8 weeks, depending on the program.

This study describes the development and validation of a 36-item web-based test of ESL pragmalinguistics, measuring learners’ offline knowledge of implicatures and routines with multiple-choice questions, and their knowledge of speech acts with discourse completion tests. The test was delivered online to 267 ESL and EFL learners, ranging in proficiency from beginner to advanced. Evidence for construct validity was collected through correlational analyses and comparisons between groups. The effect of browser familiarity was found to be negligible, and learners generally performed as previous research would suggest: their knowledge of speech acts increased with proficiency, as did their knowledge of implicature. Their knowledge of routines, however, was strongly dependent on L2 exposure. Correlations between the sections and factor analysis confirmed that the routines, implicatures, and speech act sections are related but that each has some unique variance. The test was sufficiently reliable and practical, taking an hour to administer and little time to score.

"Chan, Paul Huen",1988.0,"From colony to neighbor: Relations between Japan and South Korea, 1945-1985","This study is divided into two parts: a historical and an analytical section. In the historical section, the postwar relations between Japan and South Korea is divided into three periods: a Confrontation Period (1948-1960), a Cooperative Period (1961-1979) and finally a Competitive Period (1980-1985). The division into three periods coincided with the political tenure of three South Korean presidents: Syngman Rhee, Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo Hwan. Rhee was an independence fighter and he hates Japan. Park was a Japanese collaborator and he admires Japan. Lastly, Chun was raised in an anti-Japanese environment and he emphasizes national pride. In turn, Rhee's hatred of Japan led to confrontational diplomacy, Park's admiration of Japan led to cooperative diplomacy and Chun's national pride led to competitive diplomacy. In the analytical section, one positive and three negative factors are identified. The role of the United States as a referee is the only positive factor. Through behind-the-scene intervention, the United States helps to promote friendship and stability in Japan-South Korean relations. The three negative factors are: the remembrance of the colonial period, the presence of Korean minority in Japan and finally Japan's two-Korea policy. The first two factors are fading in importance. As South Korea grows richer and stronger, Koreans will find less psychological need to dwell on Japanese atrocities during the colonial period (1910-1945). In turn, the Japanese will respect the Koreans more. As second and third generation Koreans in Japan are being integrated into Japanese society, they have gradually turned their energy from traditional South-North competition to struggle for their own civil and political rights in Japan. The last negative factor, namely, Japan's two Korea policy, will continue to irritate South Korea. In the 1950s, Japan and South Korea exchanged mutual contempt and practised confrontational diplomacy. In 1965, normalization of relations was achieved after 14 years of tortuous negotiations. By 1985, a strong working relations and a feeling of mutual respect have been firmly established. This successful transformation is summarized in the title ""From Colony to Neighbors"".", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/colony-neighbor-relations-between-japan-south/docview/303576537/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Chikamatsu, Nobuko",1995.0,The effects of L1 orthography on L2 word recognition: A study of American and Chinese learners of Japanese,"Lexical judgment tests using Japanese kana (a syllabic script: hiragana and katakana) were performed on 45 English and 17 Chinese speaking learners of Japanese. Visual familiarity and word length in words were controlled to examine phonological/visual dependence in word recognition. Visual familiarity was tested using three types of word stimuli: visually familiar, visually unfamiliar and nonword. Visually familiar words were kana words written in a conventional script (katakana words which are conventionally written in katakana and hiragana words which are conventionally written in hiragana). Visually unfamiliar words were written in an unconventional script (katakana words which are conventionally written in hiragana and hiragana words which are conventionally written in katakana). Nonwords were pronounceable, but not actual Japanese words. The stimuli word length varied from 2 to 5 kana letters. English and Chinese subject responses were compared in terms of reaction time and error rate. According to the hypothesis, it was predicted that (1) subject dependence on visual information in words would cause increased response times for unfamiliar word stimuli, and (2) subject dependence on the phonological information in words would cause increased reaction times as word length increased. The results demonstrate several differences between the subject groups tested. First, Chinese subject reaction times increased more than those of English subjects in unfamiliar word conditions versus familiar word conditions. Second, no greater increase in the reaction times of Chinese subjects was observed between unfamiliar word and nonword conditions. Third, differences between the subject groups were more apparent under hiragana conditions than katakana conditions. Fourth, the effects of word length variations on reaction times were stronger among English subjects than among Chinese subjects. These results indicate that (1) Chinese L1 speakers rely more on the visual information in L2 Japanese kana words than do English L1 speakers, and (2) English L1 speakers utilize the phonologic information in words more than Chinese L1 speakers. Accordingly, these findings demonstrate that English and Chinese speaking subjects utilize different word recognition strategies due to the L1 orthographic characteristics and the L1 word recognition strategies are transferred into L2 Japanese kana word recognition.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-l1-orthography-on-l2-word-recognition/docview/304214241/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

The participants were adult French-speaking learners of English who represented a wide range of proficiency in their knowledge of simple past. The analyses examined the degree to which the learners' appropriate and inappropriate use of tense/aspect markers in past contexts supported the predictions of the aspect hypothesis (Andersen and Shirai, 1994; Bardovi-Harlig, 1994), and the degree to which it showed influence from French, their (L1). The findings showed that both factors played a role. French-speaking learners were significantly more successful in using past morphology with telics (accomplishments and achievements) and had the most difficulty with statives. Lexical aspect also appeared to influence the forms that competed for simple past: there was greater use of progressive with activities, and simple present with statives. These findings are consistent with the predictions of the aspect hypothesis, and partially consistent with previous research with L2 learners of English from other L1 backgrounds. Francophones also showed evidence of L1 influence in their inappropriate use of perfect (a French-influenced form) with telics, a finding that has not been reported in previous research. The interpretation of the findings takes into account individual variation and developmental constraints. The thesis concludes with some discussion of the potential implications of the findings for second language pedagogy.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/marking-time-acquisition-tense-grammatical-aspect/docview/304633441/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Cook, Thomas",2006.0,An investigation of shame and anxiety in learning English as a second language,"The influence of shame and anxiety on learning English as a second-language was investigated. The English language experiences of thirty foreign college students in the United States were recorded in fifty hours of clinical interviews and then coded for their emotional and behavioral content. Anxiety as a factor in second-language learning was compared to a discrete emotions approach that explained the same material. These emotions included shame, fear, guilt, distress, and surprise. As part of the analysis, the explanatory power of the anxiety paradigm versus a discrete emotions approach was compared. The discrete emotions approach using shame was found to be superior to the traditional anxiety paradigm. It gave a clearer picture and a better, more fundamental, explanation of the kinds of maladaptive behaviors that interfere with learning a second-language. Shame over one's English language abilities was a prominent factor in the experience of a majority of the interviewees. Avoiding English language situations where shame might be experienced was common. In addition, shame often inhibited full participation in ongoing situations where English was being spoken. Other emotions, especially fear and anger, worked in conjunction with shame to inhibit learning English. A shame-fear cycle was identified where fear of shame turned out to be a major factor in English language avoidance behavior. A shame-anger relationship was also identified. In many cases, a shame reaction produced an ensuing anger reaction as a defense. In some cases, the shame was unacknowledged and hidden beneath the anger. The difference between guilt and shame reactions to perceived language failure was also explored. Either one could be set off by equivalent events. Guilt reactions were due to specific localized self-attributions concerning failure, whereas shame was a result of global attributions about the entire self as being deficient. Guilt often resulted in reparative behavior, such as additional second-language engagement or studying harder. Shame commonly fostered avoidance and withdrawal behavior. This study found that anxiety is an umbrella term for at least five discrete emotions and suggests that a discrete emotions approach can be used to re-evaluate existing work concerning the role of anxiety in learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigation-shame-anxiety-learning-english-as/docview/305275211/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Currah, Satomi",2002.0,Processing Japanese adnominal structures: An empirical study of native and non-native speakers' strategies,"In Japanese, noun phrases (NP) can be modified by preceding clauses (CL). In this study, four types of noun modifying constructions (NMC) are recognized. In the Regular Relative (RR), the NP is a part of the proposition that the CL expresses. In the Gapless Relative (GR), the NP is a part of the proposition of which an unexpressed verb is also a part. In the Complement (COMP), the NP is the name of what the CL denotes. In the Clause and Noun Host Type (CN), the NP is a name of a participant in the proposition expressed by the CL. Compared to English, the Japanese RR is equivalent to a relative clause and the COMP to a complement with a nominal head. A markedness relation, in terms of the resources required for processing, is proposed to characterize the distinction among the four types. In the absence of prior empirical studies investigating how speakers of Japanese comprehend NMCs, a series of experiments was designed to determine what kinds of cues are used by Japanese native speakers and English speaking learners of Japanese to comprehend NMCs. The experiments involved 23 Japanese native speakers and 11 English Japanese as a second language learners (English JSLs) who were given sets of sentences containing the four types of NMC and were asked to rate them in terms of naturalness and ease of understanding. In addition, English JSLs did a translation task under a time constraint, and finally, both groups carried out a task in which reading speed and probe recognition times were measured. Native speakers use different processing resource domains as a cue, making distinction among the four types as follows: GR involves the largest resource domain and COMP the least, while CN and RR make intermediate demands on processing resources. The same cue is used by English JSLs; additional cues used by English JSLs are the elements involved in forming cohesion between the CL and the NP, such as a gap, semantics of the NP, the NP's status in the proposition, and the number of roles the NP plays. Transfer also plays a role.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-japanese-adnominal-structures/docview/305506179/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Czeczulin, Annalisa Olivia",2007.0,The Russian reflexive in second -language acquisition: Binding preferences and L1 transfer,"This dissertation investigates knowledge of reflexives by adult English-speaking learners of Russian as a second language. The study uses an experimental methodology to ascertain the extent to which a speaker’s native language (L1) influences his or her acquisition of the second language (L2). The thesis concerns L2 acquisition of the reflexive object pronoun sebja, the reflexive possessive pronoun svoj, and the post-verbal affix -sja and investigates the claim that unlike in English, in Russian some anaphors may be bound long-distance (LD) outside non-finite embedded clauses. Twenty non-native and ten native speakers of Russian were tested during the first experiment, and ten non-native and ten native speakers during the second experiment. The experiments were based on Bennett and Progovac (1993) and White et al. (1997). The first experiment found that the more proficient the L2 speakers become, the more their binding pattern reflects that of the L1 informants, suggesting that the L2 subjects depend on their L1 parameters and settings to bind in the L2, but that this dependence wanes as they become more proficient. L2 learners of Russian maintain their L1 AGR parameter in the L2, but transfer their L1 X max binding type at first. Following training, L2 subjects showed greater sensitivity to ambiguity of reference for sebja than native Russian speakers or overgeneralized the training. Although no resetting of parameters was observed during the research, the possibility of resetting parameters looks promising. This resetting will vary across reflexive and sentence types. The second experiment, which evaluated the effects of preferences and pragmatics on binding, suggests that two grammars exist in Russian speakers and that language change may be underway in Russian where LD anaphora are concerned. The L2 subjects were less successful in this experiment and violated the c-command requirement for reflexives. LD binding could be induced through introduction of a verb of power in combination with a LD antecedent deemed to have control over the local antecedent.

Yoshimi,2001.0,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: Explicit instruction and JFL learner's use of interactional discourse markers,"Introduction The development of L2 pragmatic competence entails the ability to use a wide range of conversational routines and discourse strategies to manage one's communicative interactions with others. Since the early 1980s, researchers have established that a foreign language learner's development of various aspects of pragmatic competence may be facilitated by the instruction of pragmatic routines and strategies in the foreign language classroom (Kasper, this volume). House (1996, p. 247) points out that when such instruction is explicit, it appears to be particularly beneficial since it enables learners to develop an awareness and understanding of the differences between L1 and L2 pragmatic preferences, and thereby “counteract negative L1 transfer through ‘noticing’ (Schmidt, 1993b) and through making attempts to use alternative, more L2 norm-oriented expressions.” In a comparison of the relative benefits of implicit and explicit instruction, House (1996) reports on two sections (i.e., implicit and explicit) of a 14-week communication course instructed in the use of everyday, conversational routines. Through lectures, handouts, and explanatory feedback that provided metapragmatic information on the use and function of these routines, the members of the explicit group had additional opportunities to raise their awareness of preferred L2 pragmatic practices and to “notice” differences between L1 and L2 practices. House argues that the greater improvement shown by the explicit group, particularly in areas where the pragmatic preferences of the learners' L1 differed from those of the target L2, is a result of the learners' heightened awareness of L1-L2 pragmatic differences.",,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.016,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139524797.016,ancestry

An index was used to estimate the proportion of effect size variance associated with various study features. Study methods accounted for nearly as much variability in study outcomes as characteristics of the interventions. Type of research design and operationalization of the dependent variable were the method features associated with the largest proportion of variance. The variance as a result of sampling error was about as large as that associated with the features of the interventions studied. These results underscore the difficulty of detecting treatment outcomes, the importance of cautiously interpreting findings from a single study, and the importance of meta-analysis in summarizing results across studies.",,10.1037/1082-989X.6.4.413,https://doi.org/10.1037/1082-989X.6.4.413,ancestry
"Davy, Belinda Lee",2000.0,A cognitive -semantic approach to the acquisition of English prepositions,"This dissertation investigates conceptual transfer as a constraint on the acquisition of English locative prepositions. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lexical-semantic transfer and prototypicality effects adequately account for the specific problems which native Japanese speakers encounter in the acquisition of three English prepositions. The question under investigation is whether interaction of native language spatial schemata, and language-specific semantic and pragmatic strategies associated with two Japanese locatives: de and ni , inhibits the attainment of native-like usage of in, on and at . A preliminary study was conducted which suggested that English and Japanese speakers do not conceive of spatial relationships in the same way. Motivated by the results of the preliminary study, the main study was conducted to test the hypothesis that errors in prepositional usage are symptomatic of two fundamental problems: (1)&#xa0;transfer of an L1 lexical underspecification strategy, which results in overgeneralization of the preposition at, and (2)&#xa0;a failure to construct and implement language-appropriate mental representations of spatial concepts and spatial relations. The study was conducted in two parts. First, a sentence priming task and a grammaticality judgment ranking task were administered to a group of adult Japanese students studying English in the United States. Next, a non-verbal spatial categorization task was administered to both native English-speaking and native-Japanese speaking college students. The validity of a general theory of lexical-semantic transfer and a theory of prototype transfer was confirmed, especially among low-level learners. However, the results suggest that Japanese do not merely transfer lexicon; they also transfer native language semantic and pragmatic strategies. The data also confirmed that English and Japanese speakers often construct very different schematizations of the same real world spatial event. It appears that these culturally-specific viewpoints are also subject to transfer, resulting in similar prepositional usage errors regardless of the level of the learner.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/cognitive-semantic-approach-acquisition-english/docview/304611763/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Dehart, Jerold A.",2008.0,Visual text support for Japanese second language thesis writers,"This dissertation describes an instructional methodology that incorporates visuals and visual learning to support students at a Japanese university who were acquiring English as a second language (ESL) and were required to write a thesis in English. Recognizing that the ESL students at this university were still developing English language skills and that Japanese people have a preference for visual learning (Reid, 1987), an action research team of faculty and supervisors came together to develop visual text support for Japanese second language learners. Using Paivio's (1971) dual coding theory to explain thesis writing, a visually augmented thesis writing textbook was designed. This action research project describes the action research process of the development of the textbook and includes responses of faculty, supervisors, and students in the initial pilot of the textbook. Future research is recommended to complete this action research project and to initiate further research to deepen understanding of visual text support for English-language learners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/visual-text-support-japanese-second-language/docview/304822515/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Dhanesschaiyakupta, Ubon",2003.0,L1 orthography: The effects on L2 word recognition of Thai and Chinese ESL learners,"This study investigated the effects of L1 (first language) orthography on L2 (second language) word recognition. The issue investigated was whether word recognition mechanism developed and used in reading in one orthography is transferred to reading in another orthography, regardless of the degree of similarity in the structural and representational properties of the two orthographies. Previous cross-linguistics research has suggested that readers with different L1 orthographies develop different L1 mechanisms, which differentially affect their L2 word recognition mechanisms. This study tested this issue. Two experimental tasks—naming and homophone judgment—were conducted with 70 adult L2 learners of English with contrasting L1 orthographic backgrounds (Thai and Chinese) and 20 native speakers of English (for a native baseline). The lexicality in stimuli in the naming task and the relationships between the cohort and core words in the homophone judgment task were controlled to explore the participants' dependence on phonological information in word recognition. The performances of the two ESL groups were compared on the basis of reaction time and accuracy. The results for the naming task indicate (a)&#xa0;faster and more accurate recognition via the phonological mechanism used by the Thai group relative to the orthographic mechanism used by the Chinese group; (b)&#xa0;the influence of the frequency effect on the performances of the two groups; and (c)&#xa0;the influence of the expected regularity effects on the performance of the Thai group and of the unexpected regularity effects on the performance of the Chinese group. The results for the homophone judgment task reveal (a)&#xa0;faster recognition of the Thai group compared with the Chinese group, indicating more facilitation imposed by the mechanism used by the Thai group than by the mechanism used by the Chinese group; and (b)&#xa0;stronger effects of the inconsistency between spelling and sound on the Chinese than on the Thai groups. These findings show that Thai readers rely more on phonological information, while the Chinese readers depend more on visual information. Findings indicate that the native Thai and Chinese readers utilize different word recognition mechanisms developed as a consequence of the characteristics of their L1 orthographies, and those word recognition mechanisms are transferred into L2 English word recognition.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l1-orthography-effects-on-l2-word-recognition/docview/305315943/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Doris Dippold,2009.0,Face and self-presentation in spoken L2 discourse: Renewing the research agenda in interlanguage pragmatics,"Abstract This paper introduces a more nuanced view of face and facework than the commonly used frameworks in interlanguage pragmatics. It argues that ILP not only prioritizes research on the expression of politeness in the L2 and the acquisition of politeness strategies, but that the field also does that in an extremely decontextualized manner that takes little account of the situatedness of linguistic discourse. Moreover, the paper suggests that existing accounts of face and facework with their focus on politeness alone may not be sufficient to capture speakers' projection of other aspects of self-hood, i.e. the social identities and/or attributes that they want to foreground and be attributed with in particular situations. By analyzing an argumentative conversation of two L2 learners of German, the paper shows different ways in which self-presentation is performed, e.g., by the way speakers organize their turns, the way they modalize their discourse, and the way they use markers of reference and identity. It then argues that the field of interlanguage pragmatic should move away from its focus on politeness in a limited set of speech acts and focus also on self-presentation.",,10.1515/IPRG.2009.001,https://doi.org/10.1515/IPRG.2009.001,forward
"Dykman, Elizabeth",2000.0,Exploring second language acquisition and acculturation through autobiographical texts: A qualitative study of second language learners/authors,"This qualitative study examined early stages of second language (L2) learning and acculturation experiences through autobiographical texts (as well as interviews conducted with its authors), such as Eva Hoffman's Lost in Translation , Richard Rodriguez' Hunger of Memory , and Natasha Lvovich's The Multilingual Self , and juxtaposed them against relevant second language acquisition theories and constructs. The research has shown that despite the authors/learners' initial culture shock they became successful language learners, and their published books attest to that. The study also revealed that the participants' share in common their negative reactions to the sounds of English, an interesting affective factor, which has not been previously identified in L2 literature. Moreover, the participants share a remarkable bond with their respective families, and their concern for their family's well being appears to be one of the dominating themes in their lives. Although the authors/learners' experiences appear to coincide in a number of ways, I have also found instances, which clearly set them apart. Using Rodriguez, Hoffman and Lvovich's membership in a number of linguistic and cultural affiliations as an example, we have ample evidence to suggest that language learners are able to maintain more than one language and culture, without necessarily giving up one to acquire the other. This outcome clearly contradicts the position advocated by uni-linear socio-cultural models, which emphasize the inability of minority learners to partake simultaneously in multiple sociolinguistic units.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-second-language-acquisition/docview/304617631/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

From this same approach, a review of theoretical perspectives on pragmatic learning and how they have been operationalised in interlanguage pragmatic research is presented. Second, by paying attention to studies on learning the speech act of requesting that have been conducted in the EFL classroom, the author addresses the issue of whether cognitive and socially-oriented theories are complementary and, if so, how they can be integrated into classroom research on pragmatics. Taking into account the debate between positivism and relativism in SLA theory construction, here the author suggests relativism as a viable paradigm in research on interlanguage pragmatics. At the same time, language classrooms are presented as settings where cognitive and socially-oriented approaches can merge, and new perspectives on investigating pragmatic learning in foreign language contexts arc discussed.",,10.1515/IRAL.2008.008,https://doi.org/10.1515/IRAL.2008.008,ancestry

"Eda, Sanae",2004.0,Processing of intonation patterns in Japanese: Implications for Japanese as a foreign language,"Accent and intonation in foreign language instruction tend to be treated in a haphazard manner for two reasons: lack of research analysis that can be applied to the second language acquisition (SLA) situation; and absence of pedagogical materials that effectively train learners on this aspect of the target language. Japanese language instruction at all levels will benefit from both deductive and inductive instructions on accent and intonation at the level of utterance and discourse. Such a seemingly challenging task can be accomplished by using a computerized exercise that involves the effects of various accent and intonation patterns. The experimental study presented in this dissertation examined the processing of three types of prosodically marked syntactic and pragmatic contrasts by native and non-native speakers of Japanese. Three results are salient. First, there was a statistically significant difference between the performance of native and non-native speakers in both the discrimination and the interpretation tasks. Second, while non-native speakers performed equally well in the discrimination task regardless of their proficiency, their performance in the identification task was strongly predicted by their proficiency. Finally, native speakers of the Tokyo dialect and speakers of other dialects performed differently on the interpretation task. As an extension of the investigation, I propose ways to make the topic of accent and intonation a part of the curriculum at all levels of instruction. I will also demonstrate a computer program currently being developed to help Japanese students improve their communicative effectiveness by directing their attention to the effects of variation in accent and intonation patterns.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-intonation-patterns-japanese/docview/305138079/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Egi, Takako",2004.0,"Recasts, perceptions, and L2 development","The present study addressed the following under-explored issues: (1)&#xa0;learners' perceptions about recasts (i.e., as the interlocutor's response to content, negative evidence, and/or positive evidence), (2)&#xa0;relationship between learners' perceptions about recasts and different features of recasts, and (3)&#xa0;relationship between learners' perceptions about recasts and their subsequent L2 learning. While previous research has supported claims about the facilitative effects of recasts in SLA, there is considerable controversy regarding the precise developmental benefits of recasts. Researchers generally agree on the need for positive evidence; however, the role of negative evidence has been controversial. Given the multiple discourse functions of recasts, they are often perceived as interlocutors' reactions to content rather than corrective feedback. Researchers have suggested that such an interpretation of recasts may limit their developmental benefits. Under the premise that learners' perceptions about recasts may constrain their utility, the present study investigated a possible link between learners' perceptions about recasts and L2 learning to examine the developmental benefits of recasts. Forty-nine high-beginning to intermediate learners of Japanese carried out communicative tasks with a native speaker, during which they received recasts of their non-targetlike productions of targeted items (the te -form verbs and numeral classifiers). Short-term and more sustained learning was assessed by a combination of standard and customized immediate and delayed posttests. The learners' perceptions about recasts were measured by immediate reports (Egi, in press) or stimulated recall (Gass &amp; Mackey, 2000). The study provided a finely grained analysis of learners' various perceptions about recasts. A significant relationship was found between their perceptions about recasts and (1)&#xa0;the length of recasts and (2)&#xa0;the number of changes made to the learner's original utterance. Furthermore, the study empirically supported the claim that recasts are ineffective when learners perceive them as responses to content. A (non-significant) trend suggested that there may be greater benefits for recasts when learners perceive them as positive evidence rather than as negative evidence. In summary, this study suggests that the utility of recasts may in part be constrained by learners' perceptions about recasts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/recasts-perceptions-l2-development/docview/305187947/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Eli Hinkel,2006.0,Current Perspectives on Teaching the Four Skills,"This article presents an overview of recent developments in second language (L2) teaching and highlights the trends that began in the 1990s and the 2000s and are likely to continue to affect instruction in L2 skills at least in the immediate future. Also highlighted are recent developments in instruction as they pertain specifically to the teaching of L2 speaking, listening, reading, and writing. In the past 15 years or so, several crucial factors have combined to affect current perspectives on the teaching of English worldwide: (a) the decline of methods, (b) a growing emphasis on both bottom-up and top-down skills, (c) the creation of new knowledge about English, and (d) integrated and contextualized teaching of multiple language skills. In part because of its comparatively short history as a discipline, TESOL has been and continues to be a dynamic field, one in which new venues and perspectives are still unfolding. The growth of new knowledge about the how and the what of L2 teaching and learning is certain to continue and will probably remain the hallmark of TESOL’s disciplinary maturation.",,10.2307/40264513,https://doi.org/10.2307/40264513,forward

Based on the knowledge that we have to date on apology speech act behaviour, we addressed ourselves to questions relating to the efficacy of teaching such elements as: choice of semantic formula; appropriate length of realization patterns; use of intensifiers; judgment of appropriacy and students' preferences for certain teaching techniques. In order to attempt and answer these questions we carried out a training study with I8 adult learners of English, speakers of Hebrew. The study consisted of : a) a pre-teaching questionnaire aimed at assessing the subjects' use of apologies; b) a teaching materials packet covering three classroom sessions and c) a postteaching questionnaire. The findings suggest that although we cannot present clear cut quantitative improvement of the learners' speech act behaviour after the given training programme, we find that there is an obvious qualitative approximation of native like speech act behaviour with respect to types of intensification and downgrading, choice of strategy and awareness of situational factors. We feel, therefore, that the teaching of speech act behaviour is a worthwhile project even if the aim is only to raise the learners' awareness of appropriate speech act behaviour.",,10.18806/TESL.V7I2.568,https://doi.org/10.18806/TESL.V7I2.568,ancestry

Thirty adult speakers of English as a second language at the intermediate level and ten native speaker controls were tape recorded in both oral reading and free speech tasks. The speech data were analysed on a Visipitch machine to measure how pitch and intensity were used contrastively to show relationships in discourse. Following a model of intonational meaning dev-eloped by Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, pitch accents, phrase accents, boundary tones, and para-tones were measured.

This study investigated the effect of functional-analytic teaching on aspects of French immersion (FI) students sociolinguistic competence at the Grade 8 level. A set of functional-analytic materials, entailing the study and practice of sociostylistic variation, was implemented in three FI classrooms by their respective teachers during French language arts classes over an average period of five weeks. A pre-test, an immediate post-test, and a delayed post-test were administered to the experimental group as well as to a comparison group in order to compare classes on three measures of sociolinguistic competence (defined as the ability to recognise and produce socially appropriate language in context). The study demonstrated that functional-analytic teaching substantially improved aspects of FI students' sociolinguistic competence in at least three ways: (1) by significantly increasing their ability in oral production to appropriately and accurately use vous in formal situations; (2) by significantly increasing their ability in written production to appropriately use vous in formal letters, and, in the short run, to use polite closings in formal letters; and (3) by significantly increasing their ability to recognise contextually appropriate French. speakers showed that: (1) the present perfect serves as the dominant past tense form for main verbs in the German colloquial standard; (2) modal verbs, the copula sein 'be,' haben 'have,' and certain formulaic expression occur in the preterite; and (3) the use of the past tense forms is linked to contextual and social factors. A German syllabus, then, must include a discussion of verb type when presenting the everyday use of the German preterite and present perfect. The study points to the situational and social contexts influencing the use of grammatical structures rather than merely presenting contextless rules governing their use. This study examines the role of illustrations in language learning and presents an analysis of the illustration content of 18 texts for teaching introductory Spanish published between 1960 and 1989.

The study demonstrated that functional-analytic teaching substantially improved aspects of FI students' sociolinguistic competence in at least three ways: (1) by significantly increasing their ability in oral production to appropriately and accurately use vous in formal situations; (2) by significantly increasing their ability in written production to appropriately use vous in formal letters, and, in the short run, to use polite closings in formal letters; and (3) by significantly increasing their ability to recognise contextually appropriate French. speakers showed that: (1) the present perfect serves as the dominant past tense form for main verbs in the German colloquial standard; (2) modal verbs, the copula sein 'be,' haben 'have,' and certain formulaic expression occur in the preterite; and (3) the use of the past tense forms is linked to contextual and social factors. A German syllabus, then, must include a discussion of verb type when presenting the everyday use of the German preterite and present perfect. The study points to the situational and social contexts influencing the use of grammatical structures rather than merely presenting contextless rules governing their use. This study examines the role of illustrations in language learning and presents an analysis of the illustration content of 18 texts for teaching introductory Spanish published between 1960 and 1989. It also discusses the appropriate use of illustrations in teaching and considers future prospects.",,10.1017/S0261444800007953,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0261444800007953,ancestry

"Felix-Brasdefer, Julio Cesar",2002.0,"Refusals in Spanish and English: A cross -cultural study of politeness strategies among speakers of Mexican Spanish, American English, and American learners of Spanish as a foreign language","This study investigates the speech act performance of native speakers of Mexican Spanish (SPN-SPN), native speakers of American English (ENG-ENG), and advanced American learners of Spanish as a Foreign Language (ENG-SPN) in refusals in six different situations (two invitations, two requests, and two suggestions) of equal and higher status (N = 60 [20 male subjects per group]) using enhanced role plays and retrospective verbal reports (Cohen 1998; Ericsson &amp; Simon 1993). Variables controlled were: gender, age, L2 Spanish dialect, experience abroad, and proficiency level. Transcripts from the 360 role plays were classified according to refusal strategies including direct and indirect refusals, and adjuncts to refusals. As refusals are complex speech acts which often entail negotiation, the data were examined as refusal sequences throughout the refusal interaction encompassing pre-refusals, head acts, and post-refusals. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. Results showed that learners differed from the SPN-SPN group in the frequency, content, and perceptions of refusal strategies. Significant differences occurred in the use of flat ‘ no ,’ mitigated refusal, alternative, gratitude/appreciation , and agreement . Six strategies not observed in previous studies were identified. Contextual factors, such as the level of social status, social distance, and situation, influenced the number and selection of strategies. Among the learners, negative pragmatic transfer was found in the frequency, content, and social perceptions of refusal strategies. In addition, a lack of sufficient grammatical knowledge prevented learners from refusing appropriately. Lexical and syntactic devices to mitigate the refusal were infrequent in the ENG-SPN group. The difficulty of performing the speech act increased in situations of higher status. Rather than proficiency level, length of stay in the target culture appeared to be a better predictor of pragmatic ability. Retrospective verbal reports were instrumental in providing insights into learners' perceptions of refusals, their linguistic and sociocultural knowledge, and the language of thought preferred to perform the speech act. The concept of ‘face’ is re-examined and it is suggested that group face (Nwoye 1992) applies to the Mexican culture, while individual face better describes the American society. Issues in research methodology and pedagogical implications for the L2 classroom are discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/refusals-spanish-english-cross-cultural-study/docview/276533280/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Fender, Michael John",2001.0,English (ESL) word recognition and word integration skills of Arab and Japanese ESL students,"This study examined the word recognition and word integration skills of Japanese and Arab ESL speakers who were enrolled in intermediate and advanced level courses in two pre-academic ESL program. The purpose for this study was to identify and examine the different types of reading problems that Japanese and Arab ESL students have with on-line, ESL reading skills at the word and sentence level. A lexical decision task was used to examine the word recognition skills of the Japanese and Arab ESL participants. A group of Japanese ESL participants (n = 20) exhibited significantly faster word recognition skills than a proficiency matched group of Arab ESL participants (n = 19). The Japanese ESL group was also more accurate in judging whether stimulus items were English words or non-words, though both groups were comparable in recognizing and judging English words when timed out responses were considered. In contrast, the Japanese and Arab ESL groups read words in a word-by-word, subject-controlled sentence reading task at the same speed. However, the Arab ESL group was significantly more accurate than the Japanese ESL group in integrating words into phrase and clause units and comprehending them. These results indicate that Japanese and Arab ESL students have distinctly different word-level problems, which implicate different ESL learning needs for each group in developing lower-level reading skills necessary for ESL reading proficiency.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/english-esl-word-recognition-integration-skills/docview/250025978/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Fiori-Agoren, Melissa L.",2004.0,The development of grammatical competence through synchronous computer-mediated communication,"This study examined whether consciousness-raising (C-R) in synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) fosters grammatical development; specifically, development of por/para and ser/estar . In order to determine the efficacy of C-R in SCMC, two groups were analyzed; one group was designated as form-and-meaning focused while the other was meaning-focused. Each group engaged in weekly chats and addressed the same discussion topics. Three pre- and post-tests (Elicited Imitation/Sentence Repetition Testing, Grammaticality Preferences Component, and oral examinations) were administered. It was determined that: (1)&#xa0;there were statistically significant differences on the outcomes of the EI/SRT and GPC post-tests in favor of the FFMF group, (2)&#xa0;the FFMF group produced greater quantities and more accurate quantities of language, (3)&#xa0;the FFMF group demonstrated higher levels of syntactic maturity with statistically significant results, did not employ a default form of the copular verb, and actively engaged in corrective feedback strategies, (4)&#xa0;the FFMF and MF groups performed equally well, statistically, on both the post-test orals and in terms of semantic range but the social dynamic that surfaced in each group were distinct, (5)&#xa0;the MF group did not ignore form but employed ser as a default, (6)&#xa0;the instructor exercised the same feedback practices for both groups. It was concluded that C-R on por/para, ser/estar in SCMC most likely fostered the development of those grammatical features to a greater degree than in chat without specific instructions to focus on form. When held responsible for its own C-R in SCMC, consciousness was raised for the FFMF group but students were unable to limit the scope of their focus to por/para, ser/estar alone. Overt evidence reveals that they did focus on ser/estar but there is no such evidence for por/para . However, the global approach to C-R assumed by the FFMF positively impacted development, por/para included. In terms of the MF group, it is concluded that the lack of focusing on por/para, ser/estar did not impede upon development, and that unintentional focus on form was insufficient to facilitate growth to the same degree as deliberate focus, although the MF participants demonstrated awareness to form in SCMC.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-grammatical-competence-through/docview/305146874/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Futaba, Terufumi",1994.0,Second language acquisition through negotiation: A case of non-native speakers who share the same first language,"This dissertation explores whether adult second language learners with the same first language (L1), can assist each others' second language acquisition (SLA) by providing three theoretically important conditions (input modified toward comprehensibility, negative input and the production of comprehensible output) when they are assigned communicative tasks (CTs). Recent SLA research suggests that opportunities for learners to be provided with these conditions can be maximized when both speakers try to negotiate message meaning. The study generated three important questions: (1) Do NNSs negotiate with each other to the extent that NNSs negotiate with native speaker (NS) on CTs? (2) To what extent does this negotiation provide them with each of the three conditions? and (3) What effects do task types, shared L1 and gender pairing have on their negotiation? The data were collected from 15 paired Japanese L1 NNSs as they interacted independently of their teacher in separate dyads during two different CTs. Each task required the spoken interaction of both members of the dyad. Analysis of the data revealed that: (1) NNSs negotiated significantly more in NNSs dyads than in NS-NNS dyads; (2) NNSs provided more negative input in NNS dyads than in NS-NNS dyads; (3) There was no significant difference in input modification between NNSs in NNS dyads and NS-NNS dyads; and (4) There was no significant difference in target like second language production between NNS in NNS dyads and in NS-NNS dyads. Taken together, the results revealed that the NNSs were able to provide each other with all three input and output conditions theorized as necessary for SLA. The study thus suggested that sharing a first language in the foreign language classroom can make a positive contribution to students' SLA.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-through-negotiation/docview/304132104/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

The reason is that English is currently used by people in the world for interaction and communication with each other in order to do international trade or participate in the academic conferences (McKay, 2002). For avoiding miscommunication caused by cultural difference, being familiar with diverse cultures and pragmatics is essential. Studies of Pragmatics emphasize the appropriateness in inter-cultural discourses. Through learning pragmatics, the English speakers' intercultural communication competence should be raised. Their Pragmatic Competence would be better because of knowing cultural differences and being aware of the significance in appropriate languages. In other words, the teaching and learning of pragmatics would release the difficulties of international communications for both native and non-native speakers.",,10.6953/MJ.200712.0091,https://doi.org/10.6953/MJ.200712.0091,forward

G. Kasper,2001.0,Four perspectives on L2 pragmatic development,"L2 learners' development of pragmatic ability has been studied from a variety of theoretical perspectives. This paper seeks to assess the contributions made by different approaches to interlanguage pragmatics as a subfield of Second Language Acquisition. A first approach locates the development of pragmatic ability within a comprehensive model of communicative competence, either examining pragmatics as an autonomous component or in its interaction with grammatical ability. The discussion focuses on the evidence for and against the interdependence of pragmatic and grammatical ability. A second perspective explores pragmatic learning as information processing, with a particular view to the roles of attention, awareness, input, and metapragmatic knowledge. One important question requiring further exploration is whether principles of grammar learning extend to the learning of pragmatics. A third approach investigates pragmatic learning in sociocultural perspective. A key observation has been that pragmatic knowledge emerges from assisted performance, both in student-teacher and peer interaction. The fourth approach is language socialization, investigating how cultural and pragmatic knowledge are jointly acquired through learners' participation in recurring situated activities. In a final section, the paper discusses whether the four perspectives are compatible or mutually exclusive.",,10.1093/APPLIN/22.4.502,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/22.4.502,ancestry

The first role of pragmatics is evident in functionalist (Tomlin 1990) and interactionist (Long 1996) views of SLA. The second role puts pragmatics on a par with morphosyntax, lexis, and phonology in that inquiry focuses on learners' knowledge, use, and acquisition of L2 pragmatics. It is the latter sense of “pragmatics and SLA” that is the focus of this paper.

The investigation focuses on learners' ability to soften the illocutionary force of request utterances by employing a range of external modifiers. Data for the present investigation were elicited at three distinct points of the learners' sojourn in the target language environment: shortly after their arrival, in the middle of their stay and shortly before they returned home to Germany. The data were collected with the help of the Multimedia Elicitation Task (MET) which had been specifically designed for the present study. The MET is a computer based instrument that contains 16 request scenarios. The study examines whether learners varied the use of external modifiers according to the status of their interlocutors and/or the imposition of the request. It also investigates whether their choice of modifiers over time seems to have been influenced by exposure to their L2 in the study abroad context by comparing the data of the German learners of English in England to data collected from 13 German learners of English in Germany with no study abroad experience and also to 15 British English native speakers.",,10.1515/IP.2007.011,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP.2007.011,forward

"Gabriele, Alison",2005.0,The Acquisition of Aspect in a Second Language: A Bidirectional Study of Learners of English and Japanese,"This dissertation investigates the second language (L2) acquisition of aspectual morphology within the framework of formal, truth-conditional semantics (Tarski, 1944; Davidson, 1969). We evaluate the relative contribution of the native language grammar and the input available to the learner in an effort to develop a comprehensive model of the L2 acquisition of aspect. The focus is on the acquisition of the semantics of the forms that mark the progressive in English and Japanese. The two forms, be + ing in English and te-iru in Japanese, interact differently with the lexical aspect of the verb phrase to which they attach. In English, the progressive denotes an event-in-progress interpretation regardless of the verb. In Japanese, achievements such as die are incompatible with a progressive interpretation, allowing only for a resultative interpretation of V+ te-iru (Jacobsen, 1992; McClure, 1995; Ogihara, 1998, 1999; Shirai, 2000, i.a.). The analysis that we adopt, McClure (1995), argues that the difference lies in the truth conditions of the aspectual operator PROD in the two languages. In a controlled, bidirectional, experimental study we investigate the L2 acquisition of this crosslinguistic difference using two tasks: a grammaticality judgment task and an interpretation task. Adult learners from a range of proficiency levels are tested including a group of near-natives in the L2 English study. The results of the interpretation task suggest that learners have more difficulty preempting an interpretation that is not available in the L2, but is an option in the L1. Results also indicate that L2 learners have considerably less difficulty adding an interpretation to their L2 grammar that is not available in the native language. We argue that these results can be accounted for if we consider the role of the input available to the learner. Results also reveal that there are contexts where L2 learners follow developmental patterns similar to L1 learners. We argue that a comprehensive model of the L2 acquisition of aspect must consider not only properties of the learner's grammar but also the role of input and how principles of learnability interact with the learners' grammatical representation in the course of development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-aspect-second-language-bidirectional/docview/193966779/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Gabriele, Alison",2009.0,TRANSFER AND TRANSITION IN THE SLA OF ASPECT: A BIDIRECTIONAL STUDY OF LEARNERS OF ENGLISH AND JAPANESE,"Previous studies have shown that it is particularly difficult for second language (L2) learners to overcome the effects of transfer when they need to unlearn specific aspects of the native language in the absence of explicit input that indicates which properties of the first language (L1) are ruled out by the L2 grammar (Inagaki, 2001; Westergaard, 2003; White, 1991a, 1991b). The present study focuses on the effects of transfer in the domain of aspectual semantics through an investigation of the interpretation of the present progressive in L2 English and the imperfective marker te-iru in L2 Japanese and examines whether L2 learners can rule out interpretations available in the L1 but not in the L2. Japanese learners of English (n = 101), English native-speaker controls (n = 23), English learners of Japanese (n = 31), and Japanese native-speaker controls (n = 33) completed an interpretation task in English or Japanese. The results show that the L2 Japanese learners were more successful than the L2 English learners in both acquiring the semantics of the imperfective in the L2 and ruling out interpretations available only in the L1. It is proposed that successful unlearning depends on both the grammatical complexity of the semantic target in the L2 and the transparency of the input cues available to the learner.

"Goro, Takuya",2007.0,Language -specific constraints on scope interpretation in first language acquisition,"This dissertation investigates the acquisition of language-specific constraints on scope interpretation by Japanese preschool children. Several constructions in Japanese do not allow scope interpretations that the corresponding English sentences do allow. First, in Japanese transitive sentences with multiple quantificational arguments, an inverse scope interpretation is disallowed, due to the Rigid Scope Constraint. Second, Japanese logical connectives cannot be interpreted under the scope of local negation, due to their Positive Polarity. Thirdly, in Japanese infinitival complement constructions with implicative matrix verbs like wasureru (""forget"") the inverse scope interpretation is required, due to the Anti-Reconstruction Constraint. The main goal of this research is to determine how Japanese children learn these constraints on scope interpretations. To that end, three properties of the acquisition task that have an influence on the learnability of linguistic knowledge are examined: productivity, no negative evidence, and arbitrariness. The results of experimental investigations show that Japanese children productively generate scope interpretations that are never exemplified in the input. For example, with sentences that contain two quantificational arguments, Japanese children accessed inverse scope interpretations that Japanese adults do not allow. Also, Japanese children interpret the disjunction ka under the scope of local negation, which is not a possible interpretive option in the adult language. These findings clearly show that children do not acquire these scope constraints through conservative learning, and raise the question of how they learn to purge their non-adult interpretations. It is argued that input data do not provide learners with negative evidence (direct or indirect) against particular scope interpretations. Two inherent properties of input data about possible scope interpretations, data sparseness and indirectness, make negative evidence too unreliable as a basis for discovering what scope interpretation is impossible. In order to solve the learnability problems that children's scope productivity raise, I suggest that the impossibility of their non-adult interpretations are acquired by learning some independently observable properties of the language. In other words, the scope constraints are not arbitrary in the sense that their effects are consequences of other properties of the grammar of Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/language-specific-constraints-on-scope/docview/304852925/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Gregory Taylor,2002.0,Teaching Gambits: The Effect of Instruction and Task Variation on the Use of Conversation Strategies by Intermediate Spanish Students,"Abstract: Gambits are words or phrases that facilitate the flow of conversation by giving the speaker time to organize his or her thoughts, maintain or relinquish the floor, expound on an argument, or specify the function of a particular utterance. This study, based in part on previous research by Wildner-Bassett (1984), examined (1) whether gambit use in Spanish can be taught effectively in the classroom, allowing the student to use gambits appropriately in unplanned speech; (2) how the type of interactional situation (a friendly discussion versus a complaint) affects the production of gambits; and (3) what types of gambits show the greastest increases in use for each interactional situation. Participants were intermediate students. A repeated-measures design was used. Results suggest that students can be taught to use gambits effectively and appropriately in the classroom. In addition, the nature of the interactional situation seemed to make a difference in the ability of the students to produce gambits in spontaneous interaction and in the types of gambits they produced.",,10.1111/J.1944-9720.2002.TB03153.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1944-9720.2002.TB03153.X,ancestry

[...]gestures can be seen as input, raising a range of questions regarding their role in the classroom, and their effects on comprehension and learning more generally. The command of the gestural repertoire of a language is important to the individual learners' communicative efficiency and ""cultural fluency"" (Poyatos 1983) - perhaps less in terms of misunderstandings (Schneller 1988) than in terms of the general integration in the target culture.

Spada",2001.0,Recasts as Feedback to Language Learners,"Some researchers suggest that recasts are effective in showing learners how their current interlanguage differs from the target (Long & Robinson, 1998). Others have argued that recasts are ambiguous and may be perceived by the learner as confirmation of meaning rather than feedback on form (Lyster, 1998a). We review research on the effectiveness of recasts in first and second language acquisition, paying particular attention to how recasts have been defined and how their impact has been assessed in observational and experimental studies. We conclude that recasts appear to be most effective in contexts where it is clear to the learner that the recast is a reaction to the accuracy of the form, not the content, of the original utterance.",,10.1111/0023-8333.00172,https://doi.org/10.1111/0023-8333.00172,ancestry

"HIRAMATSU, MICHIKO",1982.0,AN INDIVIDUALIZED LEARNING PACKAGE PROGRAM IN BEGINNING COLLEGE JAPANESE: A MULTI-MEDIA APPROACH,"Statement of the Problem. Traditional instruction at Foothill Community College seems to have failed to meet the different needs and variations of students, which may have resulted in student dropouts. Therefore, this study was conducted in order to: (1) investigate the nature of the existing problem, i.e., the student dropouts, (2) develop and implement an effective program in an attempt to remove or treat the problem, and (3) assess in a tentative way if the specific program is producing the desired results. Procedure. This study, designed as an action research, investigated the student dropouts in the beginning Japanese classes. As a result, an individualized learning package program was conceptualized and developed. The individualized learning package program involved students' use of the textbook, video and audio cassette tapes, and magnetic-taped flashcards; small group conversation practice sessions with a tutor; and whole class sessions conducted by the instructor. Assessments were made in a tentative way to see if the program was producing the desired results: its effectiveness (1) as an instructional method was tested by content-by-objective-grid criterion-referenced tests; (2) as a remedy for the student dropout problem was examined by analyzing data from tutors' observations of the students and from students' evaluations in questionnaires and course completed forms. Results. The assessments revealed that the students learned satisfactorily. The student expressed favorable feelings towards this program. Although there were two students, out of twenty, who chose to complete two and three units, respectively, instead of the usual four, there were no dropouts. Conclusion. This program, since it was readily available at the students' convenience, was effective for busy students who held jobs; and since the students could learn in private it seemed to help release the students' tension and anxiety. The small group set-up seemed not only effective in conversation practice but also in forming mutual support relationships among the group members which contributed toward preventing dropouts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/individualized-learning-package-program-beginning/docview/303108069/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hagiwara, Akiko",2005.0,Comprehending utterances in Japanese as a first and a second language: Literality and conventionality,"Literality in interpersonal communication has been discussed in language philosophy as well as in psycholinguistics, in which the relationship between what is actually uttered and what is intended has been an issue. The gap between them can be explained in two different ways: one is the conventionality of language use and the other is through inference based on the literal meaning. These two explanations contrast in such a way that the former does not assume that the literal meaning of the utterance necessarily contributes to the generation of its intended meaning, whereas the latter treats the literal meaning as the basis of the inference. Theoretically speaking, it may be possible to categorize non-literal utterances into roughly two types: conventional utterances and non-conventional utterances. For the latter type, if the gap between what is uttered and what is communicated is perceived as small, it can be considered that the utterance is more literal. The present study examined how both native Japanese speakers and learners of Japanese, who are native speakers of American English, perceive three types of utterances, literal utterances (e.g., Kyoo wa shokuji o gochisooshite-itadaite, doomo arigatoo gozaimashita .), non-literal non-conventional utterances (e.g., Kondo baito-dai haittara, watashi ga gochisoo shimasu ne .), and non-literal conventional utterances (e.g., Gochisoo sama deshita .), using a set of multiple-choice questionnaires asking the participants to choose the most likely interpretation of the utterance. Two groups of university students, 60 native speakers of Japanese and 60 native speakers of American English, who had completed two-years of formal Japanese instruction, participated in the study. The effect of the language groups, L1 and L2, was statistically significant (p &lt; .0001) and the interaction between the utterance types and language groups was also significant (p = .0052), while the effect of utterance types was not significant (p = .2911). The most obvious difference between native and non-native speakers of Japanese was found when they interpreted non-literal conventional utterances, while the difference was the smallest for literal utterances. These findings suggest that non-native speakers of Japanese are more likely to fail to comprehend conventionally used indirect utterances that native speakers use frequently in daily communication.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comprehending-utterances-japanese-as-first-second/docview/305002613/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hamilton, Robert Lee",1997.0,Underdetermined binding: An HPSG binding theory and experimental study of adult Japanese learners of English as a Second Language,"In this dissertation I accomplish two main objectives. First, I develop a theory of anaphoric and personal-pronominal binding within the framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) that is empirically more satisfying and internally more coherent than previous accounts, including among others the standard HPSG binding theory of Pollard &amp; Sag (1992, 1994) and the reflexive-marking account of Reinhart &amp; Reuland (1991, 1993). Second, with this theory of binding in view I report on a series of experiments with adult Japanese-speaking learners of English (and native English-speaking controls) designed to investigate whether adult second language (L2) learners are sensitive to the domain of Binding Condition A in English. In the main experiment, 85 L2 subjects and 85 native controls were administered two tasks, a written sentence-completion task for screening purposes and a written truth-value judgment task for measuring subjects' acceptance of nonlocal binding in English. The L2 learners, like the native controls, accepted significantly more nonlocal binding of English reflexive anaphors when the anaphor was in a structural position exempt from Condition A (e.g. the object of certain picture-NPs) than when in a position subject to Condition A (e.g. a direct object), as determined by a logistic regression analysis of the data (z = 3.96, p $&lt;$ 0.0001 for L2 Group; z = 6.70, p $&lt;$ 0.0001 for Control Group). I argue that this outcome constitutes an underdetermined binding pattern for the L2 learners given certain features of the L2 English input and of the learners' native Japanese. This in turn suggests that these adult L2 learners had direct access to Binding Condition A, hence to Universal Grammar.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/underdetermined-binding-hpsg-theory-experimental/docview/304366143/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Haneda, Mari",2000.0,Negotiating meaning in writing conferences: An investigation of a university Japanese-as-a-foreign language class,"Conceived within the frameworks of cultural-historical activity theory, systemic functional linguistics, and situated literacy, this study investigates the form and function of writing conferences in a university foreign-language class, focusing on the relationship among the teacher-student discourse in conferences, students' subsequent text revisions, and other factors affecting their modes of engagement with the writing activity. The study involved 9 students who, over the course of 1 semester, composed texts on 3 different topics as part of classroom activities. Then in conferences with the teacher, they discussed their first drafts, produced second drafts, and, in interviews, reflected on the processes involved. The main sources of data consisted of audio-recordings of the conferences, the students' written products, both first and final drafts, audio-recordings of 3 retrospective interviews, and a questionnaire concerning their ethnolinguistic background. The triangulated sources of data were analyzed through the combined use of quantitative and qualitative methods. Overall, the analyses pointed to the positive effects of the tripartite writing activity. The students as a whole utilized the majority of specific pointers offered during the conferences to revise their first drafts. They also reported the metalinguistic and metacognitive value to them of engaging in the process. Quantitative analyses of the conference discourse and of the relationship between the discourse and the students' revisions showed that the manner in which the students engaged in the writing-related activities was strongly influenced by the revision goals they set themselves, the topics selected for discussion in the conferences, and their target language proficiency. Additionally, qualitative analyses of 5 mini-case studies revealed that, in accounting for the students' differential performance, other factors, which appeared to cut across the proficiency differences, interacted with their target language proficiency in an intricate yet dynamic way. The study suggests the importance of: (a)&#xa0;exploring teacher-student interaction in terms of discourse theory; (b)&#xa0;examining overall patterns of intertextual relationships between students' text revisions and talk around their texts; and (c)&#xa0;taking account of the multiple contexts that shape and are shaped by the writing activity. Methodological and pedagogical implications are also discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/negotiating-meaning-writing-conferences/docview/304665158/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hansell, Mark Donald",1989.0,Lexical borrowing in Taiwan,"The economic, political, and cultural history of 20th century Taiwan has led to a complex interplay of four major languages: Taiwanese, Japanese, Mandarin, and English. This study of the Taiwan loan lexicon examines the processes by which speakers of Taiwanese and Mandarin have replicated foreign vocabulary items in their own languages. The different types of substitution and adaptation (such as phonetic borrowing, calquing, and graphic borrowing) are viewed not as mechanical processes determined by structural differences between donor and recipient languages, but as a menu of options available to recipient-language speakers who employ different borrowing strategies depending on the sociolinguistic setting. Comparison of different borrowing paths (Japanese into Taiwanese, English into Mandarin, Japanese into Mandarin) points up the fact that language-contact conditions and channels of borrowing are the determinant factor in choice of borrowing strategy. The analysis of borrowing presented in this work is based on Weinreich and Haugen, but harks back ultimately to Saussure. Lexical borrowing is defined as the borrowing of a sign (in the Saussurean sense), with the recipient language constructing replicas of both the signifiant and the signifiee out of native materials. This picture is complicated in borrowing between two written languages, since the recipient language can replicate either the written signifiant (as in graphic borrowing) or the spoken signifiant (as in phonetic borrowing). In Mandarin, graphic borrowing between dialects has had a significant effect on the phonetic adaptation of foreign loans. In graphic loans of native Japanese (non-Sino-Japanese) forms, phonetic resemblance between model and replica may be entirely lost. In loans from other languages as well, written Chinese exercises a powerful effect on borrowing through transliteration, indirect dialectal borrowing, folk etymology, and alphabetic borrowing.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/lexical-borrowing-taiwan/docview/303678589/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hasegawa, Tomomi",2007.0,The Critical Period Hypothesis in very early child L2 acquisition of Japanese: The uninevitability of native -like attainment,"Nobody would doubt that young children have a better chance than adults to become native-like in second language (L2) acquisition. Such a claim is commonly found in work framed by the Critical Period Hypothesis (Lenneberg, 1967), and many age-related L2 empirical studies confirm the adage ""the younger the better."" Nevertheless, very little research has investigated whether truly native-like attainment is inevitable when a child is exposed to sustained target language input from very early childhood. This dissertation aims to demonstrate that some seemingly native-like child L2 learners (L2ers), schooled in the target language for years, are indeed not native-like when engaging in linguistically challenging tasks. In this study, such tasks were created with aural comprehension and oral production of various types of Japanese relative clauses (RCs). Since in Japanese, knowledge of case marking is a prerequisite of knowledge of RCs, two inclusion criteria were applied: (a)&#xa0;at least 80% accuracy on nominative and accusative case marking (in a comprehension task); (b)&#xa0;a native-like conversational proficiency rating (based on a picture-narration task). Of the more than 70 naturalistic child L2ers of Japanese who originally participated, 38 passed (age of onset: 0-7; age at testing: 10 or older). In the main analyses, the RC comprehension and production scores of these 38 child L2ers were compared with age-matched native speakers ( n = 17). Group mean comparisons indicated no significant differences between the two groups; however, the child L2 group exhibited substantial within-group variation. Occasionally, some child L2ers, despite ostensible knowledge of Japanese RCs (based on their overall RC comprehension scores), supplied ungrammatical responses in RC production and/or misapplied an RC comprehension strategy from their native language, both of which indicate that these child L2ers are qualitatively different from their native-speaking peers. The findings suggest that there are indeed some child L2ers who are not truly native-like despite their native-like conversational proficiency, and thus that native-like attainment is not inevitable even when L2ers receive sustained target language input from very early on in life. Other issues discussed include the nature of bilingual acquisition, the difference between knowledge and performance, and pedagogical implications.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/critical-period-hypothesis-very-early-child-l2/docview/304846911/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hayashi, Asako",2000.0,"Japanese -English bilingual children: A comparative study of attitudes toward bilingualism, language proficiency, and language use of Japanese students in three different bilingual education programs in the United States and in Japan","This study sought to examine the educational supports that foster the bilingual/bicultural development of Japanese-English bilingual students in three different bilingual education programs. It also investigated the students' attitudes toward bilingualism and toward the Japanese language, their actual language use, and their language proficiency in both Japanese and English. Data concerning the students' attitudes, language proficiencies in both Japanese and English, and language use were obtained from observations, interviews, and questionnaires. The participants of this study were 63 Japanese students total in the 4th/5th grade in an English Immersion Program (EIP) in Japan (N = 30), a Japanese Bilingual Program (JBP) in California (N = 25), and in a Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) in Massachusetts (N = 8). The results of the questionnaire asking about the students' attitudes toward bilingualism indicate that the students in all three programs had positive attitudes toward bilingualism. The students' language use in English and Japanese differed significantly among the three programs. The students in the two programs in the US used English much more frequently than did the students in Japan. The students in Japan had very limited opportunities to use English. Consequently the English proficiency of the students in Japan was much lower than that of the students in the US. In contrast, the students in the US had various opportunities to use Japanese in and outside the school. As a result, the Japanese language proficiency of the students in the US progressed even though their Japanese proficiency was lower than that of the students in the EIP in Japan. The results of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients indicate that language use and language proficiency in each language were highly correlated, while attitudes toward bilingualism and toward the Japanese language were not correlated with language use or language proficiency. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the importance of a balanced use of the two languages for bilingual development. Family, school, and community supports are crucial in order to maintain that balanced use of the two languages. In addition, it is important to clarify that family, school, and community should cooperate with each other to create environments in which bilingual children can develop their bilingual proficiency.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/japanese-english-bilingual-children-comparative/docview/304583656/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Hertel, Tammy Jandrey",2000.0,The second language acquisition of Spanish word order: Lexical and discourse factors,"The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the acquisition of Spanish word order by native English speakers. Specifically, I investigate the development and attainment of sensitivity to the distinct interpretations of subject-verb (SV) versus verb-subject (VS) order, as determined by lexical class and discourse structure. There are two classes of intransitive verbs, unaccusatives and unergatives, whose distinct lexical representations are reflected in different word order preferences in Spanish. While the discourse neutral order for unaccusatives is VS, that of unergatives is SV. When the subject is the focus of a sentence, VS order is elicited for both verb classes. Spanish uses syntactic means to enable focused elements to receive the main sentential stress at the end of a sentence, while English maintains SV order and uses prosody to mark focus. Given this difference between English and Spanish, the lexical projection problem it presents, and the subtle and complex nature of the input, this study investigates the extent to which learners of varying levels of second language proficiency are able to acquire Spanish word order. A native speaker control group and learners of four proficiency levels participated in this study. Participants completed two tasks: a written production task and an aural judgement task. Results from both tasks indicate that beginning learners transferred English SV order for all structures. For the aural task they preferred sentence-internal stress with SV order over the target VS order with sentence-final stress. Intermediate learners showed a gradual increase in the production of and preference for inversion with unaccusatives and focused subjects, although their data was also characterized by indeterminacy and variability. Advanced learners demonstrated a native-like sensitivity to the word order effects of unaccusativity and discourse factors, but they tended to overgeneralize inversion with unergatives in neutral discourse contexts. The difficulties that learners experience with these aspects of Spanish word order can be attributed to the ambiguous and subtle nature of the L2 input. Both the developmental path of acquisition and the residual indeterminacy found in advanced learners' grammars are consistent with the lexical view of parametric change that follows from the Minimalist Program.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-spanish-word-order/docview/304634379/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hirakawa, Makiko",2000.0,Unaccusativity in second language Japanese and English,"This thesis investigates L2 acquisition of intransitive verb constructions in Japanese and English. Within the Generative framework, the Unaccusative Hypothesis has been proposed, which divides intransitive verbs into two syntactically distinct classes: unergatives and unaccusatives (Burzio 1986). The sole argument of unergative verbs is an Agent generated in subject position, whereas that of unaccusative verbs is a Theme or Patient base-generated in object position. While the unaccusative/unergative distinction at the level of Deep (D)-Structure holds universally, as derived by a universal principle called the Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (UTAH, Baker 1988), languages differ as to where the underlying object of unaccusatives may be positioned at the level of Surface (S)-structure. In the case of English, it surfaces in the subject position where it receives Nominative Case. In the case of Japanese, on the other hand, it has been argued that the argument of unaccusative verbs remains in its base-generated object position and that Nominative Case is assigned within the Verb Phrase. Experimental studies are conducted to examine learners' knowledge of unaccusativity at the two levels, i.e. D-Structure and S-Structure. It is hypothesized that learners will show sensitivity to unaccusativity at D-Structure, but that they may not acquire the correct representation of unaccusativity in the L2 at S-Structure, at least in an earlier stage. The first two studies present the L2 acquisition of English by Japanese speakers. The next two studies are concerned with the L2 acquisition of Japanese by English speakers. Overall, results of the four studies confirm the hypotheses, and L2 learners appear to have problems where the L1 manifests a different representation from the L2. Nevertheless, it is observed that L2 learners behavior is not random even when difficulty arises, in that the L2 learners are often consistent with one class of verbs, but not with the other. Thus, it is suggested that the L2 acquisition of intransitive verb constructions is constrained by universal principles, such as the Unaccusative Hypothesis and the UTAH.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/unaccusativity-second-language-japanese-english/docview/304663562/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hirakawa, Makiko",2001.0,L2 ACQUISITION OF JAPANESE UNACCUSATIVE VERBS,"This paper reports on an experimental study that investigates the acquisition of Japanese unaccusative verbs by English-speaking learners. Following Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1995), it is assumed that unaccusativity is syntactically represented but semantically determined. The experiment is devised specifically to examine whether L2 learners are sensitive to syntactic and semantic properties associated with unaccusative verbs in Japanese, which contrast with the properties of unergative verbs. In particular, the experiment involved picture tasks with two structures: the takusan construction as a syntactic test and the -teiruconstruction as a semantic test. Overall results of the experiment show that L2 learners generally know the properties investigated; that is, that subjects of unaccusative verbs originate in object position, and semantic notions such as telicity and change of state are aspects of meaning relevant to the classification of unaccusativity in Japanese. Based on these results, it is argued that the mapping of verb arguments to syntactic positions is not random, but rule governed, for most of the L2 learners in the present study.

"Hondo, Junko",2009.0,Constructing knowledge in SLA: The impact of timing in form -focused intervention,"In an effort to identify an optimal timing for form-oriented treatment, this dissertation reports on the impact of different timings of form-focused intervention. Applying the theories of attentional control (Cowan, et al. , 2005; LaBerge, 1995), the study further attempts to shed light on the role of preparatory attentional control at the initial stage of form-encoding. A reading task served as a framework for exploring different timings of treatment with 58 EFL students in Japan. The informants were classified into three groups: one group receiving explicit treatment before the task, another during, and a control group receiving no treatment. Participants took pretests and posttests immediately before and after the task in a single class session. These tests examined comprehension of two epistemic meanings of ‘must’ in two individual forms. Working with these task-essential forms, each informant recorded real-time reflections reporting rationales for their selections from different form options in the task. The participants’ rationales revealed that contextualized reflections are strongly associated with higher accuracy levels in choosing between alternate forms. Decontextualized rationales were associated with incorrect selections of forms at a high level of probability. Group difference was highly significant for one form and significant for the other form in the order of Control &lt; Pre-emptive &lt; Delayed group. Effect sizes were large (e.g. 2.00) for the delayed group which outperformed the pre-emptive group. The pattern of the results replicated three prior studies with 286 participants. The overall results present a promising role for delayed treatment reactive to raised preparatory attention. The outcome further confirms that it is through making connections between form and meaning within current language use that learners become successful in language comprehension.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/constructing-knowledge-sla-impact-timing-form/docview/305062523/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

This research examines such key issues as how literacy is affected by the use of CMC, how computers can be used to teach collaboratively and the role of CMC in developing written argument. A shift from print-based literacy to interactive electronic-based literacy has the potential to transform the nature of both literacy and pedagogy. This project employs a Socio-cultural and Discourse Analysis perspective and investigates the use of CMC in post-graduate education and its effect on academic literacy. It also examines how computer mediated collaboration can effectively aid the process of induction into communities of discursive practice.

"Hosoda, Yuri",2006.0,Repair and Relevance of Differential Language Expertise in Second Language Conversations,"This paper examines the relevance of differential language expertise in ordinary conversation between speakers of Japanese as a first and second language. Adopting a conversation analytic perspective, the study focuses on other-repair as one sequential environment in which the participants recurrently orient to their differential linguistic knowledge. Specifically, it will be shown that language expertise was made relevant (a) when one participant invited the other party's repair and (b) when the participants encountered a problem in achieving mutual understanding. On such occasions, the interlocutors oriented to the differences in their linguistic knowledge through their talk and other interactional conduct. The study thus provides evidence for differential language expertise as a participant category that emerges on occasion but bears no relevance for the participants during most of their talk.", Journal Article,,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/repair-relevance-differential-language-expertise/docview/203935589/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Hsieh, Hui-Chen",2007.0,"Input -based practice, feedback, awareness and L2 development through a computerized task","The importance of practice in learning has been accounted for in cognitive psychology by automatic processing (e.g., Schneider, Dumais &amp; Shiffrin, 1984) or by the skill acquisition theory (e.g., Anderson, 1996). In SLA, although focusing learner attention to form is still a debate (Krashen, 1994; Long &amp; Robinson, 1998), there is currently a movement to define input-based practice as a task feature in which learner attention to form is important for successful performance (e.g., Leow, 2007; Sanz &amp; Morgan-Short, 2005). Empirical support for the input-based practice in L2 development comes from the attentional framework (e.g., Rosa &amp; Leow, 2004) and processing instruction (e.g., Sanz &amp; Morgan-Short, 2004) studies. However, a careful review revealed that feedback had not been teased out from input-based practice, leading to the question of whether it was input-based practice or feedback independently, or a combination of the two that contributed to subsequent L2 performance. Additionally, the construct of attention and awareness has only been operationalized in some research designs (e.g., Rosa &amp; Leow, 2004; Rosa &amp; O'Neill, 1999). This study investigated (1)&#xa0;the effects of input-based practice and type of feedback on college-level L2 beginning learners' development of the Spanish gustar , and (2)&#xa0;the relationship between levels of reported awareness and treatment conditions. Both a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest and a split-block design including oral, written and recognition tests were employed. Online think-aloud protocols were coded and analyzed. The results indicated that input-based practice did not appear to have an overall significant role in learners' L2 development. However, when collapsed with the feedback, input-based practice appears to have promoted a higher level of reported awareness on some linguistic subcomponents. It was the feedback rather than the input-based practice that appeared to facilitate the gustar development by influencing learners' awareness of the relevant linguistic structure although caution is advised given the lack of statistical power due to small sample sizes. Finally, the results also demonstrated that, irrespective of the levels of reported awareness, the participants performed similarly in the oral, written and recognition tests on almost all the linguistic subcomponents of gustar (except for les in recognition).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/input-based-practice-feedback-awareness-l2/docview/304875881/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Husseinali, Ghassan T. A.",2006.0,Processability and development of syntax and agreement in the interlanguage of learners of Arabic as a foreign language,"This study investigated the development of the interlanguage of learners of Arabic as a foreign language from a processability perspective as presented in Pienemann (1998). Pienemann's Processability Theory (PT) procedures were applied to seven syntactic structures of Arabic and accordingly three stages of development in the interlanguage (IL) of learners of Arabic as a foreign language (AFL) were predicted. Attributive adjectives were predicted to be acquired at stage 3, followed by predicative adjectives, SV and VS at stage 4. Vcomp (to+Vclause), embedded clauses (that+clause) and adjectival clauses were predicted to be acquired at stage 5. According to PT, second language development should proceed in an implicational hierarchy i.e. no stage skipping. In addition to syntactic development, acquisition of four gender-number agreement combinations on verbs and adjectives was investigated. Data for this study were elicited at two points of time from six AFL learners evenly distributed over three levels on instruction yielding 679 minutes of recording. Data elicitation depended largely on free production. However, in the first two levels picture description was part of the elicitation procedure. The results of this study indicate that although there was no stage skipping, there was variability between structures within the same stage. For example, both VS and SV were predicted to develop at stage 4; however, SV was acquired before VS. In fact, VS word order was acquired only after two other structures in stage 5 were acquired. Among the seven syntactic structures we found an implicational order, independent of stages, represented in five developmental sequences. In terms of gender-number agreement combinations, the findings indicate that, in general, combination in which the number is singular were acquired before combinations in which the number is plural regardless of gender and that combinations in which the gender is masculine were acquired before combinations in which the gender is famine regardless of number. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed in light of input, L1 transfer, markedness and restructuring. In conclusion, this study suggests modifying input to include form-meaning activities following Van Patten's (2002, 2004) Processing Instruction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processability-development-syntax-agreement/docview/304982153/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Hwang, Hyekyung",2007.0,Prosodic phrasing in sentence comprehension: Evidence from native English speakers and native Korean -speaking second language learners of English,"This work investigates the perception and use of prosodic phrasing in the processing of spoken English sentences by English native speakers (L1ers) and Korean second language learners of English (L2ers). The prosodic structures of English and Korean differ in that English intermediate phrases (ips) have more variable tonal patterns and stronger durational cues than Korean accentual phrases, the Korean counterpart. However, the two languages show similar phonetic and phonological properties for intonation phrases (IPhs). Three on- and off-line sentence comprehension experiments test sentences containing a verb in an initial subordinate clause that could be intransitive or transitive, resulting in a temporary syntactic ambiguity between Early and Late Closure of the clause. The results provide new evidence for significant effects of both absolute and relative sizes of prosodic boundaries in establishing phrase structure, showing that both language groups make fine-grained prosodic distinctions during parsing. They support previous claims that parsing decisions are influenced by the overall prosodic representation and that there are separable effects of the two phonologically distinctive levels of prosodic phrasing. Despite a generally consistent role of prosodic structure in sentence processing, there are significant differences in the effects of ips between the two language groups. Intermediate prosodic boundaries provide markedly weaker evidence for syntactic boundaries for Korean L2ers than for English L1ers, but the L2ers performed similarly to the L1ers with IPh boundaries. A following discrimination experiment demonstrates that the differential effects of ips are not due to perceptual differences between L1ers and L2ers. I argue from these results that there exist universal underlying processing principles that govern the role of prosodic phrasing. The different prosodic effects seem likely to stem from categorizing a phonetic pattern as an ip or forming prosody-syntax mappings, which sheds light on the Korean L2ers' developmental stage in perceiving and processing English prosody. Taken together, this dissertation contributes to the L2 literature, in which little is known with respect to the acquisition of prosody and the role of prosody in processing. It also provides further insights for L1 processing by discriminating among hypotheses for the use of prosody in sentence comprehension.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/prosodic-phrasing-sentence-comprehension-evidence/docview/304846867/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Inutsuka, Kumiko",2009.0,Component skills analyses for Japanese adult second language readers: The role of cognitive and linguistic skills and processing speed in predicting reading performance,"The research addressed two theoretical issues: the role of lower-level processing skills in reading and the transfer of first language (L1) processing skills to second language (L2) reading among adult Japanese learners of English. The component skills of word recognition are crucial predictors of literacy acquisition for English children and adult English as a second language (ESL) readers (Koda, 2005). Nassaji and Geva (1999) demonstrated the importance of these skills for adult L2 readers whose first language was alphabetic (Farsi). However, the involvement of these processes in the English L2 reading performance of adults whose L1 orthography is typologically distant is still unclear. The first study investigated whether component processing skills explained the English L2 reading performance of Japanese students, whose L1 orthography is nonalphabetic. The second study addressed the issue of L1 - L2 transfer. Some aspects of word recognition processing, such as phonological processing, transfer cross-linguistically between alphabetic languages and also between typologically distant languages for bilingual children. It is not clear whether this holds true for adult readers who acquire their L2 literacy subsequent to their L1 literacy. The second study investigated whether this transfer can be observed for the EFL (English as a foreign language) reading of Japanese adults. The accuracy and speed of processing skills at the word and text levels in English and Japanese were analyzed for 62 Japanese undergraduate students learning English in Japan. Their cognitive, linguistic, and sub-word processing skills were measured. The results of the first study underscore the importance of phonological and orthographic processing skills in explaining adults' L2 reading performance at the word and text levels. The study adds to the literature that discusses the importance of lower-level processing skills for the reading performance of second language learners (Grabe, 1988; Koda, 1996, 2005; Nassaji &amp; Geva, 1999). In the second study, there was a limited correlation between the L1 and L2 accuracy scores, possibly reflecting orthographic differences. Although the participants' L1 and L2 phonological processing skills did not correlate, the speed of executing tasks correlated between English and Japanese, suggesting that processing speed may be an underlying skill.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/component-skills-analyses-japanese-adult-second/docview/305104893/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Ishida, Kazutoh",2009.0,Indexing stance in interaction: A pedagogical approach to teaching the pragmatic use of the Japanese plain and <i>desu/masu</i> forms,"This study is concerned with Japanese learners' pragmatic development of their understanding and use of the Japanese plain and desu/masu forms. Drawing on the notion of indexicality (Silverstein, 1976; Ochs, 1993a), studies such as Cook (1999) and Okamoto (1998) analyze naturally occurring interactions between Japanese native speakers (NSs) and reveal how they utilize the forms as resources to manage their affective stance in relation to various contextual features. Given that the forms are basic linguistic tools in Japanese for self-expression and relationship building, I argue that teaching the pragmatic functions of the forms cannot and should not be ignored in the early stages of instruction. In this study, I propose an instructional approach to facilitate beginning-level learners' development of pragmatic competence in understanding and using the forms. The approach incorporates awareness-raising and communicative practice components based on findings from previous interventional studies (e.g., Tateyama, 2001; Yoshimi, 2001). In conceptualizing these components and the learning which the approach intends to facilitate, this study draws on the notion of language socialization (Ochs, 1996; Ochs &amp; Schieffelin, 2008). Awareness-raising discussions are considered explicit socialization opportunities for learners to develop understanding of the use of the forms in pragmatically appropriate ways. Conversation sessions with Japanese NSs constitute opportunities for implicit socialization in which learners can assess the indexical meanings of the forms and make informed decisions about using them in interaction. The approach was implemented in two consecutive first-year JFL courses. Twenty learners were enrolled in the experimental courses. To examine the effect of the approach, data were collected from experimental and control groups through (a) questionnaires in which learners assess the appropriateness of the forms, (b) transcriptions of the conversation sessions, and (c) reflection sheets filled out after each conversation session. Analyses of the questionnaires and reflection sheets are consistent in revealing the experimental group learners' deeper understanding of the indexical use of the forms. Moreover, analysis of the conversations shows expanded use of the forms by the experimental group learners with increased attention to a wider range of contextual features. Pedagogical implications and areas for future research are also discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/indexing-stance-interaction-pedagogical-approach/docview/304894561/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Emulating and resisting pragmatic norms: Learner subjectivity and foreign language pragmatic use. Study II. Centering second language (SL) speakers' experience: A study of SL speakers' resistance to pragmatic norms of the SL community. Study III. Web -based curriculum for pragmatics instruction in Japanese as a foreign language: An explicit awareness -raising approach","This dissertation attempts to respond to current gaps in L2 pragmatics education and research in its alternative format with three independent studies. Studies I and II challenge the conventional assumption that acquiring nativelike pragmatic competence is the goal of all learners, and explore L2 speakers' pragmatic L2 use in relation to their subjectivity. Study I investigates the stated reasons that seven advanced Japanese learners provided for their pragmatic choices. Interviews and follow-up e-mail correspondence examined learners' deliberate pragmatic decisions made while performing elicitation tasks. The interviews identified instances where learners intentionally accommodated to or resisted perceived L2 pragmatic norms. The learners largely converged towards L2 norms to emulate the culture, while they sometimes intentionally diverged from L2 norms to resist certain L2 pragmatic uses (e.g., higher-level honorifics). Their agency can be explained by speech accommodation theory (Beebe &amp; Giles, 1984) which views learners' pragmatic decisions as the enactment of their social, psychological, and affective dispositions. L2 speakers' resistance to L2 norms is further investigated in Study II through a phenomenological inquiry into their lived experiences. The meaning of resistance was explored based on six interviews with fluent SL speakers of English and Japanese. These speakers were found to sometimes deliberately diverge from SL norms that conflicted with their own standards to express their subjectivity or to deliberately maintain distance from the SL community. In their acts of resistance, SL speakers negotiated their subjectivity and contested pre-existing SL norms in the community. Study III attempts to respond to the current paucity of L2 pragmatics curriculum/instruction by describing a web-based curriculum and reporting its preliminary effects on learners' pragmatic awareness. In this curriculum designed for intermediate/advanced foreign language learners of Japanese, explicit awareness-raising (Kasper &amp; Schmidt, 1996) tasks guided learners to self-discover a range of L2 pragmatic norms. The curriculum features naturalistic audio samples, empirically-established pragmatic information, explanatory information on L2 norms, and self-evaluation of pragmatic uses. Deductive analysis of 18 learners' reflective journaling demonstrated the range of pragmatic awareness gained through the use of these materials, and revealed that the instruction enhanced pragmatic awareness of different pragmatic aspects by varying degrees.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/subjectivity-second-foreign-language-pragmatic/docview/305311592/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ivanov, Ivan Prodanov",2009.0,Second language acquisition of Bulgarian object clitics: A test case for the Interface Hypothesis,"The primary objective of this dissertation is to expand the testing ground of the Interface Hypothesis, which states that interface properties involving the syntax and other cognitive domains (such as discourse) may trigger residual optionality effects at the end-state. The target of investigation were Bulgarian object clitics whose syntactic and discursive properties provide a good testing ground for theoretical approaches to second language acquisition. Ten advanced and 14 intermediate L2 speakers of Bulgarian, as well as a control group of Bulgarian native speakers, participated in the study. The test materials included a proficiency test, a grammaticality judgment task to check syntactic knowledge of clitics, and a pragmatic felicity task. The latter was aimed at investigating the degree to which L2 learners of Bulgarian, with English as their L1, had acquired a syntax-discourse interface property of Bulgarian, namely the pragmatic function of clitic doubling. In Bulgarian, clitic doubling serves as an overt marker of topicality and ‘undoubled’ object topics are deemed infelicitous. The results of the experiments in this dissertation present a challenge to some theoretical approaches to second language acquisition, namely the Interpretability Hypothesis and the Interface Hypothesis. The results showed that the intermediate participants did not differentiate between the felicitous and the infelicitous options in the pragmatic felicity task in a target-like manner as their responses either did not exhibit statistically significant difference or favored the response closest to the L1. However, the advanced L2 learners of Bulgarian had successfully acquired the syntax of clitics as well as the pragmatic meaning of clitic doubling in Bulgarian. They displayed target-like convergence with respect to the syntactic properties of Bulgarian object clitics and distinguished between the felicitous and the infelicitous options in the pragmatic task in a native-like manner. The study highlights the fact that successful learning at the syntax-discourse interface cannot be excluded and a lot more research, exploring as many interface conditions as possible, needs to be done in order to validate the Interface Hypothesis as a legitimate constraint which permanently hinders native-like performance.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-bulgarian-object/docview/304900096/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Iwasaki, Noriko",2000.0,Speaking Japanese: L1 and L2 grammatical encoding of case particles and adjectives/adjectival nouns,"The ultimate objective of this project was to link psycholinguistic theories of sentence production to the study of L2 acquisition. To achieve this goal, two steps were taken: first, some of the specifics of the grammatical encoding processes that occur during L1 Japanese sentence production were investigated; second, L2 Japanese learners’ sentence production processes were examined. Because any L2 data that we can observe is necessarily the product of both speakers’ underlying knowledge and their capacity to process a language, it is important to investigate language processes in order to fully understand L2 development. I studied two processes of both L1 and L2 speakers: (1)&#xa0;lexical retrieval processes for adjectives and adjectival nouns (both of which roughly correspond to English adjectives, but differ from each other in their morphosyntax), by using tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) experiments; and (2)&#xa0;case particle selection, by examining speech errors (e.g., L1 and L2 errors that occurred during picture description experiments, in addition to naturally occurring L1 errors). L2 Japanese speakers also participated in several other tasks, including tasks that assessed their knowledge of adjectives/adjectival nouns and case particles. It was found that both L1 and L2 speakers of Japanese had access to the word category information of a target adjective or adjectival noun during TOT states. Also, L2 learners’ error patterns in a picture description task roughly matched their knowledge of the morphosyntax of adjectives and adjectival nouns. Thus, most of the morphosyntactic errors of adjectives and adjectival nouns were attributed to L2 learners’ knowledge, rather than their lexical retrieval processes or processing strategies. However, L2 speakers’ self-repairs and verbal reports indicated that some morphosyntactic errors occurred due to processing factors. The examination of L1 case particle errors indicated that L1 speakers may use certain sentence processing strategies, two of which involve use of the nominative marker ga (as default), and the selection of a prototypical case particle for a semantic role of an NP. L2 speech errors revealed that L2 Japanese speakers employ word order based processing strategies during sentence production, and that they may also use prototypical particles for NPs having given semantic roles.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/speaking-japanese-l1-l2-grammatical-encoding-case/docview/304579572/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

This article examines how speakers of Japanese as their first language (L1) state and support their opinions. Performances of second language (L2) learners of Japanese were also examined to identify the language abilities that L2 learners may need to develop. While L1 speakers often sought common ground using various mitigation devices such as -zyanai desu ka (""isn't the case that""), -yone (""y'know""), and the modal adverb yappari (""after all, as expected""), L2 learners enrolled in a 4th-year Japanese course rarely sought common ground using these devices. In order to help L2 learners develop their ability to state and support opinions in a socioculturally appropriate way, it is important to provide guided opportunities for them to produce discourse-level exchanges beyond sentence-level opinion statements.

The data are drawn from 55 L2 learners of Japanese at a beginning level of proficiency in an Australian tertiary institution. Five different types of interactional moves made by native speaker interlocutors during task-based interaction were identified, by way of which learners received implicit negative feedback and positive evidence about the two target structures. The relative frequency of each interactional move type was calculated, and associated changes in the learners' performance on immediate and delayed posttests were examined. It was found that, although native speaker interactional moves containing positive evidence about the two target structures were 10 times more frequent during task-based language learning than those containing implicit negative feedback, only learners who had an above-average score on the pretest benefited from the positive evidence provided. Implicit negative feedback, on the other hand, had beneficial effects on short-term development of the grammatical targets regardless of the learner's current mastery of the target structures. Moreover, recasts were found to have a larger impact than other conversational moves on short-term L2 grammatical development.

Typically, telecollaboration involves the application of global computer networks in foreign language study (e.g., Warschauer, 1996) for the purposes of linguistic development and intercultural learning. In particular, we focus on the ‘microgenesis’ or development of the T/V distinction in pronouns of address as a test case representative of broader L2 pragmatic concerns. We present two detailed case studies of this phenomenon: one for French (tu vs. vous) and one for German (du vs. Sie). The rationale for this type of analysis emerges from Vygotsky's developmental approach to cognition (1978) where it is emphasized that development can only be understood by specifying its history.

Félix-Brasdefer,2007.0,Pragmatic development in the Spanish as a FL classroom: A cross-sectional study of learner requests,"Abstract This study investigates the development of requests from the beginning of foreign language instruction to advanced levels of proficiency in face-to-face interactions. Data were collected from three learner groups (American learners of Spanish) (45 learners [15 per group: beginning, intermediate, advanced]). Open role plays were used to collect data in four request situations. Data were analyzed for request head acts (direct, conventional indirect, non-conventional indirect), the request perspective, and internal and external modification. Findings indicate that the beginner group produced the largest number of direct requests. They, thus, showed little competence in situational variation. These direct requests were often realized by means of verbless requests, statements of need, imperatives, and requests with an infinitive used as a main verb. In contrast, a strong preference for conventionally indirect requests was observed among intermediate and advanced learners in formal and informal situations, with a decline in direct requests noted to appear with increasing proficiency. Four stages of pragmatic development among learners in a FL context were identified and discussed in light of existing research in pragmatic development. This study also addresses the issue of the primacy of pragmatics over grammar in expressing pragmatic intent, formula research in interlanguage pragmatics, and pragmatic development in the FL classroom.",,10.1515/IP.2007.013,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP.2007.013,forward

J. C. Félix-Brasdefer,2008.0,Perceptions of Refusals to Invitations: Exploring the Minds of Foreign Language Learners,"Descriptions of speech act realisations of native and non-native speakers abound in the cross-cultural and interlanguage pragmatics literature. Yet, what is lacking is an analysis of the cognitive processes involved in the production of speech acts. This study examines the cognitive processes and perceptions of learners of Spanish when refusing invitations from a person of equal and higher status. Twenty male native speakers (NSs) of US English who were advanced learners of Spanish as a foreign language participated in two refusal interactions with two NSs of Spanish. The perception data were collected through retrospective verbal reports immediately after the role-play task. Results showed that these reports were instrumental in gathering relevant information about learners' cognitive processes with regard to: (1) cognition (attention to information during the planning and execution of a refusal), in particular attention to politeness, discourse, grammar and vocabulary; (2) the selection of the language of thought (English and Spanish) for conveying pragmatic intent; and (3) the perception of insistence after refusing an invitation. The study aims at informing researchers and teachers of the kinds of language-learning (metacognitive) and language-use (retrieval and cover strategies) strategies that learners use to communicate pragmatic intent.",,10.1080/09658410802146818,https://doi.org/10.1080/09658410802146818,forward

Specifically, this study assesses the degree to which Korean ESL (English as a second language) students' preferences for North American English influence their willingness to use Australian-English routines while studying in Australia. Research suggests that attitudinal factors in high-proficiency students can affect second language (L2) pragmatic production in important ways, students at times rejecting or resisting undesirable L2 pragmatic forms (Cohen, 1997; Hinkel, 1996; LoCastro, 2001; Siegal, 1995, 1996). Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from a group of 20 Korean ESL students studying at language institutes and universities around Melbourne. Findings suggest that there is some avoidance of Australian routines by Korean ESL learners and that this avoidance represents resistance to Australian-English pragmatic norms.",,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00430.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00430.X,ancestry
"J. Hall, A. Cheng, Matthew T. Carlson",2006.0,Reconceptualizing Multicompetence as a Theory of Language Knowledge,"Over the last decade or so, the concept of multicompetence has attracted significant research attention in the field of applied linguistics and in particular in the study of multiple language use and learning. We argue that while research efforts concerned with multicompetence have been useful in advancing a more positive view of second language learners, they have been less successful in transforming understandings of language knowledge. One reason for their lack of success is the fact that these efforts have been mired in a state of theoretical confusion arising from a continued reliance on three assumptions. These assumptions include (1) a view of L1 and L2 language knowledge as distinct systems; (2) the presumption of a qualitative distinction between multicompetence and monocompetence; and (3) the assumption of homogeneity of language knowledge across speakers and contexts. Our intent here is to redress these theoretical inadequacies by making a case for a usage-based view of multicompetence. We do so by drawing on empirical evidence and theoretical insights from other areas concerned with language and language development that expose the theoretical flaws in current research efforts on multicompetence. We then use these new understandings of language to reconsider findings on the language knowledge of multiple language users and to offer new directions for research on multicompetence.",,10.1093/APPLIN/AML013,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/AML013,ancestry

J. Leeman,2003.0,RECASTS AND SECOND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT,"Recasts have figured prominently in recent SLA research, with studies documenting significant advantages for learners exposed to this type of negative feedback. Although some researchers have suggested that such findings imply a beneficial role for negative evidence (i.e., information regarding the impossibility of certain utterances in the language being learned), the source of these benefits has not been explored directly, as multiple variables are conflated in recasts. Specifically, recasts not only offer implicit negative evidence, but they also provide positive evidence. Moreover, recasts are believed to make this positive evidence especially salient. In the present study, 74 learners of L2 Spanish engaged in communicative interaction with the researcher in one of the following conditions: (a) recasts (i.e., negative evidence and enhanced salience of positive evidence), (b) negative evidence, (c) enhanced salience of positive evidence, and (d) unenhanced positive evidence (control). Only the recast and enhanced-salience groups performed significantly better than the control group on posttreatment measures, which suggests that the utility of recasts is derived at least in part from enhanced salience of positive evidence and that the implicit negative evidence they seem to provide may not be a crucial factor.",,10.1017/S0272263103000020,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263103000020,ancestry

"Jacobson, Erik Hugo",2004.0,Community -building in Japanese adult basic education,"By means of an ethnographic multi-case study of three adult basic education programs in Nara prefecture, Japan, this dissertation explores the nature of community building within the adult basic education classroom. It also provides examples of how the sociocultural context of adult basic education in Japan shapes the decisions programs make about the content and nature of adult literacy instruction, the role of assessment in adult basic education, and the nature of teacher preparation. Students in Japanese adult basic education programs are drawn from different minority communities in Japan (burakumin, Koreans, and immigrants) that have a history of being discriminated against, and who remain marginalized by the Japanese mainstream. As a response to both the social and academic needs of adult learners, the adult basic education programs that were part of this study attempt to build a sense of community within the classroom itself. In the process of building this community, students and teachers gave priority to non-academic goals. This created the following expectations: (1)&#xa0;Literacy instruction is to be used for psychological healing and student empowerment, (2)&#xa0;The creation of tight bonds between teachers and students is a goal of the class, rather than just a method, and (3)&#xa0;Classrooms have to be safe spaces for teachers, as well as students, to gather and recuperate. Students and teachers in these programs also rejected the dominant model of Japanese secondary education which prioritizes competition between students and the mastery of a decontextualized curriculum. In keeping with the goals of creating a safe and responsive space, the programs: (1)&#xa0;Utilize an open curriculum, (2)&#xa0;Reject assessment and time limitations put on student tenure, and (3)&#xa0;Problematize the hierarchical student-teacher relationship. In my analysis, I suggest that what informs students' and teachers' decisions is a discourse of empathy which values emotion as a key way of understanding the experiences of others, and views subjectivity as achieved through intersubjective communication. I also suggest that this concern with empathy leads some schools in Japan to provide adult basic education programming that looks very different from what is offered in the United States.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/community-building-japanese-adult-basic-education/docview/305190551/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"James, Brian Gleason",2009.0,Effects of Multimedia Glossary Annotations on Incidental Vocabulary Acquisition in L2 Learners of Japanese,"In recent years, advances in computer technology have allowed increasingly rich multimedia content to be incorporated into educational materials in many fields, including the field of language teaching. Yet as visually appealing as such products may be, we must ask whether multimedia-enriched materials actually improve learning in a measurable way. If so, individual curriculum makers can then decide whether the benefits of the multimedia materials justify the cost of purchasing and implementing them. This study attempted to examine the effects of multimedia glossary aids on incidental vocabulary acquisition rates of L2 learners of Japanese. Subjects included 35 third- and fourth-year students of Japanese at a large private university in the United States, who read a Japanese short story using an online web application that included a multimedia-enriched glossary. A total of 27 keywords were selected from the text for inclusion in the glossary. A third were annotated with English text definitions only; another third had an English text definition plus a picture illustration; the final third had an English text definition plus a video illustration. An unannounced post-test measured vocabulary gains. A logistic mixed models regression was performed to test for differences in acquisition rate across the annotation types. Also, due to the unique dual nature of Japanese orthography, which includes both the phonemic kana and so-called ideographic kanji characters, the regression also examined interaction between orthographic representation of the keyword and annotation type on acquisition rate. A significant result (p&lt;0.0001) was found for annotation type as a main effect, with video-annotated words showing the highest acquisition rates. Additionally, a significant interaction (p=0.0139) was observed between orthography and annotation type, indicating that multimedia glossary annotations may have affected the acquisition of phonemic kana representations of keywords differently than they affected ideographic kanji representations.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-multimedia-glossary-annotations-on/docview/2536779988/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Jenefer Philp,2003.0,CONSTRAINTS ON “NOTICING THE GAP”,"Interaction has been argued to promote noticing of L2 form in a context crucial to learning—when there is a mismatch between the input and the learner's interlanguage (IL) grammar (Gass & Varonis, 1994; Long, 1996; Pica, 1994). This paper investigates the extent to which learners may notice native speakers' reformulations of their IL grammar in the context of dyadic interaction. Thirty-three adult ESL learners worked on oral communication tasks in NS-NNS pairs. During each of the five sessions of dyadic task-based interaction, learners received recasts of their nontargetlike question forms. Accurate immediate recall of recasts was taken as evidence of noticing of recasts by learners. Results indicate that learners noticed over 60–70% of recasts. However, accurate recall was constrained by the level of the learner and by the length and number of changes in the recast. The effect of these variables on noticing is discussed in terms of processing biases. It is suggested that attentional resources and processing biases of the learner may modulate the extent to which learners “notice the gap” between their nontargetlike utterances and recasts.",,10.1017/S0272263103000044,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263103000044,ancestry

It is simply a question of highly conventionalized usage which can be taught quite straightforwardly as 'part of the grammar'. The second area ('sociopragmatic failure') is much more difficult to deal with, since it involves the student's system of beliefs as much as his/her knowledge of the language. I argue that it is essential to avoid prescriptivism in this very sensitive area of language in use.

"Jeon, K Seon;Kim, Hae-young",2007.0,DEVELOPMENT OF RELATIVIZATION IN KOREAN AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE: The Noun Phrase Accessibility Hierarchy in Head-Internal and Head-External Relative Clauses,"This study examines how Keenan and Comrie's (1977) noun phrase accessibility hierarchy (NPAH) intersects with the typological characteristics of Korean in the acquisition of relative clauses (RCs). Korean has two types of RC constructions: head-external and head-internal. The head-external relative has its head to the right of the RC, whereas the head-internal relative has its lexical head in the RC and is marked by the complementizer kes. In first language development, it has been observed the head-internal type emerges earlier than the head-external type. The current study investigates how the use of the two types of RCs interacts with the NPAH, with a focus on subject (SU) and direct object (DO) RCs in Korean second language development. Oral production data were collected from 40 learners of Korean as a foreign language. The results showed that there was an advantage for SU over DO in the head-external RC and that the head-external construction was preceded by headless and head-internal constructions. The results suggest that a head-external RC in Korean involves the syntactic mechanism of linking the head and the gap relation, whereas this might not be the case for a head-internal RC.

"Jimenez Jimenez, Antonio Francisco",2003.0,Linguistic and psychological dimensions of second language attrition during and after a study abroad experience,"After more than two decades of investigation, studies on language attrition have failed to generate findings that enable us to develop a coherent understanding of attrition. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore an innovative way of approaching attrition that links social participation to linguistic production and psychological functioning. To achieve this goal, the study was carried out within a Sociocultural Theoretic framework. In addition, unlike the cross-sectional perspective adopted in most language attrition research, the current study followed a longitudinal design. Ten L2 adult learners of Spanish taking part in a five-month study abroad program participated in the study. The participants were interviewed during their experience in Spain and then again during a seven-month period following their return to the U.S. in order to observe potential development/attrition in the same group of individuals over time. Information was collected on the types and on the amount of time the learners spent engaging in Spanish-mediated activities during and after their experience abroad. Based on this, participants were divided into two groups—participation and non participation—for the purpose of carrying out the relevant linguistic and psychological analyses. Data for the study was elicited in the form of written and oral story narrations which were collected five times throughout the twelve-month period. The texts were analyzed at two levels: linguistic, which focused on specific formal features of the learners' performance; psychological, which analyzed communicative and avoidance strategies as manifestations of students' attempts to maintain and regain self-regulation (i.e., control) over the tasks. The results suggest that degree of participation has an impact on students' level of control over a seemingly invariable linguistic system. That is, students did not experience difficulties with the formal features but they did have significant problems at the psychological level. Given sufficient time to plan, monitor, and focus on the linguistic problems, students were able to resolve linguistic difficulties but, as the analysis shows, over time those who did not maintain contact with Spanish upon returning to the US had considerable problems on the psychological plain with regard to their ability to maintain self-regulation during linguistic performance.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/linguistic-psychological-dimensions-second/docview/304251099/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Johnstone, Richard",2002.0,Research on language teaching and learning: 2001,"As is customary in this annual review, the focus is on research which has been published mainly in international research journals and which has a bearing on the teaching of languages and on those aspects of languages learning and use which seem to have implications for teaching. For the most part, it is additional languages which are under discussion, whether of the second, (third, fourth) or modern foreign or some other variety. 2001 yielded a large number of valuable articles of this sort. Rather than seeking to mention them all, I have made a selection in order to allow certain themes to be developed. Three themes seemed to me to be of particular interest in 2001: 'Focus on form', 'Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and languages' and 'Early language learning'. None of these of course represents a new area of research, but in 2001 they seemed to play strongly. My review begins with a discussion of each of these in turn. In the sections to follow, cross-reference is made to the abstracts in Language Teaching. Thus, Haley (2001: 02-253) refers to the article published in 2001 and appearing as abstract 253 in the 2002 volume of the journal.

Since in each case only a few brief and not fully representative words can be devoted to any one article, a further aim of the review is of course to point readers in the direction of the original articles themselves. As usual, I have broken the review down into a number of key themes, beginning this year with Affective Factors. However, this does not imply that an article deals exclusively with the theme into which I have assigned it. An article appearing in the theme of Acquisition and Learning for example will in many cases have relevance to other themes such as Proficiency, Teaching, Strategies or Curriculum.

"Joo, Hye Ri",2008.0,Agentivity of passives and inchoatives in second language learners of English and Korean,"Second language (L2) learners' overpassivization of unaccusatives such as '*the accident was happened' have been widely investigated. One popular account claims that L2 learners lexically causativize unaccusatives and then syntactically passivize them. This study suggests an alternative possibility: Passive unaccusatives may be caused by learners' confusion in the agentivity of passives and inchoatives. This study therefore explores whether L2 learners know the distinction between passives and inchoatives in terms of agentivity. (a) The window was Broken. (passive) (b) The window broke. (inchoative) Unlike inchoatives, passives imply the agent even if not expressed in the syntax. This dissertation includes two studies: the English as a foreign language (EFL) and the Korean as a foreign language (KFL). Each study includes three experiments: a movie judgment tasks, and two written acceptability judgment tanks—one with sentences and one with question-answer mini-dialogues. The EFL study tested 148 L2 learners of English in Korea and 42 native speakers of English. In the KFL study, the participants were 117 L2 learners of Korean in the U.S. and 64 native speakers of Korean. In the movie test, participants viewed an animation with one of the context types (animate, inanimate, and no agent) and read a passive/inchoative sentence describing the movie and then judge how well the sentence describes the movie. The sentence test investigated how well the participants know that by the agent -phrases (with an animate or inanimate agent) sound natural only with passives, not inchoatives, but that by itself -phrases sound natural with only inchoatives, not passives. The Q&amp;A test examined whether passive and inchoative why -questions expect different types of answers (purpose, animate-cause, and inanimate-cause). The results of the EFL study showed that L2 learners have knowledge of constructional meanings of passives and inchoatives but did not show their knowledge when there was no agent in context given as a stimulus for conceptualization. In the KFL study, L2 learners showed native-like knowledge of the passive and the inchoative in Korean. The results suggests that L2 learners' overpassivization can be caused by their incomplete knowledge of constructional meanings.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/agentivity-passives-inchoatives-second-language/docview/304603261/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Taking Kasper and Schmidt's argument one step further, this article shows how interlanguage itself has been ignored in research on interlanguage pragmatics. Research has not established that pragmatic competence is independent of grammatical competence. Although grammatical competence may not be a sufficient condition for pragmatic development, it may be a necessary condition.

In other words, is there empirical evidence that warrants the development and implementation of a pedagogy of pragmatics in second and foreign language instruction? In this chapter, I will review the empirical evidence that shows that native speakers (NSs) and nonnative speakers (NNSs) of a given target language appear to have different systems of pragmatics, discuss the factors that influence the development of L2 pragmatics systems, and then address the question of whether differences in pragmatics systems warrant instructional treatment.

"Kahn, Gabrielle",2008.0,"The social unfolding of task, discourse, and *development in the second language classroom","Studies on tasks for second language learners have often promoted task types that are highly structured and designed to elicit particular interactional devices. Less explored have been tasks designed with open-ended outcomes, analyzed qualitatively, and implemented in classrooms as opposed to experimental settings. This study examines the language arising from open tasks—tasks designed to unfold by learners and teacher in emergent directions—in a low-level English as a Second Language classroom of adult learners. The central purpose is to discover what dialogic phenomena characterize the discourse arising from open tasks and what relation these phenomena have to second language development. Approximately 20 hours of open task discourse were audiotaped over an eight-week period in both teacher-fronted and small-group interactions. Data were transcribed according to conversation analysis conventions and qualitatively examined through the analytical lens of sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 1978). Three central dialogic phenomena were inductively identified in the open task corpus: (1) emergent form foci, (2) complex negotiation of meaning, and (3) imitation. Dialogic phenomena were analyzed in the open task participation of two different learners as they attended to two different language structures over time—one learner with a syntactic structure (WH-question formation), and the other learner with a discourse structure (narrative formation). The study detailed the participants' negotiation of intersubjectivity in their discourse. Learners were found to expose their thinking and their developmental needs in the open space of their tasks, with their teacher and peers found to reach out with tailored support to build new knowledge and shared activity goals. The findings of this study suggest that: (1) learners' linguistic activity can open a window into their cognitive activity, (2) an open-ended task structure with both teacher and learners participating can set in motion a dynamic interactive process through which the social unfolding of learning can occur, (3) the internalization of new knowledge is a gradual process, and (4) imitative, experimental utterances exhibited during the unbounded tasks of this investigation provide evidence of second language development in process.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/social-unfolding-task-discourse-development/docview/304624443/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Kaku, Keiko",2009.0,Acquisition of telicity in L2: A psycholinguistic study of Japanese learners of English,"This dissertation investigates the acquisition of the semantics of telicity by Japanese learners of English with emphasis on a particular grammatical phenomenon, the neutral perfective reading of simple past predicates (Singh, 1991), which is available in Japanese but not in English. Three main points are of interest in this dissertation: First, we examine whether or not Japanese learners of English learn to derive the telicity of a simple past predicate despite lack of explicit classroom instruction. Second, we investigate potential factors that may assist L2 learners in discovering a target-like representation of the predicate telicity in English. Finally, we aim at revealing the L2 learners' developmental profile for the acquisition of the semantics of telicity. Two experimental tasks, a morphological task and a truth-value judgment task, were conducted which included three proficiency levels of L2 learners (beginner, intermediate and advanced), as well as native speakers of English and Japanese. Empirical data from the experimental tasks indicated that Japanese learners of English succeeded in progressing towards target-like representation of telicity. While the beginners directly transferred the L1 Japanese representation of the semantics of predicate telicity onto their target language, the intermediate and advanced levels dissociated the telicity of the English simple past predicates from that of the Japanese past predicates. That is, they learned to invalidate the neutral perfective reading of English predicates. We postulate that L2 learners' progress in the acquisition of the semantics of English predicate telicity can be accounted for by the acquisition of Det/Num morphology and by a Bayesian learning model: This learning model helps learners use L2 input to make form-meaning inferences on the predicate telicity and aids them to gradually acquire the most appropriate representation of English predicate telicity.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-telicity-l2-psycholinguistic-study/docview/89184127/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Kaneko, Emiko",2008.0,An analysis of oral performance by Japanese learners of English,"This research seeks to achieve two goals: (1) to illuminate the developmental course of speaking proficiency in Japanese learners of English and (2) to disclose the influence of elicitation tasks on oral performance. The data, which were excerpted from a large-scale learner spoken corpus, were objectively analyzed in terms of accuracy, fluency and complexity. One of the unique features of the present study is that the speech samples were divided into six proficiency levels (five intermediate levels and one advanced level). The reliability of this detailed classification of proficiency levels based on holistic evaluation is first established. Then, the utterances of learners at various proficiency levels are compared in an effort to identify the chief characteristics of spoken English for each level. The second goal, the analysis of task influence, involves an investigation of the interaction between proficiency level and task complexity, i.e., how learners of different proficiencies respond differentially to pedagogic tasks depending on the cognitive demands of the tasks. For this purpose, oral performances elicited by a (dynamic) narrative and a (static) picture description task are compared. The results show that learners first become able to create longer sentences and only then become more fluent. Accuracy improves at a later stage still, and syntactic complexity (i.e., the degree of subordination) evolves progressively from the Intermediate Low to Intermediate High levels. An interaction between task and proficiency level also exists: the more demanding task elicits longer and more syntactically complex sentences from higher level learners but has no effect on lower level learners. The choice of subordinate finite clauses is also influenced by the nature of the task. This set of investigations further indicates that learners temporarily go through a phase in which they create utterances that seem deviant from the predicted course of development and which defy a particular typological universal. These seem to be strategies utilized by learners to lighten the cognitive load of spontaneous speech when under the stress of second language communicative pressure. The results reported in this dissertation can be expected to have implications for foreign language pedagogy as well as for the testing of speaking proficiency.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/analysis-oral-performance-japanese-learners/docview/304486925/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kang, Hyun-Sook",2007.0,"Negative evidence: Its positioning, explicitness and linguistic focus as factors in second language acquisition","This study investigated the role of negative evidence and its explicitness and positioning factors in second language acquisition. The explicitness factor was divided into explicit vs. implicit in light of the presence or absence of deductive, metalinguistic rule instruction during conversational interaction. The positioning factor was categorized into proactive vs. reactive. While the proactive condition provided negative evidence prior to the learner production of errors on the basis of the perceived gap in the interlanguage, the reactive condition presented negative evidence contingent on learners' erroneous utterances. Forty-five heritage learners of Korean at the post-secondary level participated in the study. The design of pretest - immediate posttest - delayed posttest composed of the grammaticality judgment test and oral picture description test was utilized, along with three experimental conditions and a control condition. One week after the administration of the pretest, the learners engaged in one of the following conditions: (1)&#xa0;explicit/proactive; (2)&#xa0;explicit/reactive; (3)&#xa0;implicit/reactive; and (4)&#xa0;provision of backchannels (control). During the instructional session, the learners were provided with the different types of negative evidence on the Korean past tense form. The posttest was conducted immediately following the instructional session and the delayed posttest took place four weeks after the instruction and posttest session. Analyses of the pretest and immediate posttest results showed that the three experimental groups outperformed the control group, which supports for the facilitative role of negative evidence in improving the knowledge of the Korean past tense form. It was revealed that the reactive provision of negative evidence was more effective than the proactive provision, which suggests that negative evidence immediately contingent on the learners' deviant form was successful in facilitating the learner knowledge of the target form. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the explicit vs. implicit negative evidence in facilitating the learners' knowledge of the target form, which supported for the potential of implicit provision of negative evidence without interrupting the flow of conversation. Theoretical and pedagogical implications of this empirical research, along with directions for future research, were addressed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/negative-evidence-positioning-explicitness/docview/304837800/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kanno, Kazue",2007.0,FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROCESSING OF JAPANESE RELATIVE CLAUSES BY L2 LEARNERS,"This article reports on a crosslinguistic comparative study of the processing of Japanese relative clauses (RCs) by Chinese-, Sinhalese-, Vietnamese-, Thai-, and Indonesian-speaking second language (L2) learners. A robust finding in studies on the acquisition of RCs in L2 English and other European languages is that subject-gap RCs are easier than object-gap RCs, both in production and comprehension. However, in the case of L2 Japanese studies, the picture does not seem to be as clear as in the English case. This study identifies some factors that might contribute to this situation. The results of a listening comprehension test involving reversible and nonreversible test sentences show that the five groups of learners overall found subject-gap RCs easier to process than object-gap RCs, but that their performances are poor and vary for sentence types in which no semantic cue is available to help identify the grammatical function of the overt noun phrase in RCs, yielding inconclusive results with respect to the question of whether subject-gap RCs are easier than object-gap RCs. Results indicate that when RCs are too difficult for learners to process, first language properties such as head direction, word order, and the relative order of filler and gap affect the manner in which they are interpreted.

"Karacaer, Zehra",2003.0,The Role of Processing Instruction : a Study on English Causatives,"This study attempts to examine possible effects of two types of instruction: processing (PI) and traditional (TI) in learning of English causatives by Turkish learners and to see whether possible positive effects are retained well over time by PI and Tl groups. For this study, seven classes of 120 Turkish students at the School of Foreign Languages at Anadolu University, Eskişehir, Turkey were randomly assigned to three groups: (a) processing instruction, (b) traditional instruction, and (c) no instruction. Two different instructional packets and a pretest and a post / follow-up test were administered. The tests consisted of two taskg: interpretation and production. The pretest was given two weeks before the treatment. The procedure regarding the treatment and the posttest spanned two 50-minute class periods. Five weeks later, the posttest was given as the follow-up test. Raw scores from the pretest, posttest, and follow-up test were submitted to a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results were shown in tables and figures. The results of the analysis of the interpretation data indicated that both the PI and TI groups resulted in some kind of knowledge gain due to the treatments. Both the PI and TI groups had a positive effect on how learners interpreted the English causatives. The effects both the PI and TI groups were retamed over time. The results of the analysis of the production data indicated that both the PI and TI groups resulted in some kind of knowledge gain due to the treatments. Both the PI and TI groups had a positive effect on how learners produced the English causatives. However, both the PI and TI groups fai1ed to show the same performance in the follow- up test, but the drop in the TI group' s scores was greater than the drop in the PI's scores.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-processing-instruction-study-on-english/docview/2604011086/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Katayama, Akiko",2008.0,Borderland discourses of first -year junior college English majors in Japan: A situated qualitative study,"English education in Japan has long been a site of ideological struggle. Although much concern has been expressed about the effectiveness of English education in the nation's school system, few studies have examined what actually happens in a university English classroom over an extended period of time. Furthermore, voices of Japanese EFL students have rarely been investigated in their social context. In this dissertation, I report on a longitudinal situated qualitative study of 27 first-year students who studied in an EFL program at a women's junior college. The study is guided by the theory of language socialization (Schieffelin &amp; Ochs, 1986) and Gee's concept of ""Discourses with a capital D"" (Gee, 1992, 1996, 2005). The methods included observations and videotaping of 30 sessions of an English discussion course over the course of the 2002 academic year. I also performed 27 taped group and individual interviews with the students and their native-speaker teacher. Social conditions including the bleak job market and the falling population of 18 year-olds have compelled most colleges and universities in Japan to revise their curricula, particularly their foreign language programs. Under such pressure, the junior college under investigation was tying to implement a theme-based English program that focused on social issues and English education. As a result, the English program became a contact zone (Pratt, 1991) of conflicting ideological social practices, or Discourses. The present study depicts how the first-year junior college English majors formed peer-based Discourses in the discussion course. The students developed their own tacit rules of how to look and sound like legitimate members, and the rules also implicitly regulated who would speak Japanese or English in class, when, how, and to whom. The study examined three specific make-do strategies: (1)&#xa0;A constant and strategic use of Japanese, (2)&#xa0;a Japanized accent when speaking English, and (3)&#xa0;calling the native-speaker teacher by his last name without any honorific in class. The peer-based borderland Discourses allowed the students to rewrite a demanding and pedagogically inconsistent English education program on their own terms, and to make it more meaningful for the realities of their immediate future.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/borderland-discourses-first-year-junior-college/docview/304471706/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kawahara, Shigeto",2007.0,The emergence of phonetic naturalness,"This dissertation addresses whether synchronic phonology encodes phonetic naturalness. I argue that while phonological grammars allow phonetically unnatural patterns as a result of coincidental historical changes, they are nevertheless biased toward phonetic naturalness. The key observation revealed by experimentation is that phonetic naturalness emerges when speakers create novel phonological patterns. I refer to the observation as ""the emergence of phonetic naturalness"". To explain the emergence of phonetic naturalness, I propose within Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 2004) that the universal set of constraints is phonetically natural, and constraint rankings are also phonetically natural by default. To accommodate unnaturalness, individual languages can create unnatural constraints and reverse default constraint rankings. Chapter 1 lays out the issues and Chapter 2 develops a grammatical model. Chapter 3 discusses devoicing of voiced geminates in Japanese loanword phonology. Only voiced geminates, but not voiced singletons, can devoice to dissimilate from another voiced obstruent. I argue that the difference in neutralizability is grounded in a perceptibility scale related to the voicing contrast in singletons and geminates, but that the cause of devoicing, OCP(voice), is phonetically unnatural. Chapter 4 discusses a novel pattern of Japanese mimetic gemination. When speakers create emphatic forms, they prefer geminate stops the most, geminate fricatives next, and geminate nasals least. The preference hierarchy harmonically aligns with the perceptibility scale for singleton-geminate contrasts for different manners of consonants. Chapter 5 examines the distribution of vowels that are correspond with Ø in novel Japanese rap rhyming. The likelihood of vowels being treated as Ø directly correlates with their perceptual similarity to Ø. Chapter 6 shows that in rap rhyming the more perceptually similar two consonants are, the more likely they are to rhyme. The patterns studied in Chapter 5 and 6 show that phonetically natural patterns emergence in novel verbal art. The case studies suggest that when speakers create novel phonological patterns, they deploy phonetic knowledge, and hence phonetically natural patterns assert themselves.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/emergence-phonetic-naturalness/docview/304837884/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kawate-Mierzejewska, Megumi",2002.0,Refusal sequences in conversational discourse,"This study investigated sequences of refusal realization strategies between Japanese speakers speaking Japanese (JJs) and North American English speaker speaking Japanese (AJs) in conversational discourse focusing on the differences and similarities between native speakers (NSs) and nonnative speakers (NNSs) as well as those between males and females. I also investigated to what extent and in what way different initiation types affected the differences and similarities of refusal sequences in conversational discourse between the JJs and AJs. Ten male JJs, ten female JJs, ten male AJs, and ten female AJs participated in this study in addition to coders and a requester. Forty separate telephone conversations with two different groups of participants were taped, one with JJ-JJ interactions, and the other with JJ-AJ interactions. In analyzing the recorded data, each interaction was first transcribed, and then each transcribed conversation was divided into stages on the basis of the requester's initiation. Then request-refusal interactions were carefully examined and the requester's initiations were coded. This was followed by the coding of refusal realization strategies used at each stage. Finally, semantic formulas used for first and final responses in refusal sequences, patterns of relationship between the first and final responses, patterns of request-refusal interactions, and patterns of refusal sequences were identified and examined. The results indicate that (a)&#xa0;the AJs used a wider variety of refusal realization strategies in their first responses to a request than did the JJs; (b)&#xa0;the JJs and AJs all used different varieties of refusal realization strategies in their final responses which made the requester stop negotiating; (c)&#xa0;the AJs employed twice as many patterns as did the JJs in the relationship between the first and final responses of refusal sequential organizations; (d)&#xa0;refusal sequential organizations were independent of different types of re-initiations; (e)&#xa0;the AJs employed a wider variety of refusal sequential organizations than did the JJs in conversational discourse; and (f)&#xa0;responses by males were often different from those of females regardless of first language in their entire sequences of refusal realization strategies. To conclude, the study has raised many important issues in investigating refusal interactions.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/refusal-sequences-conversational-discourse/docview/275872042/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kayama, Yuhko",2006.0,Second language acquisition of Japanese relative clauses,"This thesis investigates the second language acquisition of Japanese relative clauses (RCs) by native speakers of English or Korean. Researchers have argued that Universal Grammar (UG) can be accessed in adult second language (L2) acquisition. The Full Transfer Full Access (FTFA) Hypothesis (Schwartz and Sprouse 1994, 1996) claims that after initial transfer from L1, learners reset their parameter values and are able to acquire L2 properties that are different from their L1. Japanese and English relativization: while Japanese relativization does not involve movement in the syntax (Kuno 1973, Saito 1985, etc.), English relativization involves obligatory operator movement and is subject to movement constraints like Subjacency. Because of Subjacency, certain RC structures are prohibited in English. In Japanese, on the other hand, a zero pronominal, pro , is base-generated in the gap position of an RC and coindexed with the relative head noun, and thus long distance relativization is possible. I argue that the presence or absence of pro is also a parametric difference between Japanese and English; pro is present in Japanese, but not in English. In order for English speakers to acquire Japanese RCs, they need to reset the values of these two parameters. Experimental studies were conducted with high-intermediate and advanced learners of Japanese (15 English speakers and 18 Korean speakers). Tests examined the learners' knowledge of the two grammatical properties in Japanese---namely, the lack of wh-movement and the presence of pro . Korean is different from English but similar to Japanese with respect to the parameters in question. Following FTFA, it is hypothesized that English-speaking learners initially transfer their L1 values, and that eventually they are able to switch parameters to the L2 values by accessing UG. The results of several tasks (including interpretation tasks and judgment tasks) confirm this hypothesis; while Korean speakers generally performed well irrespective of proficiency levels, English-speaking intermediate learners transferred their L1 values, failing to accept grammatical Japanese sentences that are not possible in English. English-speaking advanced learners, on the other hand, performed better than intermediate learners, and exhibited evidence that they had acquired the two properties of Japanese, supporting FTFA.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-japanese-relative/docview/304931766/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

The literature on these speech acts – along with that on requests and apologies – is among the richest in crosscultural and interlanguage pragmatics, offering coverage of both pragmalinguistics and sociopragmatics. Compliments and compliment responses were also among the first speech acts to be targeted for empirically informed teaching of pragmatics (Holmes & Brown, 1987), as well as for the study of the effects of instruction in interlanguage pragmatics (Billmyer, 1990a, 1990b). The current study incorporates aspects of each of these lines of inquiry, but adds several elements, namely, the two instructional approaches and the foreign language context. Background We will not provide a detailed survey of the literature on the effects of instruction in pragmatics, or on issues such as explicit and implicit learning, both of which receive comprehensive coverage in Bardovi- Harlig (this volume) and Kasper (this volume).

"Kim, Duk-Young",2001.0,A descriptive analysis of Korean and English apologies with implications for interlanguage pragmatics,"The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate Korean baseline data on apologies as well as interlanguage apologies of Koreans in the EFL (English as a Foreign Language) environment. In particular, Korean and EFL speakers' apology behaviors are analyzed in terms of different social variables with particular attention to pragmatic transfer of first language norms. In general, many Korean EFL speakers mistakenly transfer their apology strategies to English, believing that these strategies are the same for both languages. Therefore, this study compares the findings of both Korean and interlanguage apologies in light of transfer phenomena. A variety of data collection methods were used: role-playing, ethnographic observation and the scripts of Korean TV dramas. The Korean EFL participants are comprised of 60 undergraduate students who are majoring in English at a university in Korea. The research questions of this dissertation are as follows: (1)&#xa0;How, and to what extent, do Korean students of English transfer their first language norms of apologizing when using English as a foreign language? (2)&#xa0;How, and to what extent, do the social factors (gender, age, social status and social distance) affect the choices of Koreans when speaking English? (3)&#xa0;How do apology strategies differ between what is appropriate in Korean L1 and English as a foreign language? (4)&#xa0;How do Korean speakers perform and react to the speech act of apology according to the influence of social factors in spontaneous situations? The findings of this study showed the influence of social factors: social distance, social status, age, gender and severity of offense. In regards to the “social status” factor, EFL speakers transferred their L1 pragmatic norms into English when using the “alerter” strategy. With respect to the “age” factor, EFL speakers in the Equal-age group showed the transfer phenomenon from their native pragmatic norms to English. Finally, concerning the “gender” factor, EFL speakers in the male-female group also transferred L1 pragmatic norms by using a higher proportion of the “repetition” strategy than with the remaining groups. This study has important pedagogical implications for non-native speakers receiving overt instruction on speech acts in English as a foreign language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/descriptive-analysis-korean-english-apologies/docview/304693080/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kim, Hana",2007.0,The interpretation of English pronouns by native speakers of Korean,"This thesis investigated how Korean L2 speakers of English, whose L1 is a null argument language, interpret English pronouns, and how (or if) their L1 plays a role in the interpretation of English pronouns. Specifically, it examined whether Korean speakers of English have knowledge of Binding Principle B in the interpretation of English pronouns, and also whether they transfer their preferences for a discourse antecedent versus a matrix subject (sentence internal) antecedent from their L1 to English. As a pretest, the participants' knowledge in relation to subject and object omission in English was examined. The results showed that the Korean speakers of English, regardless of whether or not they knew that English is not a null argument language, knew that an English pronoun cannot be locally bound in its governing category. That is, the results indicated that their interpretation of pronouns in their English L2 was constrained by Binding Principle B. Furthermore, the results showed that they preferred a matrix subject antecedent to a discourse antecedent, similar to the native speakers of English. However, at the same time, they were more inclined to accept a discourse antecedent than were the native speakers of English. The results suggested that the Korean speakers of English were influenced to a certain extent by their L1 in their interpretation of English pronouns, while their L1 Korean did not cause problems to figure out non-local constraints for an English pronoun.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interpretation-english-pronouns-native-speakers/docview/304828760/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Kim, Hee Kyoung",2007.0,The role of the learner subjectivity and pragmatic transfer in the performance of requests by Korean ESL learners,"Based on a cross-cultural comparison of requesting behavior between Koreans and Americans, the study tried to determine the extent of pragmatic transfer and the impact of individual subjective motives that may influence pragmatic language choice. Two different groups of subjects participated in this study: 30 Korean participants for Korean (KK) and also for interlanguage (KE) data who were studying English as a Second Language (ESL) in a U.S. university, and 30 American college students (AE). Data were collected by using a questionnaire with a Discourse Completion Task (DCT). Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with 13 Korean ESL learners who showed the highest and the least amount of pragmatic transfer. Findings showed evidence of pragmatic transfer in the request responses given by Korean ESL learners in the level of directness, perspectives of head acts, and the frequency of supportive moves and internal modifiers. The requesting behaviors of KE group were realized through more direct strategies than those of AE group. KE speakers had a tendency to use hearer-oriented requests more frequently than AE speakers, but slightly less than KK speakers, indicating that L1 transfer is operative. Pragmatic transfer occurred in three supportive moves such as Promise of Reward, Appreciation, and Apology and in three internal modifiers such as play-down, consultative device, and downtoner. The interviewees in this study were conscious of differing rules for requesting. Learners’ judgment of L2 pragmatic norms, the learners’ perception of their own language and their attitudes of the learned language have a determining influence on language use. Furthermore, findings showed that purpose of learning the L2, learners’ different types of motivation, and the length of residence intention contribute to the extent of pragmatic transfer. Finally, impossibility to acquire native-like proficiency, fear of disloyalty to their own culture, and preference of L1 styles as a marker of cultural identity seemed to be factors that influence learners’ pragmatic choices. Findings of this study offer implications that language educators need to recognize and plan for the different target goals language learners may have and that second/foreign language speakers also possess a desire to express their own identity.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-learner-subjectivity-pragmatic-transfer/docview/304728982/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Kim, Jong-Won",2007.0,A comparative study of the effects of explicit-inductive/cooperative instruction versus explicit-deductive/individualistic instruction on the second language acquisition of English relative clauses in Korean university-level EFL learners,"The problem . The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there would be a significant difference between an explicit-inductive/cooperative instruction and an explicit-deductive/individualistic instruction for the acquisition of English relative clauses in Korean university-level EFL learners. Method . This study used a mixed method design of data collection and analysis. The subject pool consisted of 90 undergraduate EFL students at Cheongju University, Korea. Two intact classes of 45 students each were randomly assigned to one of the treatments. Both groups received instruction about English relative clauses using the explicit-inductive/cooperative approach (experimental group), or the explicit-deductive/individualistic approach (control group). Students were administered a pretest, a posttest, and a delayed posttest with two sections: a Sentence Combining Test (SCT) and a Grammaticality Judgment Test (GJT). T-tests of dependent and independent samples were carried out to test for significant within groups and across group differences. To provide more reliability and validity for the results of quantitative data analysis, the results of the qualitative data analysis were triangulated with the quantitative results. Results . Both groups significantly increased their overall learning outcomes from the pretest to the posttest, but the experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group. Therefore, the explicit-inductive/cooperative instruction was more effective than the explicit-deductive/individualistic instruction. Also, both groups consistently scored higher on the SCT than on the GJT, but the experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group on both the SCT and the GJT. The rank order of mastery over four types of English relative clauses was OS &gt; OO &gt; SS &gt; SO, and the rank order of mastery over four types of common errors of English relative clauses was pronoun retention &gt; incorrect relative-marker morphology &gt; inappropriate relative-marker omission &gt; nonadjacency. EFL learners reported that they preferred cooperative learning over the explicit-inductive, discovery grammar activities. However, both the explicit-inductive, discovery grammar activities and cooperative learning were positively rated. Six key themes were found regarding EFL learners' perceptions of explicit-inductive, discovery grammar activities: (1)&#xa0;learner-centeredness; (2)&#xa0;complete understanding of the concepts; (3)&#xa0;positive attitudes towards L2 grammar learning; (4)&#xa0;creative thinking; (5)&#xa0;neutrality toward the explicit-inductive, discovery grammar activities; and (6)&#xa0;preference for the traditional explicit-deductive grammar activities. Seven key themes were found regarding their perceptions of cooperative learning: (1)&#xa0;Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) through more communication and interaction; (2)&#xa0;interdependence through more opportunities to answer questions; (3)&#xa0;more comfortable, safer, and less competitive learning environment; (4)&#xa0;active and independent learners; (5)&#xa0;learner-centeredness, (6)&#xa0;neutrality toward cooperative learning; and (7)&#xa0;preference for individualistic learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comparative-study-effects-explicit-inductive/docview/304701905/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Kono, Nariyo",2001.0,Language orientations: Case study of a Japanese -as -a -foreign -language classroom,"The purpose of this study is to examine the theories of orientations in the context of a Japanese-as-a-foreign-language (JFL) classroom in the Northwest of the United States. Using a Grounded Theory methodology, this study includes data from card-sorting activities, teacher and student interviews, classroom observations, and scenario studies. The perspectives of language planning—theories of orientations—bring socio-political aspects to the foreign language classroom context, and help to describe the participants’ voices, hopes and determinations toward learning Japanese in a foreign language classroom setting. The existing theories of orientations and the abstraction of the data results are merged into a new taxonomy. The notion of Grounded Theory—an interplay of data and theories—is a central perspective throughout the study. The JFL program in the Northwest reflects many aspects of the language-as-resource orientation. Most of the participants’ voices and hopes are explicitly included in the program and in some standards on foreign language education. However, heritage language and identity issues are not explicitly discussed in this program. The research suggests that this program consider this aspect and develop an appropriate methodology for this population. In addition, a new descriptive orientation taxonomy is suggested in the coding process: Language as means of communication, Language as linguistic means, and Language as a mediator of culture (with two different emphases: First language and culture; and Any language and culture). The research findings and interpretations were negotiated with the participants in order to assure their appropriateness, and the study includes two-year data from various interviews, ranging from a pilot study to final interviews. Final interviews were conducted in addition to the main study in order to assure the results and my interpretations of interview quotations. This study contributes to research methodology itself by incorporating various research tools including descriptive statistics and traditional qualitative methods. As an exploration of this topic, this study presents important implications to foreign language education and pedagogy, and to theory development in language planning and policy.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/language-orientations-case-study-japanese-as/docview/304684263/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Kristine Billmyer, Manka M. Varghese",2000.0,Investigating instrument-based pragmatic variability: effects of enhancing discourse completion tests,"A significant dilemma in sociolinguistic research concerns the methods used to collect data, the validity of different types of data and, '…their adequacy to approximate the authentic performance of linguistic action' (Kasper and Dahl 1991: 215). Manes and Wolfson (1981) claimed that the most authentic data in sociolinguistic research is spontaneous speech gathered by ethnographic observation. Difficulties in relying on this method are well-documented (Blum-Kulka et al. 1989, Aston 1995) and have led to the wide use of an elicitation procedure known as the discourse completion test (DCT). Justified criticisms have been levelled at the DCT, some labelling it an instrument that limits the capturing of authentic communication, and others making it look almost obsolete. However, there are to date no other sociolinguistic data collection instruments that have as many administrative advantages as the DCT, making it, practically speaking, a resource pragmatics testing and teaching will continue to rely on. Furthermore, a better understanding of communication in such a constructed context may help us gain a better understanding of authentic communication. This study investigates the effect of systematic modification to DCT situational prompts used to elicit requests on the responses of native and non-native speakers of English. Modification included enhancing the situational prompts by adding information on a number of social and contextual variables considered relevant to this study. Results indicate that enhancement did not affect the request strategy or amount of internal modification. However, enhancing situational prompts did produce significantly longer, more elaborated requests in both groups. These findings point to the importance of external modification of speech act production and the need for an instrument that can satisfactorily account for both variation and context. This study has implications for both teaching and testing in interlanguage pragmatics.",,10.1093/APPLIN/21.4.517,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/21.4.517,ancestry

"Kumagai, Yuri",2004.0,(De)mystifying literacy practices in a foreign language classroom: A critical discourse analysis,"This study problematizes the literacy practices of a second-year, Japanese language classroom at a small women's college. Drawing on critical perspectives on language, literacy and d/Discourse (Gee, 1990)—in particular, on sociocultural and poststructural theories—this study discusses the joint actions of a classroom teacher and her students. Using Fairclough's (1992b) model of critical discourse analysis as an analytical tool combined with the methodology of critical ethnography, this study closely examines classroom interactions through moment-by-moment analysis of numerous literacy events. Through year-long ethnographic fieldwork and two subsequent years of dialogue with the teacher, I chose to focus my study on “moments of tension.” I selected five “critical moments” when diversions from the teacher's lesson agenda were observed during the classroom literacy events. The dynamic interplay among the texts, the students' identities and the teacher's discourses inspired those critical moments. They were moments when both the teacher and the students struggled to defend what they believed as true and attempted to inhabit ideal subject positions against textual representations. My use of critical discourse analysis revealed that, in general, the students drew from the dominant discourses that the teacher had provided so that they could successfully participate and make sense of the literacy events. However, when the texts represented a reality or truth that challenged the students' beliefs about their identity and/or ontology, the students resisted such representations and “disrupted” the dominant classroom discourse by drawing on counter-discourses. Similarly, when the students' counter-discourses challenged the teacher's ontology and/or identity, she resisted taking up those discourses and tried to normalize the moments by deflecting the issues at hand and by withdrawing from the “intersection of the discourses” rather than opting to facilitate a dialogue about competing discourses. This study argues that these moments of tension displayed how students contributed significantly to the production of knowledge in the classroom. They point out how students exercise their agency and take up positions as “knowers” that align with their sense of self.

"Lantolf, James P",2006.0,SOCIOCULTURAL THEORY AND L2: State of the Art,"This article considers the implications of two central constructs of sociocultural theory (SCT) for second language (L2) development: mediation and internalization. It first discusses Vygotsky's general theoretical claim that human mental activity arises as a consequence of the functional system formed by our biologically specified mental capacities and our culturally constructed symbolic artifacts. It then examines some of the L2 research that has investigated the extent to which L2 users are able to deploy their new language for cognitive mediation. Specific attention is given to the mediational function of L2 private speech and to the synchronization of gestures and speech from the perspective of Slobin's thinking for speaking framework, a framework that interfaces quite well with Vygotsky's theory. The second general topic addressed, internalization, is intimately connected to the first. It is argued that internalization of the features of a L2 takes place through imitation, especially as occurs in private speech. Imitation, based on recent neuroscience and child development research, is seen as an intentional and potentially transformative process rather than as rote mimicking. The research documents that L2 children and adults rely on imitation in their private speech when they encounter new linguistic affordances. What remains to be established is the connection between the linguistic features of private speech and those deployed by L2 speakers in their social performance. Finally, the article proposes that the study of how L2 learners internalize and develop the capacity to use conceptual and associated linguistic knowledge should move to the forefront of SCT L2 research and argues that a productive way of realizing this agenda is through the union of SCT and cognitive linguistics.

"Laura Collins, P. Trofimovich, Joanna L White, W. Cardoso, Marlise Horst",2009.0,Some Input on the Easy/Difficult Grammar Question: An Empirical Study,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether it is possible to distinguish between “difficult” and “easy” constructions for second language (L2) learners by examining characteristics of the structures as they occur in aural input. In a multidimensional analysis of 3 English structures with different acquisition profiles—the simple past, possessive determiners his/her, and the progressive aspect—we examined the phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexicosemantic characteristics of the forms as they occurred in a 110,000-word corpus of instructional talk to L2 learners. We analyzed the type/token distributions of the forms, their lexical properties, and their perceptual salience. Our findings revealed key input factors that distinguished between the early-acquired progressive, on the one hand, and the later-acquired past and his/her determiners, on the other hand. These results lend support to theoretical accounts of the input–acquisition relationship and also generate hypotheses for manipulating instructional input to increase the salience of opaque constructions.

"Lee, Sang-Ki",2008.0,"Salience, frequency, and aptitude in the learning of unaccusativity in a second language: An input enhancement study","Working from the perspective of usage-based accounts of language learning (e.g., Ellis, 2008; Robinson &amp; Ellis, 2008), this dissertation examined the instructional benefits of input enhancement on the processing of the unaccusative construction in English by Korean high school students. The processing of form for learning by second language (L2) learners was expected to be affected by the roles of: types of input salience (enhancement versus flood), types of input frequency distribution (skewed versus balanced), and two aptitudinal factors (language-analytic ability and working memory capacity). One hundred fifty-four participants, randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups and two control groups, were presented with five versions of an L2 reading passage. Each experimental text contained six unaccusative verbs selected based on their corpus frequencies. Instances of the six verbs were visually highlighted in the enhancement condition, whereas they were presented in a plain text format in the flood condition. In the skewed distribution condition, happen was predominantly presented as a prototypical member. By contrast, each verb appeared twice in the balanced distribution condition. Overall token frequency of the verbs was equal in all four experimental conditions. In the fifth, control condition, the text contained no unaccusatives but delivered the same content as the experimental texts. Three equivalent, counterbalanced sections of a scaled grammaticality judgment task were administered to measure the extent of change in the students' knowledge of unaccusatives immediately as well as three weeks after the treatments. Results indicated that the participants immediately benefited from the reading materials containing the salient and frequent input instances. However, statistically significant mean differences among the three levels of the salience factor existed only between the enhancement and the control. Likewise, statistically significant mean differences among the three levels of the distribution factor existed only between the balanced distribution and the control. The treatment effects, though not generalizable, were somewhat durable with some deterioration over three weeks. While the two aptitude measures appeared to measure a distinct component of the construct well, only the analytical performances correlated weakly with the delayed judgment scores. Implications for theory and pedagogy are discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/salience-frequency-aptitude-learning/docview/304604576/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Leeman, Jennifer",2000.0,"Towards a new classification of input: An empirical study of the effect of recasts, negative evidence, and enhanced salience on L2 development","Two interrelated problems which are of crucial importance in second language acquisition theory and research are: (a)&#xa0;determining which types of linguistic input are utilized in the language acquisition process, and (b)&#xa0;investigating the ways in which participation in communicative interaction can promote language development. Recasts (i.e., targetlike reformulations of nontargetlike utterances) have figured prominently in both lines of research, with recent studies documenting significant advantages for learners exposed to this feedback type. While some researchers have maintained that such findings suggest a role for negative evidence (i.e., information regarding the impossibility of certain utterances in the language being learned), this important issue has not been explored directly, as multiple variables are conflated in recasts. Specifically, recasts not only offer implicit negative evidence, but they also provide positive evidence. Moreover, recasts constitute a discourse structure which may enhance the salience of this positive evidence. To date, there is no empirical evidence regarding how recasts promote language development, nor regarding the isolated effects of negative evidence and enhanced salience of positive evidence in oral input. In order to promote the design of studies which isolate independent features of feedback and input types, this dissertation argues for a new input classification scheme, one in which positive and negative evidence are considered as independent, rather than mutually exclusive, categories. The proposed classification, which includes multiple theoretically-motivated features used to further describe input, is then used in the design of an empirical study in which negative evidence and enhanced salience of positive evidence are isolated. Seventy-three learners of L2 Spanish engaged in individual communicative interaction with the researcher in one of the following conditions: (a)&#xa0;recasts (i.e., negative evidence and enhanced salience of positive evidence), (b)&#xa0;negative evidence, (c)&#xa0;enhanced salience of positive evidence, (d)&#xa0;unenhanced positive evidence (control). The fact that only the recast and enhanced salience groups performed significantly better than the control group on the posttest and delayed posttest suggests that the utility of recasts derives at least in part from enhanced salience of positive evidence, and that the implicit negative evidence they provide is not a crucial factor.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/towards-new-classification-input-empirical-study/docview/304590084/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Leila Ranta, R. Lyster",2007.0,Practice in a Second Language: A cognitive approach to improving immersion students' oral language abilities: The Awareness-Practice-Feedback sequence,"Consider the experiences of a grade-12 student who has studied French for a total of 13 years in Alberta, the first few years of which were in a total immersion program where all instruction was in French. She travels to Montreal for the first time. To her great shock, she finds that she is unable to use her French very much because the bilingual speakers she comes into contact with switch to English the minute they hear her speak. She comments, “I quickly realized … that my French is not the same as Quebecois French” (Haynes, 2001). This experience of communicative failure in the second language (L2) puts a human face on the research findings that characterize the oral production of French immersion students as being “non-nativelike.” Immersion researchers have studied the effectiveness of different types of pedagogical interventions designed to overcome the limitations of immersion instruction. These interventions have included enriching the input learners are exposed to (Harley, 1989b), drawing learners' attention to non-salient features of the L2 (Lyster, 1994), increasing the amount of student output (Kowal & Swain, 1997), and providing unambiguous feedback on learners' non-targetlike utterances (Lyster, 2004). This chapter examines the issue of the non-nativelike quality of immersion students' L2 production from the perspective of the language practice that occurs in early immersion classrooms. In this discussion, we highlight the value of using cognitive skill-learning theory (Anderson, 1983) as a framework for sequencing instructional activities aimed at improving the formal accuracy of the otherwise fluent speech of immersion students.",,10.1017/CBO9780511667275.009,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511667275.009,ancestry
"Li, Yan",2008.0,"The negation -numerical NP interaction in non -native Chinese: UG, POS problem, and syntactic analyses","This dissertation is an investigation of the possible influence of native language English (L1), and universal grammar (UG) on the acquisition of a non-native language Chinese (L2), through an examination of how English-speaking L2 Chinese learners acquire the knowledge of the interpretation of Chinese sentences containing negation (Neg) and numerically quantified noun phrases (QNP) in object position. Two research questions are investigated: (1) Can English-speaking L2 Chinese learners overcome the Poverty-of-the-Stimulus problem and produce native-like interpretation of L2 sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position? (2) If English-speaking L2 Chinese learners do overcome the POS problem, what factors in the L2 can help them to reset the parameters? Two experiments were carried out to answer these research questions. Experiment 1 employed the methodology of Truth Value Judgment Task to test English-speaking L2 Chinese learners' interpretation of sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position. The results suggest that L1 transfer occurred in the initial state of acquisition, but the POS problem can be overcome due to the accessibility of UG to L2 learners. Experiment 2 tests predications made by syntactic analyses on second language acquisition to see whether the acquisition of the interpretation of sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position is related to the acquisition of other aspects of the Chinese language. The test results indicated that the acquisition of the correct placement of adjuncts is not the trigger helping L2 learners successfully acquire the knowledge to interpret sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position. The knowledge that Chinese numerical NPs are not free to take subject position might be regulated under the same parameters as the acquisition of the interpretation of sentences containing negation and a numerical NP in object position. It is concluded that both the L1 and UG may inform L2 acquisition of phenomena at the syntax-semantics interpretive interface.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/negation-numerical-np-interaction-non-native/docview/304488135/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Liao, Chu Hsiu",2005.0,First language use in EFL (English as a foreign language) writing processes,"The purpose of the dissertation was to investigate English as a foreign language (EFL) students' use of their first language (L1) in composing English texts. The first study focused on factors associated with students' spontaneous use of L1 in EFL writing. The research questions of this study concerned how spontaneous L1 use in EFL writing may interact with cognitive demands of writing tasks, learners' English proficiency, and writing quality. Thirty Taiwanese college students from different disciplines participated. Writing tasks included the issue analysis and argument analysis tasks, both derived from GRE and GMAT writing. Students' percentage of L1 use in think-aloud protocols was calculated within each phase of the composing process and compared to the cognitive demands of writing tasks, students' English proficiency, and writing scores. EFL students' percentage of L1 use was found to vary not only by cognitive demands of writing tasks but also by types of writing tasks. Total quantity of L1 use of EFL students was not related to their English proficiency. Further, EFL students' spontaneous use of L1 was found to be associated with better writing quality when used in activities such as making logical transitions, posing questions about logic and content development, or summarizing long chunks of reasoning. The second study, concerning the advantage of L1 used as the only composing language in EFL writing, looked in detail at four cases to examine factors such as the cognitive demands of writing tasks, students' English proficiency, and students' ability to use L1 strategically. The choice of composing language was found to be associated with English writing quality only in cognitively demanding writing tasks, such as argumentation. In argumentation, the advantages of composing in L1 depended on the interaction of students' English proficiency and students' ability to use L1 strategically. Compared to English, L1 Chinese as a composing language was advantageous to writing quality when students had either the ability to use L1 strategically or high English proficiency. On the other hand, L1 as a composing language was disadvantageous to English writing scores when the student had neither the ability to use L1 strategically nor high English proficiency.

"Lin, Grace Huey-Yuh",2007.0,The impact of acculturation on the primary language maintenance of second generation Chinese American immigrants,"This study explores how the socialization experiences of second generation Chinese American immigrants support and encourage them to maintain their primary language, culture, and ethnic identity in their environment during the process of acculturation. This study examines why second generation Chinese American immigrants continue to strive for maintenance of their primary language. Particularly, the study investigates the factors that influence the primary language maintenance and bilingual development, how the immigrant parents contribute to the primary language maintenance in their living context, how second generation Chinese American immigrants adapt to the mainstream educational institutions and the larger society while maintaining their primary language, culture, and ethnic identity. A phenomenological research approach advocated by Polkinghorne (1989) and Moustakas (1994) was employed in this study to describe and interpret the meaning in the personal lived experiences of Chinese American participants who emigrated with their parents to the U.S. at young age. The phenomenological approach called for the words of the participants to provide a window into finding new meanings of bilingual and bicultural development and adjustment in the context of second generation Chinese American immigrants' lived experiences. The data were collected through one-one-one lengthy, in depth, semi-structured interviews with each selected participants to explore and describe the meaning for the individuals who had experienced the phenomenon. Among those participating were three second generation Chinese American immigrants and three immigrant parents. The findings from the interview revealed that when the participant immigrants started entering the mainstream educational systems, they did not realize that it was valuable to continue studying their primary language and retaining their cultural heritage because of the assimilative power from the mainstream educational institutions and the larger society. Since their childhood, their parents, particularly their mothers, took a responsibility to pass on and seek any means to maintain fluency in their primary language. Over time, they all now had great appreciation for their parents, the teachers from the mainstream schools, the teachers from the weekend Chinese schools, and the people from the community that taught, supported, and encouraged them to retain their bilingual and bicultural competences when they grew up in the host country. What emerged from the interviews were their positive attitudes toward the mainstream educational institutions and the larger society which provided them with opportunities (Ogbu, 1985, 1991). They strived to accommodate themselves to the demands from the mainstream educational systems and achieve the academic competences in the dominant society without assimilating and giving up their primary language, culture, and identification within the Chinese ethnic groups (Belden, 1997; Gibson, 1988). In addition, they consciously developed their own unique ethnic identities and considered they could function well in two cultures depending on the situation.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/impact-acculturation-on-primary-language/docview/304851880/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lin, Yi",2004.0,Chinese vocabulary acquisition and learning Chinese as a foreign language,"The present study anchored its inquiry in second language (L2) Chinese vocabulary acquisition (CVA) and learning Chinese as a foreign language. It investigated L2 CVA in four types: phonological comprehension, orthographic comprehension, phonological production and orthographic production, as well as their relationship with each other and with language proficiency. Vocabulary data were collected from Chinese programs in four major universities in the U.S. across seven semester levels. Along with these data, students' language scores were collected. First, descriptive and nonparametric statistics were used to confirm the existence of the four types of vocabulary and their order of development. Then correlation and regression analyses were used to find out how they were associated with each other and with language skills. Finally, the relationship between the distance between vocabulary types and language skills was studied. The study found a developing order for the four types of vocabulary, accounting for between 30% to 50% of the variance in language skill. Phonological comprehension vocabulary was largest but had the weakest relationship with language skills. Phonological production had the second smallest size but the strongest relationship with language skills. Orthographic production had the smallest size and a non-linear relationship with language skills. The distance did not correlate with language skills or correlated negatively with them. It is concluded that vocabulary exists in different sizes and forms and develops along a continuum. Words that linger at lower stages of the continuum contribute less than those at upper stages.

"Lopez Ortega, Nuria Rocio",2002.0,The development of discourse competence in study abroad learners: A study of subject expression in Spanish as a second language,"The study examines the Spanish subjects in discourse and across time for intermediate to advanced learners of Spanish during four and a half months of a study abroad experience. The study focuses on occurrence of NP subjects, pronominal subjects and null subjects in discourse across time (interviews) in four intermediate to advanced L2 Spanish learners. Syntactic, semantic and discursive variables are examined in the quantitative analysis of the oral data. Quantitative analysis of the data according to subject condition and time reveals a strong effect for individual variation, but not a significant effect of time; some of the mentioned variables affect presence or absence of subjects in discourse and some have an over-time effect on one or all of the subject conditions. While the quantitative results of the data do not present conclusive effects on the development of acquisition of subjects, a qualitative analysis of the conversations shows how discourse conditions beyond the traditional aspects of contrast, emphasis and disambiguation affect the presence or absence of subjects. Some of these discursive aspects are speaker's identity and topic involvement, semantic features of the referents, interlinguistic narrative structures, type of verb, conjunctions and adverbials. Detailed analysis of the discourse shows that each learner develops in their use of subjects over time, and allow us to conclude that, (1)&#xa0;there are some common tendencies according to proficiency stages; (2)&#xa0;L2 discourse patterns successfully mark contrast, emphasis or disambiguation, thus creating cohesion in the text; and (3)&#xa0;despite individual variation and the difficulty to establish a common tendency towards the native norm, the four learners become more proficient on their expression of Spanish subjects after a their study-abroad experience.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-discourse-competence-study-abroad/docview/251797058/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lozano, Cristobal",2006.0,Focus and split-intransitivity: the acquisition of word order alternations in non-native Spanish,"Recent unrelated studies reveal what appears to be a common acquisitional pattern in second language acquisition (SLA). While some findings show that advanced learners can indeed achieve convergent, native-like competence with formal syntactic properties (even when these are underdetermined by the input), other findings suggest that they can display divergent and even optional competence at the syntax-discourse interface with discursive properties like focus and topic. These apparently contradictory observations are not coincidental, as they can also be traced in other acquisitional studies on L1 acquisition, L1 attrition in bilinguals, child SLA and SLI (specific language impairment). If this pattern is correct, it should be observed in the L2 acquisition of any given property that is simultaneously governed by both a formal grammatical constraint and a discursive constraint. I tested whether this is the case in advanced non-native Spanish acquisition of the syntactic distribution of subject-verb (SV) and verb-subject (VS) word order, which is constrained by both a formal syntactic property (the Unaccusative Hypothesis or Split-intransitivity Hypothesis) and a property at the syntax-discourse interface (presentational focus). Results show that the interlanguage grammars (ILGs) of both English ( n = 17) and Greek (n = 18) learners of Spanish converge with the grammars of native Spanish speakers (n = 14) when formal properties are involved, yet they diverge (in particular by showing optionality) with discursive focus. These results confirm the emerging view that acquisition of formal syntactic properties is more readily acquired than discourse properties, which are persistently problematic.", Journal Article,10.1191/0267658306sr264oa,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/focus-split-intransitivity-acquisition-word-order/docview/200213293/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Lu, Xuehong",2007.0,Motivational orientations in Chinese learning—Heritage and non-heritage college students in the United States,"This is a study of educational motivation for Chinese language acquisition in the higher learning context. To study the effect of motivation on language learning and learning outcomes of a Mandarin Chinese language learner, I measured integrative motivation, instrumental motivation, and a learner's attitudinal motivation, i.e. the orientation of attitude toward the language learning situations and examined how each influences Chinese language learning and a learner's learning outcomes. Given the heterogeneous nature of the Chinese language learners in the United States college classrooms, I divided the learners into two major classes: Chinese heritage language learners (HLLs), and Non-heritage learners (NHLLs). However, given the significant differences among NHLLs, in my analyses I further divided the NHLLs into two sub-groups: Eastern Asian non-heritage language learners, and Other non-heritage language learners. Students studied in this dissertation were registered in Chinese classes at the State University of New York at Buffalo. They were asked to complete a questionnaire that assesses (a)&#xa0;their integrative and instrumental orientations for learning Chinese, and (b)&#xa0;their attitudes toward the learning situations such as instructor/course specifics, group/peer specifics, and environment specifics—such as their attitudes toward a mixed classroom setting of heritage language learners (HLLs) and non-heritage language learners (NHLLs). Enrollments in Chinese language classes have been increasing across the United States. In most college Chinese language classes HLLs and NHLL are mixed. This study contributes to the literature on teaching and learning Chinese, and to the literature regarding internationalizing American higher education. It will help to improve Chinese language curriculums and programs at the higher education level in the United States, especially in the following aspects: (1)&#xa0;establishing connections between various motivations and academic learning outcomes for heritage language learners (HLLs) in comparison with non-heritage language learners (NHLLs), and (2)&#xa0;finding out the effects of learners' attitudes toward a mixed classroom learning environment in relation to their language learning and language learning outcomes for various heritage groups. In addition, the results gained from this comparative study should help to persuade higher education administrators and government policy makers that HLLs and NHLLs require separate classrooms, subsidiary materials, support organizations and specially trained language professionals that are capable of meeting their specific educational demands.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/motivational-orientations-chinese-learning/docview/304775303/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Luo, Lynn Yu",2005.0,A systemic functional perspective on native and non -native English speaking students' online discussion in a mixed -mode graduate seminar,"In North America, computer-mediated communication is increasingly used as a means of communication for university courses generally involving both native English speaking (NES) and non-native English speaking (NNES) students. How do they participate in online interaction? How does their academic discourse develop during online interactions? Can a functional linguistic approach illuminate aspects of these questions overlooked by a more traditional linguistic approach? Adopting the systemic functional linguistics perspective, this exploratory qualitative study addresses these issues by examining the perspectives and experiences of fourteen graduate students (5 NNES focal participants and 9 NES students) participating in online discussion in a mixed-mode graduate seminar at a Canadian university. Collected from a three-week summer course, the data for analysis mainly consisted of observations of face-to-face classroom discussions and online discussions, questionnaires, interviews, and online protocols. This study explored online discussion at multiple levels: the social practice level, the discourse level, and the sentence/clause level. At the social practice level, the findings illustrated that online discussion, as a new social practice to the participants, was a very complex endeavor in a larger sociocultural context. The online participants brought to the online forum a wide range of backgrounds and experiences as well as varied voices and perspectives on this instructional innovation. At the discourse level, the study illustrated ongoing construction of online discourse and its complexities, dilemmas and negotiations. The results showed that the construction of an online register was a sociocultural linguistic process which involves education, culture, agency, and identity. Turning to the sentence/clause level, the findings illustrated an analysis of functional recasts in students' online interactions and addressed issues of advanced language development. As the first systemic functional inquiry on online discussion by NES and NNES graduate students at multiple levels, this study points to the need for research in this area that follows a systemic functional perspective.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/systemic-functional-perspective-on-native-non/docview/305349655/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Lyddon, Paul A.",2007.0,The efficacy of corrective feedback and target form enhancement in promoting acquisition of the <i>à/au/en/aux</i> distinction in L2 French,"Despite popular theoretical arguments against the usefulness of explicit knowledge in the development of linguistic competence (cf. Krashen, 1982; Schwartz, 1993), empirical studies have suggested that comprehensible input alone may be insufficient in fostering target-like L2 production skills (Swain, 1985; Hammerly, 1987; Klein &amp; Perdue, 1997). As such, many SLA researchers (e.g., Long, 1991; 1996; 2007; Spada, 1997; Lyster, 1998; 2001; 2004) now advocate teacher use of negative feedback during communicative activities to promote learner noticing of errors and internalization of correct forms; yet the efficacy of this practice remains questionable as it not only entails the provision of additional input but generally enhances otherwise non-salient linguistic features as well (Leeman, 2003). Moreover, these potentially confounding variables may be particularly problematic with regard to the acquisition of grammatical structures bearing little informational content such as the à/au/en/aux distinction before French toponyms. In a controlled experiment with a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest design, all French 102 students at the University of Arizona in Fall 2006 were randomly assigned to an interactive, computer-based reading lesson featuring either typographically enhanced or unenhanced target forms and one of four types of corrective feedback: meaning-focused, implicit form-focused, simple explicit form-focused, or explicit form-focused with rule explanation. Statistical analyses of the results on both the short-term and long-term linguistic outcome measures showed continuous improvement in target structure accuracy for learners in all treatment conditions. However, there was no significant advantage for any of the investigated feedback types, nor for target form enhancement, and no interaction between these two variables. This study assessed learners' pre-treatment performance on the target structures but not their explicit prior knowledge of them. Thus, it is possible that a fine-tuning of the latter through exposure to comprehensible input reduced the magnitude of the learning effects, especially given the proximity of the target prepositions to their objects. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that neither highlighting nor repeated correction and explanation of these particular grammatical items yields any additional benefit and that instructional efforts may better be focused on maximizing beginning learners' opportunities to process authentic language through meaningful activities.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/efficacy-corrective-feedback-target-form/docview/304893667/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

A quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data detected patterns in the learners' directive production. The analysis considered factors such as instruction, L2 grammatical competence, and the influence of the first language (L1) to illustrate the patterns of development of L2 pragmatics at lower proficiency levels. The results show (a) verb forms with increased morphological complexity replaced lower level directive strategies, possibly as a result of the expansion of L2 grammatical competence; (b) pragmatic competence seems to precede grammatical competence; and (c) the L1 pragmatic system appears to play a role in interpreting and processing new L2 data for use in production.",,10.1111/J.1540-4781.2006.00427.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1540-4781.2006.00427.X,ancestry

M. Al-Ali,2006.0,Genre-pragmatic Strategies in English Letter-of-application Writing of Jordanian Arabic–English Bilinguals,"This study reports an investigation of the genre components and pragmatic strategies of letters of applications written by Jordanian Arabic–English bilinguals. Specifically it is set up to trace how far novice non-native speakers of English are able to utilise the generic components and politeness strategies of the target language that strongly correlate with communicative success in social interactions. A corpus of 90 job application letters written by 90 job applicants was collected and analysed within the move structure analysis proposed by Bhatia (1993) and the framework of Brown and Levinson's (1987) model of politeness. The results indicate that politeness strategies are inappropriately utilised and the genre components are poorly managed in the letters of applications. The letters reflect particular strategic moves that are not usually utilised by English native speakers. The bilingual writers tend to avoid negative politeness but make frequent inappropriate use of positive politeness strategies due to their ignorance of the social-cultural constraints governing their selection. This suggests a difference based on areas of cultural transfer rather than on a language effect. We hope the results of this study will be of help to foreign language instructors in increasing their students' consciousness of cross-cultural preferences, the essential genre specific meaning components and appropriate pragmatic strategies in order to write in a manner that is acceptable to native speakers of the target language.",,10.1080/13670050608668633,https://doi.org/10.1080/13670050608668633,forward

We particularly focused on proficiency-level effects and on the role of the task type in the use of request acts peripheral modification devices. We ascertained participants' degree of bilingual competence by means of a bilingualism test, which was designed on the basis of previous research (Li Wei, 2000). Additionally, a level placement test was distributed to our participants, and their performance was assessed on the basis of the ACTFL proficiency guidelines. Data for our analysis were collected by means of an open discourse completion test and a role-play task. Results from our analysis point to differences between bilinguals' and monolinguals' use of peripheral modification devices. More specifically our study shows that (1) L3 learners of English employed request modifiers more frequently and appropriately than L2 English learners, (2) intermediate learners performed better than beginner learners both in the oral and written task, and (3) the written task allowed for a wider use of peripheral modification devices although results also show that internal modification devices were highly employed in the oral task. Findings from our study seem to call for further research on the pragmatic competence of third language learners of English thereby considering other speech acts or pragmatic aspects and also by analysing subjects from different linguistic backgrounds.",,10.1080/14790710508668378,https://doi.org/10.1080/14790710508668378,forward

However, for this shift to happen, materials designers need to assess critically the effects of the techno-logical capabilities of Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) as well as the features that characterize a potentially new type of literacy. Such a critical assessment will have to be based on the analysis of how specific pedagogical objectives are achieved through the design and implementation of instructional activities in CMC environments. In this respect, the analysis of such theoretical constructs as the grounding criterion and the principle of least collaborative effort (Clark & Brennan, 1991) provides a useful framework for the examination of factors that affect the choice of communication medium. In particular, different learning objectives may be achieved with a variety of technological tools (e.g., from word processors to collaborative writing software) that exhibit a range of levels of technical sophistication.",,10.1111/0026-7902.00050,https://doi.org/10.1111/0026-7902.00050,ancestry

"M. Swain, Sharon Lapkin",2001.0,Focus on form through collaborative dialogue: Exploring task effects,"In our recent research we have been using tasks as a stimulus for generating talk among students (Swain and Lapkin, 1998). We have been interested in discovering whether, through output (the activities of talking and/or writing), learners notice gaps in their linguistic knowledge, triggering an analysis of input or of existing internal resources to fill those gaps (Swain and Lapkin, 1995); whether learners' output serves as a hypothesis of how to convey their intended meaning (Swain, 1995); and whether learners use language to reflect on their own (or their interlocutors') language use that is, whether learners externalise their hypotheses about form and meaning, exposing those hypotheses to scrutiny and discussion (Swain, 1998; 2000). Our research has involved a search for tasks that will generate this sort of student talk with the goal of demonstrating its relationship to second language learning. The tasks we have used to generate such talk engage students in linguistic problem solving, are done collaboratively, and involve the production of a spoken and written text. Studies such as those of Donate (1994), LaPierre (1994; see also Swain, 1998), Swain and Lapkin (1998) and Tse (1996) suggest that the talk which surfaces when students collaborate in solving linguistic problems encountered m communicative task performance represents second language learning in progress. In these studies, later language use has been traced back to dialogue occurring as the students worked collaboratively to express their intended meaning and carry out the task at hand. In these dialogic exchanges related to their ongoing language use, noticing, hypothesis formulation, and hypothesis testing have been observed to have taken place. These studies have relied on pedagogical tasks to serve as the stimulus to collaborative dialogue (Swain, 1997a). One of the main rationales offered in the literature for using communicative tasks in language teaching is that second language acquisition is enhanced through the negotiation of meaning: '. . . language learning is assisted through the social interaction of learners and their interlocutors, particularly when they Negotiate toward mutual comprehension of each other's message meaning'",,10.4324/9781315838267-14,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315838267-14,ancestry

In this study, 60 adult native speakers of Japanese with intermediate-level proficiency in English were each randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups, which consisted of 3 treatment groups and 1 control group. Each treatment group received one of the following kinds of instruction in English pragmatics: (a) deductive instruction, (b) inductive instruction with problem-solving tasks, or (c) inductive instruction with structured input tasks. Both the deductive and inductive approaches constituted different types of explicit input-based instruction. The purpose was to teach the learners how to use lexical/phrasal downgraders and syntactic downgraders in English to perform complex requests. All participants completed a pretest, a posttest, and a follow-up test. Each test included 2 receptive judgment tasks and 2 production tasks.

"Marinova-Todd, Stefka H.",2003.0,Comprehensive analysis of ultimate attainment in adult second language acquisition,"This dissertation consists of three articles examining, both theoretically and empirically, the ultimate attainment of post-pubescent second language learners. The first article is a comprehensive review of the literature on the ultimate attainment in adult second language (L2) acquisition. Growing research evidence shows that there are some adult learners who achieve native-like proficiency in their L2 and emphasizes the necessity to study these learners in greater detail than has traditionally been done. Based on the research reviewed, several areas of study are identified that still need to be addressed by empirical research. Therefore, the second article discusses an empirical study that examined the linguistic performance of highly proficient adult L2 learners across major domains of language knowledge (e.g., pronunciation, vocabulary size, grammar and language use) and compared their performance to that of a control group of native speakers of English. Results from a multivariate analysis of variance indicate that on measures of pronunciation, vocabulary size and grammar knowledge, the group of L2 learners performed significantly worse than the group of native speakers. However, analyses of the individual performance of the L2 learners on the different tasks revealed that at least 40% of them performed within the native range. In addition, three profiles of the highly proficient learners are discussed in greater detail revealing that some of them achieve native-like proficiency across all the domains of L2 knowledge under examination. The final article isolates some background factors (e.g., age of arrival and length of residence in the L2 setting, amount of formal L2 study, intensity of L2 input, level of formal education and degree of motivation to achieve high levels of proficiency in the L2) that are associated with the L2 learners' proficiency in the different L2 domains. This analysis concluded that current experiential factors, such as use of English and its importance to the learner, best predicted the ultimate attainment in this group of highly proficient adult L2 learners.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comprehensive-analysis-ultimate-attainment-adult/docview/305331855/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Martinovic-Zic, Aida",2009.0,Tense or Aspect?: Effects of L1 Tense/ Aspect Prominence in L2 Acquisition,"This study introduces a typological model of the conceptual language-specific approach to the L2 research on the acquisition of tense-aspect. The model is based on the typological notion of prominence, classifying languages into tense-prominent and aspect-prominent (Bhat 1999) and the L1 research proposal that language-specific lexicalization patterns have a role in shaping form-function mappings in child language (Berman and Slobin 1994, Slobin 1991, 1996a, 1996b). The study represents an attempt to investigate language-specific L1 effects (Odlin 2005) in the L2 acquisition of complex form-function grammatical domains, such as tense-aspect. The most influential L2 tense-aspect research has focused on the acquisition of verb morphology (form-to-function analysis) and the acquisition of temporality (function-to-form analysis, respectively (Bardovi-Harlig 2000). The research investigated the Aspect Hypothesis (Andersen 1991, Andersen and Shirai 1994, Bardovi-Harlig 1992), the Discourse Hypothesis (Bardovi-Harlig 1995), and the Prototype Hypothesis (Shirai 1991, Li and Shirai 2000). Based on Vendler (1967), these studies explore the L2 acquisition of inherent verb aspect in comparison to grammatical aspect and tense. L2 research on specific L1/L2 contexts has not been of major interests to the L2 scholars. Turning to the specific L1/L2 features of tense-aspect prominence and aspect-prominence, this bi-directional study tests the Grammatical Domain Hypothesis (GDH) with two groups of intermediate--high intermediate instructed L2 learners: L1 English (tense-prominent)/L2 Russian (N=21) and L1 Russian (aspect-prominent/L2 English (N= 11). The L2 data were elicited on two written tasks: a cloze task and a Frog Story task, with the native speaker responses as the baseline for both tasks. The results are categorized as follows: target/non-target use of tense-aspect (task 1); non-target morphological forms, tense-aspect substitutions, lexical aspectual means, and idiosyncratic clausal strategies (task 2). The findings reveal L2 tendencies supporting the GDH: L1 English/L2 Russian learners show 'tense bias', while limiting the aspectual choices. Conversely, L1 Russian/L2 English learners show 'aspect bias' while inconsistently mixing L2 tenses. Potential methodological and interpretation problems are presented in the conclusion, followed by the pedagogical implications the study may have on the instructional methods in teaching tense-aspect to L2 learners from the typologically mismatching L1's.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/tense-aspect-effects-l1-prominence-l2-acquisition/docview/1984613849/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

María del Mar Galindo Merino,2005.0,La incorporación del nivel pragmático a la investigación sobre los procesos de transferencia en la adquisición de segundas lenguas,"From its birth, research in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) has always studied the transfer of linguistic elements from the mother tongue to the target language shown by non-native speakers. Due to its presence in the learning of a second language, transfer has been tackled from a wide range of perspectives along the last fifty years, but its pragmatic dimension has been recognized recently, encouraging nowadays the development of this field. This article aims to describe the process of transfer by covering the research about it, from the first studies taking this element into account through the later ones, that include the analysis of pragmatic transfer. We now revise the main literature as regards linguistic and pragmatic transfer in the Englishspeaking tradition as well as in Spain. Specifically, we approach the role of transfer in the learning of a L2, focusing on the arrival of Pragmatics to the teaching of foreign languages in general and to the studies about transfer in SLA in particular. We finish with some thoughts about the handling of pragmatic transfer in the second language classroom.",,10.14198/ELUA2005.19.07,https://doi.org/10.14198/ELUA2005.19.07,forward

"Matsui, Shiro",2000.0,The relevance of the native language in foreign language acquisition: The critical period hypothesis for foreign language pronunciation,"This study assessed how learners' first language (L1) and their learning experience interact in acquiring second language (L2) phonology if exposure to the target language (TL) starts post-pubertally. According to the Critical Period Hypothesis, it is impossible to acquire native fluency in a language after puberty. The Speech Learning Model posits that, unlike the Contrastive Analysis notion (“the more different L1 and L2 are, the more difficult”), a partial similarity of L2 to L1 can be detrimental. Lengthy exposure to L2 enables learners to establish categories for “new” sounds, whereas equivalent classification, or replacement of L2 features with neighboring L1 sounds, blocks the learners' access to “similar but not identical” sounds. It was hypothesized that “similar” sounds would be difficult, regardless of learners' developmental stages, but that the experienced subjects, having established categories, would produce and perceive “new” sounds authentically. Eighty-two nonnative speakers whose L1 was English, Chinese, or Korean, and eight native speakers of Japanese, participated in the experiments. In Experiment 1, global foreign accent was evaluated by a sentence reading task. In Experiments 2 and 3, subjects demonstrated their ability to produce and perceive “new” and “similar but not identical” sounds. There was not a single non-native subject whose global foreign accent was judged as native-like; however, several subjects produced and perceived isolated words within the native range. For all of the experiments, the L1 effect was found to exist. These findings challenge the view that the critical period for L2 is an all-or-nothing phenomenon biologically constrained in any language learning situation. Adult learners' degree of performance in producing and perceiving L2 sounds is highly affected by the relative distance between L1 and L2.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/relevance-native-language-foreign-acquisition/docview/304636465/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Michael H. Long,1983.0,Does Second Language Instruction Make a Difference? A Review of Research,"Does second language instruction promote second language acquisition? Some studies conclude that instruction does not help (or even that it is counter-productive); others find it beneficial. The picture becomes clearer if two distinctions are made. First, researchers may address one or both of two issues: the absolute effect of instruction, on the one hand, and its relative utility, on the other. Second, studies need to be subclassified according to whether or not the comparisons they make involve controlling for the total amount of instruction, exposure, or instruction plus exposure-that is, for the total opportunity to acquire the second language. Observing these distinctions, a review of research findings concludes that there is considerable (although not overwhelming) evidence that instruction is beneficial 1) for children as well as adults, 2) for beginning, intermediate, and advanced students, 3) on integrative as well as discrete-point tests, and 4) in acquisition-rich as well as acquisition-poor environments.

A variety of units, including word, structure, notion, function, topic, and situation, continue to be employed in synthetic, Type A, syllabuses. While each is relevant for analyses of the target language and its use, nativelike linguistic elements find little support as meaningful acquisition units from a language learner's perspective. Task has more recently appeared as the unit of analysis in three analytic, (primarily) Type B, alternatives: procedural, process, and task syllabuses. Each of these has certain limitations, too, but when the task syllabus is combined with a focus on form in task-based language teaching, the task receives more support in second language acquisition (SLA) research as a viable unit around which to organize language teaching and learning opportunities.",,10.2307/3587368,https://doi.org/10.2307/3587368,ancestry
"Miller, Mark Campbell",1992.0,Two experimental studies of the effectiveness of interactive game-playing in the acquisition of Japanese by Americans. (Volumes I and II),"The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that ""optimal L2 acquisition occurs through the playing of games."" Three Japanese language classes were taught for American university students over a two-year, four-semester period. Two classes used games as the primary instructional technique. A third control class was taught using traditional procedures. One game class provided native speaking Japanese mediators, explicit grammar explanations, sample demonstrations, detailed directions, strict control by the instructor, and transfer aids. The other game class had no mediators and avoided the explicit provision of the instructional variables listed above. At the end of each semester the students in all three classes were given a Cloze, an oral interview, and a written essay test. The mean scores were measured and analyzed by the univariate procedure and one-way and two-way ANOVAs. Extensive surveys, interviews, and ethnographic observations were conducted to complement the experiment. The results are as follows: (1) There were no significant differences between any two or among all three classes on any of the three tests after each of the four semesters. (2) The game classes outperformed the control class on all three tests by the fourth semester. (3) The score ranges in the game classes were smaller, suggesting that the transfer of L1 cognitive/academic language proficiency (CALP) to L2 acquisition is greater in traditional language classes than in game classes. Conversely, students with less L1 CALP can be more successful in game classes by relying on their basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS). (4) Significant differences were obtained when combined mean scores for all three classes were compared by semester. It is suggested that the introduction of imperative verb forms and relative/dependent clauses in the second and third semesters, respectively, lowered the scores of all three classes, regardless of the instructional method employed. This finding suggests the acquisition of Japanese as a L2 is constrained by processing constraints, not input constraints. The surveys, interviews, and ethnographic data indicate that while games are popular, they need to be carefully designed and employed to enable an entire L2 curriculum to be successfully developed around them.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/two-experimental-studies-effectiveness/docview/303984123/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

[...]the close relationship between SLA and L1 loss has been implicit and explicit in a number of very recent studies stressing the nding that in many grammatical areas, bilinguals and L2 learners have been shown to end up with very similar grammars (Lynch, 1999; Sorace, 1999; 2000a; Grel, 2002; Jordens, 2002; Montrul, 2002; 2004a).

"Mori, Junko",1996.0,Negotiating agreement and disagreement: The use of connective expressions in Japanese conversations,"The present study investigates ways in which Japanese speakers negotiate agreement and disagreement in sequences involving opinion or evaluation. Using the sociological methodology of ""conversation analysis"" (CA) (cf. Sacks, Schegloff, Jefferson) as a central framework for analysis, the present thesis explicates the sequential development of negotiation towards agreement as well as the structure of each turn within the sequence. Further, this study, as a part of the growing body of research on ""interaction and grammar,"" explores the relationship between the structures of social interaction and the structures of the language, focusing on the recurrent use of two structurally different types of connective expressions: the clause-initial connectives, dakara, datte, and demo, and the clause-final connective particles, -kara, and -kedo. The use of these different types of ""causal"" or ""contrastive"" markers exhibits the speaker's engagement in different types of activities involved in the negotiation of their opinions and evaluations. The goal of this study is to examine the occurrences of these markers with reference to the sequential environment of their use and the interactional activities accomplished by their use. As an initial step in the application of the CA methodology to Japanese conversations, the present thesis suggests the existence of some generic organizations of conversational interaction common across languages and cultures. The data, which consist of six audio-recorded causal conversations among Japanese adult peers, demonstrate that the Japanese speakers shape agreeing or disagreeing turns, or respond to actual or anticipated problems in interaction, in remarkably similar ways to those reported in the CA studies of American English conversations. On the other hand, the structural differences between the languages, namely English and Japanese, appear to alter the kinds of resources available for accomplishing a particular action; they also seem to partially change the temporal realization of actions in progress. Through the close analysis of ""opinion-negotation"" sequences and the use of connective expressions within those sequences, the present study explores the interplay of the structural differences between the languages and the realization of the potentially universal features of human interaction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/negotiating-agreement-disagreement-use-connective/docview/304284707/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

More specifically, this study investigates a practice of 'embodied completion' (Olsher 2004), namely the practice of deploying a partial turn of talk that offers a projectable trajectory of ongoing action and completing that action with a gesture or other embodied display. The participants' conduct that precedes this embodied completion reveals the local processes used to evaluate, discover, and establish shared linguistic and non-linguistic resources in pursuing intersubjectivity. Further, the sequence of actions that follows the embodied completion provides an incidental, interactionally motivated opportunity for the L1 speaker to reformulate what the L2 speaker has said with a more sophisticated linguistic expression. Through the close analysis of two focal cases of embodied completion, which underscores the conversation analytic (CA) perspective of 'competences as resources,' this study explores the kinds of contributions that can be made by using CA's explication of interactional details towards the understanding of language learning as it occurs in socially situated practices.", Journal Article,,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/achievement-intersubjectivity-through-embodied/docview/203922294/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Mori, Masako",1995.0,Reading bilingually: Cross-linguistic study of reading comprehension in English and Japanese by intermediate and advanced level Japanese speakers of English as a Second Language (ESL) and English speakers of Japanese as a Foreign Language (JFL),"L2 reading is paradoxical and ambiguous because it aims at ""reading for meaning"" and ""reading for language learning"" at the same time. The present study investigated how people read English and Japanese expository texts as either L1 or L2. Using think-aloud protocols while reading texts, comprehension processes were compared between L1 and L2 readers, as well as low- and high-L2 proficiency readers, quantitatively and qualitatively. The comprehension product data (comprehension question scores, summary scores) complemented the results. The multivariate design was 2 (L1 background: Native Reader of English (NRE), Native Reader of Japanese (NRJ)) by 2 (L2 proficiency level: high, low) by 2 (reading condition: silent, think-aloud) by 4 (texts: E1, E2, J1, J2), with the first two as between-subject and the second two as within-subject variables. The results of qualitative analysis indicated: (1) There were very clear differences between L1 and L2 reading in all measures. L1 reading comprehension was almost always better than L2 reading comprehension regardless of language in all measures. (2) Detailed analysis of think-aloud protocols showed that L1 reading proceeded by using ""reacting/responding,"" ""evaluative comment,"" and ""self-questioning"" strategies-all top-down strategies. L2 reading, on the other hand, was characterized by a combination of three basic bottom-up strategies: ""questioning of vocabulary,"" ""translating,"" and ""word-solving."" (3) The effect of proficiency was found only partially in NRE in comprehension question scores and as an interaction between proficiency and strategy types of think-aloud data. Strategically, high L2 proficiency readers used more metacognitive strategies (comment on own strategy; monitor comprehension) than low L2 readers. (4) No effect was found with reading conditions (silent, think-aloud) in all measures. Qualitative analysis of think-aloud protocols and four case studies revealed insightful processes happening during reading in the course of time. The most important finding was that L1 reading operated in a social-dialogic dimension, while L2 reading tended to lack this dimension and be confined within a text linguistic domain. A new model of reading to expand the cognitive reading model and to incorporate a social dimension was proposed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/reading-bilingually-cross-linguistic-study/docview/304200499/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Morise, Yumiko",1998.0,A discourse analysis of negotiated interactions in oral proficiency interviews: Japanese learners of English as a Second Language,"The increased demand for the development of communicative language use in second language (L2) education has led to language-assessment practices designed to demonstrate L2 learners' ability to use language in 'real-life' situations. While there has been a widely accepted view that the most adequate method is the oral proficiency interview (OPI), one critical issue is to what degree OPI methods can replicate 'real-life' language use. This study addresses this issue by identifying the types and frequency of repair strategies used by both interviewers and Japanese learners of English as a second language to overcome communication problems, and sequence patterns and functions in twelve tape-recorded OPIs at four proficiency levels (1+, 2, 2+, and 3). It also examines the nature of OPI negotiated interactions in comparison with that of native speaker (NS)-nonnative speaker (NNS) interactions in previous second language acquisition (SLA) research. The results suggest that negotiated interactions that take place in resolving communication problems during an OPI, in a broad sense, resemble those that have been demonstrated in SLA research. However, since one important requirement of the OPI is to demonstrate candidates' limitations in communicating, interviewers attempt to push at the boundaries of the candidates' proficiency rather than striving to stay within them. Unlike NSs in SLA-research settings, interviewers manipulate repair discourse and the amount and quality of repair strategies in an attempt to elicit ratable speech samples. For this reason, OPI negotiations typically persist much longer than those seen in SLA research. Candidates, regardless of proficiency levels, more frequently initiate overt indications of communication difficulties. They also produce a larger amount of elaborated speech, exhibiting their efforts to demonstrate their communication skills. Results suggest that this form of negotiation is an important aspect of the OPI assessment. Further examination of the OPI negotiated interactions suggests that the following variability factors merit closer attention in future research and in improving current OPI practices: various situational and individual characteristics, interviewers' diagnostic skills and the nature of their support, and interviewers' judgments about the quality of changes produced in candidates' performance during negotiation processes.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/discourse-analysis-negotiated-interactions-oral/docview/304436159/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Morita, Kyoko",2002.0,Negotiating identity politics: Exploring Brazilian children's experiences at a Japanese school,"Since the early 1990s, more and more Brazilians of Japanese descent have migrated back to Japan and settled in Japanese local communities. As they send their children to Japanese public schools, these children sometimes have difficulty adjusting both academically and socially. This dissertation presents case studies of three Japanese-Brazilian students enrolled in a Japanese elementary school. I describe various dimensions of their experiences in school, and I follow their crosscultural adjustment over time. Data come from ethnographic research conducted during three four-month cycles, in the school and surrounding community. Analysis of these data indicates that two key factors influenced these students' acculturation in the Japanese school: (1)&#xa0; interpersonal identity , in which the students constructed positive senses of themselves as they participated in social groups and built relationships with other co-members; and (2)&#xa0; intra-minority politics , in which the students constructed positive senses of themselves by either associating themselves with or differentiating themselves from students who were also different from the mainstream. The analysis shows how the three students actively took control of their identities and struggled to create positive senses of themselves. Because of the agency displayed by the students, these data show the need for theories that do not rely solely on mismatches between minority and majority students' ways of behaving. These students managed to integrate socially and advance academically, by creatively using the skills and identity-resources available to them, thus showing how the supposedly homogenous and homogenizing Japanese educational system can in fact serve ethnic-minority children.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/negotiating-identity-politics-exploring-brazilian/docview/305508061/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Muriel Warga, Ursula Schölmberger",2007.0,The acquisition of French apologetic behavior in a study abroad context,"Abstract Research in interlanguage pragmatics and sociolinguistics has suggested that foreign language learners have difficulties in reaching higher levels of pragmatic and sociolinguistic competence without receiving specific instruction or without spending some time in the target speech community (Dewaele 2002; Warga 2004). The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effect of a period of immersion in the target language community on the pragmatic development of foreign language learners of French in the area of apologies. The study, thus, adds to the scarce body of literature on pragmatic development in general and on the pragmatics of French as an L2 in particular. The participants in this longitudinal study are seven Austrian learners of French who studied at the Université de Montréal in Quebec for a period of ten months. Base-line data elicited from native speakers (NSs) of Quebecois French and NSs of Austrian German are also analyzed. The methods of data collection include a four-item discourse completion task designed to elicit the speech act of apology and a questionnaire completed before and after the year abroad. The analysis reveals that while some aspects of apologetic behavior approximate the Quebecois French NS norm over time spent in the target language community (e.g., decrease of Justifications), other aspects remain unaffected by the exposure (e.g., frequency of IFIDs) or even shift away from the L2 norm (e.g., increase in the use of two upgraders). Overall, a coexistence of target-like and non-target-like developments was observed in the data. Moreover, many of the features investigated were found to develop in a non-linear—rather than linear—fashion. It is, therefore, suggested that future studies in the field take a more dynamic perspective in order to obtain a fuller understanding of the path of pragmatic development.",,10.1515/IP.2007.012,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP.2007.012,forward
N. Ellis,2006.0,Language Acquisition as Rational Contingency Learning,"This paper considers how fluent language users are rational in their language processing, their unconscious language representation systems optimally prepared for comprehension and production, how language learners are intuitive statisticians, and how acquisition can be understood as contingency learning. But there are important aspects of second language acquisition that do not appear to be rational, where input fails to become intake. The paper describes the types of situation where cognition deviates from rationality and it introduces how the apparent irrationalities of L2 acquisition result from standard phenomena of associative learning as encapsulated in the models of Rescorla and Wagner (1972) and Cheng and Holyoak (1995), which describe how cue salience, outcome importance, and the history of learning from multiple probabilistic cues affect the development of ‘learned selective attention’ and transfer. This article considers how fluent language users are rational in their language processing, rational in the sense that their unconscious language representation systems are optimally prepared for comprehension and production. In this view, language learners are intuitive statisticians, weighing the likelihoods of interpretations and predicting which constructions are likely in the current context, and language acquisition is contingency learning, that is the gathering of information about the relative frequencies of form‐function mappings. These arguments are well supported by the psycholinguistic evidence relating to first language. But there are important aspects of second language acquisition that do not appear to accord with this characterization, those aspects where despite massive experience of naturalistic input and usage, the system fails to become optimally tuned to represent the second language forms, their functions, and their contextualized likelihoods of occurrence. The article builds the framework for an explanation of the seeming irrationalities of L2 acquisition in terms of standard phenomena of associative learning involving ‘learned selective attention.’ In order to place L1 and L2 in the context of a rational analysis of language learning, I first illustrate the problem by considering the design of word processors of a more mechanical kind than is the ultimate goal of our inquiry. Having thus set a concrete stage, I outline the process of the rational analysis of learning and memory (Anderson 1989, 1991b; Anderson and Milson 1989; Anderson and Schooler 2000).

They consider the psycholinguistics of language learning following general cognitive principles of category learning, with schematic constructions emerging from usage. They analyze how learning is driven by the frequency and frequency distribution of exemplars within construction, the salience of their form, the significance of their functional interpretation, the match of their meaning to the construction prototype, and the reliability of their mappings. These investigations address a range of morphological and syntactic constructions in instructed, uninstructed, and laboratory settings. They include both experimental and corpus-based approaches (some conducted longitudinally) and consider the relationship between input and acquisition in the short term and over time, with a particular emphasis on spoken input directed to second and foreign language learners.

"Nagata, Noriko",1992.0,A study of the effectiveness of intelligent CALI as an application of natural language processing,"Computers have long been regarded as a potential tool for accelerating the learning of a foreign language. Unfortunately, many attempts to incorporate computers into foreign language instruction have met with failure. One obstacle has been the relative 'primitiveness' of the existing Computer-Assisted Language Instruction (CALI) systems. Such systems typically provide mechanical drills involving fill-in-the-blank or multiple-choice questions, and utilize a ""wrong-try-again"" approach to interaction that offers little corrective feedback. In this study, I developed a new CALI system, called ""Nihongo-CALI"". This system employs one type of artificial intelligence approach, Natural Language Processing, to facilitate more sophisticated error analysis and feedback. The Nihongo-CALI system uses Natural Language Processing to analyze the learners responses in light of the morphological and syntactic rules of the Japanese language, and provides feedback explaining the errors in terms of grammatical functions and thematic roles of the sentence. The present study investigates the effect of the type of CALI exercises (traditional CALI exercises involving conventional feedback or intelligent CALI exercises providing sophisticated feedback) on students' language achievement and attitudes toward CALI exercises. The Nihongo-CALI system was implemented for both traditional CALI and intelligent CALI exercises, to process and to analyze the learner's input, but provided only limited feedback in simulating the traditional CALI approach. An experiment was performed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of these two types of Nihongo-CALI exercises. Thirty-four subjects in the second-year Japanese language course at the University of Pittsburgh participated in the experiment. The study found a statistically significant difference between the intelligent CALI and traditional CALI groups in the learners' achievement on the target structures, favoring the intelligent CALI group. The study suggests that the traditional feedback is as good as the intelligent feedback in helping learners to correct word-level errors (e.g., vocabulary and conjugation errors), while the intelligent feedback is more helpful for understanding and correcting sentence-level errors (e.g., particle errors).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/study-effectiveness-intelligent-cali-as/docview/304002080/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nakahama, Yuko",2003.0,Cross -linguistic influence on the development of referential topic management in L2 Japanese oral narratives,"Within the framework of a functional approach to an understanding of language development (e.g. Givón, 1995; Klein, 1990; Tomlin, 1990), this study investigates cross-linguistic influence (CLI) on the management of referential topics in oral narratives of Japanese as a second language (L2). In order to examine how language distance plays a role in the L2 learning processes, discourse produced by two groups of learners of Japanese, one whose first language (L1) is typologically similar to and one whose L1 is distant from Japanese (Korean and English, correspondingly) was investigated. Furthermore, discourse produced at three different proficiency levels for each L1 was compared in order to examine potentially differing developmental patterns due to the learners' L1. Given the major role played by referents in manifesting topic continuity and discontinuity in discourse, the ways in which referents get introduced and maintained as topics were examined. Specifically, postpositional markers, zero anaphora, and the passive constructions were analyzed. The study revealed differing patterns in the acquisition of the management of referential topics between the Korean and English L1 groups. Previously unanswered issues regarding CLI within the field of SLA were addressed as follows: (1)&#xa0;Different acquisitional patterns between Korean and English learners were observed in the performance of some postpositional markers and in the morphological changes (passivization) of verbs. This offered new insights in CLI because interlanguage grammar has been considered to be an area of language in which CLI is rarely observed. Furthermore, different forms generated different ways in which CLI (both negative and positive transfer) was realized in the learner language. (2)&#xa0;Detailed qualitative analysis demonstrated how both NS and NNS manipulate form-function mapping while telling a story, and the form-function mapping skills developed with proficiency in the learner discourse. (3)&#xa0;Finally, the study expands upon the previous notion of conceptual transfer which was claimed to be found mainly on the level of lexicon or pragmatic realization. The current study identified conceptual transfer in the discourse-grammar interface. This part of the results reveals that the manner in which speakers ‘think for speaking’ (Slobin, 1991) in their L1 transferred to their L2 discourse.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/cross-linguistic-influence-on-development/docview/305329390/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nakamura, Michiko",2003.0,Processing of multiple filler -gap dependencies in Japanese,"Numerous studies have shown that in head-initial languages such as English, French, and German, relative clauses with a gap in the subject position (subject-gap relative clauses) are easier to process than relative clauses with a gap in the object position (object-gap relative clauses). One memory-based explanation for this subject-object gap asymmetry has been linear distance: a subject gap is linearly closer to the filler than an object gap, and thus fewer words need to be processed between the gap and its filler. This dissertation investigates the subject-object gap asymmetry in the processing of relative clauses in Japanese, a head-final language in which a relative clause precedes its head noun. In Japanese, an object gap is linearly closer than a subject gap to the filler. Therefore, the linear distance model predicts that object-gap relative clauses should be easier to process than subject-gap relative clauses. The results of two self-paced reading experiments showed that native speakers of Japanese found subject-gap relative clauses easier to process than object-gap relative clauses. At the head noun, this effect was modulated by the grammatical relation of the head noun. In following regions, however, the interaction disappeared and a consistent subject gap advantage emerged. A gap asymmetry was also found in relative clauses with two filler-gap dependencies. This construction involves global structural ambiguity in the dependencies between gaps and fillers. When semantic/pragmatic information strongly constrained the plausible thematic roles of fillers, the results of an offline survey and two self-paced reading experiments revealed a clear subject-object asymmetry: the distant filler was preferably associated with a subject gap over an object gap. When semantic/pragmatic information was weaker, processing became extremely difficult and showed no gap asymmetry. These findings are inconsistent with a linear distance account. It is proposed that the asymmetry is better accounted for by the structural distance between gap and filler: a subject gap is structurally closer to the filler, and thus it is computationally easier to form a dependency with. Structural distance as an alternative to account for both Japanese findings and the role of pragmatic information during processing is discussed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/processing-multiple-filler-gap-dependencies/docview/305326389/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

In one situation type, the power relationship was equal, the distance was small, and the degree of imposition was small (PDR-low). In the other situation type, the listener had greater power, the distance was large, and the degree of imposition was also large (PDR-high). The participants� production was analyzed for overall appropriateness (rated on a 6-point scale), planning time, and speech rate. Results showed that L2 learners produced PDR-low speech acts significantly more easily and quickly, but little difference was observed in native speakers� production. There was a significant proficiency effect on appropriateness ratings and speech rate, but not on planning time. Post hoc analyses showed that each group demonstrated different patterns in the choice of linguistic expressions over the two situation types, indicating the noteworthy impact of situational variation on oral speech act production.",,10.1093/APPLIN/AML051,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/AML051,ancestry
Naoko Taguchi,2008.0,"Cognition, Language Contact, and the Development of Pragmatic Comprehension in a Study‐Abroad Context","This study examined two issues: (a) whether there are gains in accurate and speedy comprehension of second language (L2) pragmatic meaning over time and (b) whether the gains are associated with cognitive processing ability and the amount of language contact in an L2 environment. Forty-four college students in a US institution completed three measures three times over a 4-month period: (a) the pragmatic listening test that measured the ability to comprehend implied speaker intentions, (b) the lexical access test that measured ability to make speedy semantic judgment, and (c) the language contact survey that examined the amount of time learners spent in L2 outside the class. The learners' pragmatic comprehension was analyzed for accuracy (the scores on the pragmatic listening test) and comprehension speed (the average time taken to answer items correctly). Results showed that the learners made significant improvement on comprehension speed but not on accuracy of comprehension. Lexical access speed was significantly correlated with comprehension speed but not with accuracy. The amount of speaking and reading outside class that the students reported on the language contact survey significantly correlated with the gains in comprehension speed but not with accuracy of comprehension.",,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00434.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00434.X,ancestry
Naoko Taguchi,2008.0,THE ROLE OF LEARNING ENVIRONMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRAGMATIC COMPREHENSION,"This study examines the role of environment in the development of pragmatic comprehension. It tracks two groups of Japanese students of English: 60 students in a college in Japan (English as a foreign language [EFL] learners) and 57 students in a college in the United States (English as a second language [ESL] learners). The learners completed a computerized listening task that measured their ability to comprehend two types of implied meaning: indirect refusals (k = 24) and indirect opinions (k = 24). The task was given to each group twice, before and after the students received approximately 120–130 hr of classroom instruction. Comprehension was analyzed for accuracy (scores) and speed (average time taken to answer each item correctly). Results showed that, in both learner groups, accuracy and comprehension speed improved significantly over time. For the EFL group, the magnitude of effect was much less for speed than for accuracy. In contrast, ESL learners showed significant improvement in comprehension speed, with a sizable effect size, but only marginal improvement in accuracy.",,10.1017/S0272263108080716,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263108080716,ancestry

"Narita, Ritsuko",2009.0,The Effects of Pragmatic Consciousness-Raising Activities on the Development of Pragmatic Awareness and Use of Hearsay Evidential Markers for Learners of Japanese as a Foreign Language,"The present study investigates the effectiveness of pragmatic consciousness-raising (PCR) activities in the L2 pragmatic acquisition of hearsay evidential markers by learners of Japanese as a foreign language (JFL). PCR is essentially an inductive approach to facilitating awareness of how language forms are used appropriately in a given context. Regarding consciousness-raising, Schmidt (1990, 1993, 1994, 1995, 2001) has proposed his noticing hypothesis that no learning can occur without awareness. Therefore, the study explores the question of whether there can be learning without awareness. A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest format (immediate and delayed) was adopted. Forty-one JFL learners participated in this study. They were undergraduate and graduate students in the US. The JFL learners were divided into two groups: the PCR treatment group and the control group. The pretests were administered one day prior to the treatment sessions. The tests consist of two metapragmatic knowledge tests and an oral discourse production test. In total, four experimental sessions (30 minutes per session) were given to the PCR group. During the treatment sessions, the JFL learners in the PCR group first compared hearsay reports in L1 English and L1 Japanese, and then compared hearsay reports in L1 Japanese and L2 Japanese. After the treatment periods were over, the learners in both groups were asked to complete immediate posttests. Lastly, one month after the treatment sessions, both groups took delayed posttests. The JFL learners in the PCR activities performed both the immediate posttests and the delayed posttests better than the control group. These results indicate that it may be effective for JFL learners to learn the features of hearsay evidential markers in Japanese through discourse analysis and become able to use hearsay expressions in a native Japanese-like manner. With regard to the feedback from the PCR participants, some students provided positive feedback on the analysis exercises using natural discourse data. They commented that it is always good to read more real examples that do not come from a textbook. Through the PCR activities, L2 learners may be made aware of critical differences between L1 and L2 pragmatics.

"Nassajizavareh, Hossein",1998.0,A component skills approach to adult ESL reading: Evidence from native speakers of Farsi,"The role of basic language processing components, in general, and that of lower-level phonological and orthographic processing skills, in particular, is not well understood in second language reading. Most research in second and foreign language (L2) reading has followed top-down models, focusing almost exclusively on the role of higher-level processes such as background knowledge and the knowledge of syntactic and semantic structures in processing text. Therefore, the lower-level dimensions of text, particularly phonological and orthographic processes, have not received attention relative to more top-down processes. The present study addressed this gap in current knowledge by investigating basic language processing skills in adult English as a second language (ESL) readers who were native speakers of Farsi. Measures of lower-level phonological and orthographic processing skills in conjunction with higher-level syntactic and semantic processing skills were used while controlling for aspects of cognitive ability relevant to reading such as working memory and speed of lexical access. Participants were 60 advanced ESL readers (all adult native speakers of Farsi residing in Canada). Three measures of reading were criterion variables: reading comprehension, silent reading rate, and the ability to recognize individual words out of context. Data were analyzed using correlations and hierarchical multiple regressions. Correlational analyses revealed that both speed and accuracy on second language phonological, orthographic, syntactic, and semantic measures correlated significantly with each other and with various indices of ESL reading proficiency. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that efficiency in phonological and orthographic processing contributed to the prediction of individual differences on the reading measures. In particular, efficiency in orthographic processing contributed unique variance to the reading measures over and above the variance contributed by higher level syntactic and semantic skills. The results challenge the common assumption in L2 that the availability of higher-level processes in L2 reading comprehension reduces significantly the contribution of lower-level processes. They also challenge the idea that proficient L2 readers, that is, those with a basic command of L2 vocabulary, syntax, and discourse markers, move away from using lower-level skills and rely instead on higher-level semantic and syntactic skins. Rather, the results indicate that in addition to more general language proficiency indices such as semantic and syntactic knowledge, individual differences In ESL reading need to be understood in respect to individual differences in lower-level processes, particularly, the efficiency with which readers process phonological and orthographic information. The role of these processes should not be overlooked in ESL reading even when readers are proficient adult L2 readers.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/component-skills-approach-adult-esl-reading/docview/304477501/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Navarro Ortega, Samuel A.",2007.0,The acquisition of motion event descriptions in L2 Spanish,"The present study is a cross-sectional investigation into the acquisition of the conceptual framework underlying the description of motion events in Spanish. Motion is a category of human cognition which is expressed differently in English and in Spanish, making motion an interesting area of investigation in a study of the acquisition of Spanish by English speakers. While English speakers tend to use manner verbs in sentences for specific descriptions of motion (e.g., run ), Spanish speakers tend to use path verbs in sentences for less specific descriptions of motion (e.g., go ). The participants for this study were sixty English speakers studying Spanish at three levels of proficiency (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and a group of twenty native speakers of Spanish. The English speakers were tested for their preferences in written motion descriptions in Spanish and English (the receptive task). They were also tested for their use of motion verbs in spontaneous connected speech (the production task), also in Spanish and English. Results showed that, in the receptive task, all English-speaking learners chose higher percentages of manner than path descriptions in English, but only the advanced learners showed a preference for higher percentages of path descriptions in Spanish compared with manner descriptions. In the production task, all learners talked about motion using higher percentages of path verbs. However, highest token frequencies revealed important differences in the way learners talked about motion in Spanish. For example, the advanced learners, like the Spanish native speakers, favoured an exiting-going-returning verb sequence. By contrast, the beginner and intermediate learners produced a more English-like verb sequence of going-coming , without any reference to motion in relation to a bounded area. The study demonstrated that the acquisition of motion event descriptions was a slow process in which the beginners as well as the intermediate learners relied on first-language knowledge in the receptive and production tasks in Spanish, their second language. It was only after extensive exposure to the second language, higher levels of proficiency, and numerous instances of thinking and speaking in Spanish that the advanced learners conceptualized and expressed motion in ways which resembled more the target-language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-motion-event-descriptions-l2-spanish/docview/304791027/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Nguyen, Minh Thi Thuy",2005.0,Criticizing and responding to criticism in a foreign language: A study of Vietnamese learners of English,"Interlanguage pragmatics research has contributed a great deal to our understanding of L2 pragmatic use but less to our understanding of L2 pragmatic development, although developmental issues are also its primary research goal. Additionally, previous studies have been confined to a rather small set of speech acts, under-researching such face-damaging acts as criticizing and responding to criticism even though these may be more challenging for L2 learners. The present study examines pragmatic development in the use of criticizing and responding to criticism by a group of Vietnamese EFL learners with a view to shedding light on the pragmatic properties of these speech acts. IL data were collected from 12 high beginners, 12 intermediate learners, and 12 advanced learners, via a written questionnaire and role play, and analyzed with reference to L1 and L2 baseline data collected from 12 Vietnamese and 12 Australian NSs via the same methods. Metapragmatic data were collected via retrospective interview. Four main findings are discussed. Firstly, the learners criticized and responded to criticism very differently from the NSs. This difference might have adversely affected how the learners negotiated their intentions expressed via speech act realizations. Secondly, there was little evidence of any proficiency effect on the learners' use of these two speech acts. This was probably because pragmatic development was limited by the EFL context, as the learners had had insufficient exposure to the target norms. Thirdly, there was evidence of pragmatic transfer in the learners' production. This transfer was affected by the learners' perception of L1-L2 proximity and assumption of L2 reasonableness. Finally, the retrospective interviews with learners suggested four main sources of influence on their pragmatic decision-making: insufficient L2 pragmatic knowledge, transfer of communication and learning, processing difficulty, and learning experience. The present study lends support to a number of SLA theories, including Bialystoks' processing model and Meisel et al. 's complexification hypothesis. It found that the major challenge for learners in L2 pragmatic acquisition is to gain control over processing. It also found an acquisitional order of modality markers which was dependent upon their structural complexity and the processing demands involved in producing them.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/criticizing-responding-criticism-foreign-language/docview/305392196/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Nigel G. Ward, Rafael Escalante, Yaffa Al Bayyari, T. Solorio",2007.0,Learning to show you're listening,"Good listeners generally produce back-channel feedback, that is, short utterances such as uh-huh which signal active listening. As the rules governing back-channeling vary from language to language, second-language learners may need help acquiring this skill. This paper is an initial exploration of how to provide this. It presents a training sequence which enables learners to acquire a basic Arabic back-channel skill, namely, that of producing feedback immediately after the speaker produces a syllable or two with a sharply falling pitch. This training sequence includes an explanation, audio examples, the use of visual signals to highlight occurrences of this pitch downslope, auditory and visual feedback on learners' attempts to produce the cue themselves, and feedback on the learners' performance as they play the role of an attentive listener in response to one side of a pre-recorded dialog. Experiments show that this enables learners to better approximate proper Arabic back-channeling behavior.",,10.1080/09588220701745825,https://doi.org/10.1080/09588220701745825,ancestry

"Nishimura, Yukiko",2008.0,Aspects of Japanese computer-mediated communication: Linguistic and socio-cultural perspectives,"This study discusses Japanese computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically focusing on messages sent to open-access bulletin board system (BBS) websites. It first compares quantitatively CMC language with speech and writing and finds that interjections distinguish speech from CMC and writing. CMC is distinguished from writing by uses of particles. Uses of auxiliary verbs separate the two target websites, Channel 2 and Yahoo within CMC. Based on the linguistic characterisation of the CMC language, the thesis further discusses qualitatively politeness and impoliteness behaviours in the two target BBS websites with contrasting linguistic features. This study points out that one theory of politeness proposed by Brown and Levinson (1987) can explain impolite behaviour in Channel 2, but not politeness in Yahoo, and that another theoiy proposed by Ide (1989) can explain polite behaviour in Yahoo, but not impoliteness in Channel 2. A third theory from a discursive approach proposed by Locher and Watts (2005) is shown to be capable of synthesising the two contrasting situations. In the following chapters, concepts of online community are employed to discuss politeness issues in conjunction with the sense of community. Here differences in discussion topics are found to be relevant to both the sense of community and linguistic choices of polite/impolite language, across the two target websites. Seemingly impolite behaviour in Channel 2, where users have a strong sense of community can be explained by the concept of contextual appropriateness by Watts. Underlying the topics specifically addressed in the thesis, this study also identifies the greater role played by technology in Japanese CMC than in English CMC. It fills a research gap in linguistic study on CMC language in Japanese, politeness and impoliteness research in online context as well as online community studies in Japanese cultural contexts. It is expected to contribute to understanding Japanese CMC linguistically and socio-culturally, as well as politeness and impoliteness and online community research in general.x", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/aspects-japanese-computer-mediated-communication/docview/1973936794/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
Noriko Iwashita,2003.0,NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND POSITIVE EVIDENCE IN TASK-BASED INTERACTION,"This study examines the role of task-based conversation in second language (L2) grammatical development, focusing on the short-term effects of both negative feedback and positive evidence on the acquisition of two Japanese structures. The data are drawn from 55 L2 learners of Japanese at a beginning level of proficiency in an Australian tertiary institution. Five different types of interactional moves made by native speaker interlocutors during task-based interaction were identified, by way of which learners received implicit negative feedback and positive evidence about the two target structures. The relative frequency of each interactional move type was calculated, and associated changes in the learners' performance on immediate and delayed posttests were examined. It was found that, although native speaker interactional moves containing positive evidence about the two target structures were 10 times more frequent during task-based language learning than those containing implicit negative feedback, only learners who had an above-average score on the pretest benefited from the positive evidence provided. Implicit negative feedback, on the other hand, had beneficial effects on short-term development of the grammatical targets regardless of the learner's current mastery of the target structures. Moreover, recasts were found to have a larger impact than other conversational moves on short-term L2 grammatical development.",,10.1017/S0272263103000019,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263103000019,ancestry

"Numata, Mitsuko",2009.0,The effects of the use of communication and negotiation strategies on L2 acquisition,"L2 learner's use of communication strategies (CSs) has received an attention since 1970s (Faech &amp; Kasper, 1983; Tarone et al., 1983). Previous studies have focused on identification and classification of CSs, the effectiveness and teachability of CS, the uses of CSs by different proficiency levels in different tasks, and individual differences in CS use. In spite of the varieties in focus of the previous researches, no research has address whether the use of CSs affects L2 acquisition over and beyond the level of sustainment of communication. Recent studies in classroom acquisition have shown beneficial effects of negotiation during peer conversation on L2 grammar acquisition. However, previous studies in peer interaction focus primarily on how a listener's negotiation move or corrective feedback helps a speaker to repair his/her erroneous utterances. One the other hand, CS research concerns with a speaker's voluntary action to make him/her understood at the time of communication difficulty. In other words, both negotiation strategies and CSs occur in the same conversational context. Even so, no research has ever investigated the relationship between them. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationship between the use of CSs and negotiation strategies on L2 acquisition. Twenty four students enrolled in the intermediate and advance Japanese language courses are asked to engage in two types of communicative tasks, and their development of vocabulary and grammar knowledge are examined through pre- and posttests of the target linguistic items. Also, conversations during the tasks are transcribed and qualitatively analyzed to examine the pattern of CS use and the rate of successful repair moves. The results indicate that some CSs such as appeals and code switching are beneficial, with or without a negotiation move from the interlocutor, but others may be detrimental to L2 development.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-use-communication-negotiation-strategies/docview/304903985/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"O'Donnell, Mary E.",2005.0,Use of textual elaboration with literary texts in intermediate Spanish,"The purpose of this study was to analyze textual elaboration as a modification option for literary texts in an intermediate Spanish language course. This study suggests that literary texts might obtain a more predominant place in second language instruction, especially for readers with lower levels of language proficiency, if learners were supplied with additional tools to facilitate comprehension. Elaboration is one of these tools that could ease comprehension difficulty that occur due to as text failure; that is, the difficulties readers encounter when the text's structure is so obtuse or unfamiliar to the reader. Here, readers' response to textual elaboration was tested and measured. Readers' comprehension was assessed via three instruments: (a)&#xa0;a recall protocol, (b)&#xa0;multiple-choice questions and (c)&#xa0;short constructed response questions. The study findings indicate that elaborative modifications to literary texts influence the amount and kind of information that intermediate-level Spanish learners comprehend about the texts. Limited-proficiency L2 readers of short literary texts that have been modified elaboratively can recall more information about the texts and are able to identify more vocabulary that appeared within the text. They cannot, however, infer meaning from these texts to a greater degree than the readers of unmodified versions of the same texts. Moreover, level of text difficult plays a pivotal role in relations to the effectiveness of elaborative modifications. In term of comprehension, students who read unmodified texts that are relatively easy to comprehend benefit the least from elaborative modifications.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/use-textual-elaboration-with-literary-texts/docview/304988338/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Odlin, Terence",2005.0,CROSSLINGUISTIC INFLUENCE AND CONCEPTUAL TRANSFER: WHAT ARE THE CONCEPTS?,"This chapter surveys recent work on language transfer and focuses on the intersection of second language acquisition (SLA) and linguistic relativity in what is often termed conceptual transfer. The two most famous exponents of relativity, Wilhelm von Humboldt and Benjamin Lee Whorf, developed their ideas largely from their study of Kawi and Hopi respectively, and both scholars viewed crosslinguistic influence as a manifestation of the ""binding power"" (to use Whorf's characterization) of language on thought. The views of von Humboldt and Whorf diverge in some ways, and the difference is relevant not only to issues in SLA such as ultimate attainment but also to theories of linguistic relativity. Indeed, some recent work on conceptual transfer indicates that even highly proficient learners may never free themselves entirely of the ""binding power"" of L1. The research reviewed also includes work with native speakers of different languages, suggesting real cognitive differences related to language in, for example, spatial concepts. The importance of distinguishing concepts from meanings is emphasized, as is the difference between meaning transfer and conceptual transfer. The chapter discusses in detail research on transfer involving spatial, temporal, and affective meanings, with some of the studies being interpreted as evidence of conceptual transfer.

"Ohashi, Jun",2009.0,Natural Conversation Reconstruction Tasks: The Language Classroom as a Meeting Place,"This paper, drawing on Pratt’s notion of ‘transculturation’ and Bhabha’s ‘third space’, presents an example of language learning tasks that empower learners’ agency and promote their cross-cultural awareness and sensitivities to a different set of cultural expectations, using a naturally occurred Japanese thanking episodes. The paper discusses the merits of Natural Conversation Reconstruction Tasks (NCRTs) as a practical method for helping L2 learners develop this ‘intercultural competence’. It is based on a qualitative study of the results of one NCRT created for use in the context of teaching Japanese as a L2 in a multicultural society. It suggests the NCRT encourages the learners to explore the intersection where language use, speaker intention and L1 and L2 cultural norms meet. Such a process helps the learners become aware of socially expected patterns of communication in L1 and L2 in terms of the choices of speech act, formulaic expressions, sequential organization and politeness orientation. The learners’ comments suggest that the NCRT helps learners transcend their cultural boundaries by overcoming their narrow understanding of ‘thanking’ as ‘expressions of gratitude and appreciation’ and by cross-culturally widening their views of what counts as thanking. The NCRT with rich contextual information promotes the learners’ intercultural awareness, sensitivity to context and intercultural exploration in the space between L1 and L2, where they have authority and freedom of making sense of conversations, and pragmatics is fully integrated into language pedagogy.", Journal Article,10.5130/portal.v6i1.851,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/natural-conversation-reconstruction-tasks/docview/2201501903/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

This article critically reviews five major accounts proposed in the literature, namely: * transfer of a compound tense/aspect structure in the learner's first language (L1); * overgeneralization of adjectival passive formation in English; * nontarget lexical causativization; * identification of the passive morphosyntax with the lack of a logical subject; and * nontarget overt marking of syntactic NP movement. By analysing each account in terms of its ramifications in light of the data already available in the literature and additional data from a large corpus of nonnative English, I demonstrate that the most plausible account of the 'passive' unaccusative structure is to regard it as an overt marker of NP movement, an overgeneralization of the passive morphosyntax of the target English.", Original article,10.1177/026765830001600401,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/what-is-happened-may-not-be-appears-happening/docview/200252423/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Oshita, Hiroyuki",2001.0,THE UNACCUSATIVE TRAP IN SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION,"The distinction of two types of intransitive verbs--unergatives (with underlying subjects) and unaccusatives (with underlying objects)--may not exist at early stages of L2 acquisition, both being syntactically represented as unergatives. This idea, referred to here as the Unaccusative Trap Hypothesis, provides an elegant developmental account for a variety of seemingly unrelated syntactic phenomena in L2 English, Japanese, and Chinese. Target language input, structural constraints on natural language linking rules, and linguistic properties of a learner's L1s shape stages in the reorganization of the lexical and syntactic components of interlanguage grammars. Although nonnative grammars may initially override the structural constraints postulated as the Unaccusative Hypothesis (Burzio, 1986; Perlmutter, 1978) and the Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (Baker, 1988), at later developmental stages some may still achieve conformity with the norms of natural languages.

"Ostapenko, Olesya",2008.0,The acquisition of multiple <i>wh</i>-questions in Russian as a foreign language,"This dissertation investigates the nature of interlanguage (IL) grammars L1 English speakers construct when faced with L2 Russian multiple wh -questions. The L1 English and the L2 Russian differ in the range of permissible wh -questions as well as the order of wh -elements in a sentence to a great extent. Whereas only one wh -word is fronted in English, in Russian multiple wh -questions, all wh -words have to move to at least preverbal position. In addition, in contrast to English, Russian has no constraints on the order of wh -words in the sentence relative to each other. Different ordering of wh -words, in turn, results in a distinction in presupposition and focus. The data are collected from advanced English-speaking learners of Russian in three tasks addressing separate issues. In experiment 1 the subjects are to construct all possible grammatical multiple wh -questions out of set of cards each of which contains one word. In the next task the subjects are to rate the acceptability of given sentences thus providing insight into their intuitions about grammaticality of L2 Russian multiple wh -questions. The last exercise tests whether L2 learners are able to grasp the pragmatic differences in questions expressed by the order of wh -elements. The results demonstrate that IL grammars exhibit both L1-English- and L2-Russian-like multiple wh -questions. IL grammars also demonstrate patterns that are attributable to neither English nor Russian but are characteristic of other primary languages. The difference in presupposition and focus is grasped but not in a target-like manner.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-multiple-i-wh-questions-russian-as/docview/304459117/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Ozeki, Hiromi;Shirai, Yasuhiro",2007.0,DOES THE NOUN PHRASE ACCESSIBILITY HIERARCHY PREDICT THE DIFFICULTY ORDER IN THE ACQUISITION OF JAPANESE RELATIVE CLAUSES?,"Although Keenan and Comrie's (1977) noun phrase accessibility hierarchy (NPAH) has been shown to predict the difficulty order of relative clauses (RCs) in SLA, most studies of the NPAH have been on European languages. This paper tests the prediction for Japanese. Study 1 analyzes RCs in an oral interview corpus from 90 learners of Japanese at four different levels of proficiency (first language = Mandarin Chinese, English, and Korean; N = 30 for each). Analysis of 1005 RCs from nonnative data and 231 RCs from 15 native speakers (NSs) of Japanese revealed that even lower proficiency learners used direct object (DO) and oblique (OBL) relatives, suggesting that subject (SU) relatives are not easier than DO or OBL relatives for second language learners of Japanese. The learners (except Korean NSs) also made strong associations between SU and animate heads and between DO/OBL and inanimate heads. Study 2 employed a sentence-combining experiment. Fifty NSs of Cantonese studying Japanese in Hong Kong took the test, which controlled for the animacy of head noun phrases and arguments of the verbs. Results revealed no significant difference between SU and DO, which were both easier than OBL, with only a minimal effect of animacy. However, errors of converting DO and OBL target items into SU relatives almost exclusively involved animate-head items. The results suggest that the NPAH does not predict the difficulty order of Japanese RCs, and that learners use different types of RCs based on the animacy of the head noun.

P. Robinson,1995.0,"Attention, Memory, and the “Noticing” Hypothesis","Schmidt (1990) claimed that consciousness, in the sense of awareness of the form of input at the level of “noticing”, is necessary to subsequent second language acquisition (SLA). This claim runs counter to Krashen's (1981) dualsystem hypothesis that SLA largely results from an unconscious “acquisition” system, the contribution of the conscious “learning” system to SLA being limited and peripheral. Important to a theory of SLA that allows a central role to the act of noticing is a specification of the nature of the attentional mechanisms involved, and of their relationship to current models of the organization of memory. With this in mind the present paper reviews current research into the nature of attention and memory and proposes a model of the relationship between them during SLA that, it is argued, is complementary to Schmidt's noticing hypothesis and oppositional to the dual-system hypothesis of Krashen. In light of this model, I argue that differential performance on implicit and explicit learning and memory experiments is caused by differences in the consciously regulated processing demands of training tasks and not by the activation of consciously and unconsciously accessed systems. I also argue that the attentional demands of pedagogical tasks and individual differences in memory and attentional capacity both affect the extent of noticing, thereby directly influencing SLA.",,10.1111/J.1467-1770.1995.TB00441.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-1770.1995.TB00441.X,ancestry

Its origins within communicative language teaching and second language acquisition research are sketched, and the notion of a task in language learning is defined. There is also brief coverage of the different and sometimes contrasting groups who are interested in the use of tasks. The second section surveys research into tasks, covering the different perspectives (interactional, cognitive) which have been influential. Then a third section explores how performance on tasks has been measured, generally in terms of how complex the language used is, how accurate it is, and how fluent. There is also discussion of approaches to measuring interaction. A fourth section explores the pedagogic and interventionist dimension of the use of tasks. The article concludes with a survey of the various critiques of tasks that have been made in recent years.",,10.1017/S026144480200188X,https://doi.org/10.1017/S026144480200188X,ancestry

"Park, Kyae-Sung",2005.0,L2 acquisition of English unaccusative verbs by native speakers of Korean,"This experimental study explores the learnability problems involved in the acquisition of English unaccusative verbs by Korean L2 learners using a production and two grammaticality judgment tasks. The results showed that learners tended to overpassivize unaccusatives. Due to the poor performance on resultatives and pseudopassives with unergatives, it was found that very few could make the unergative/unaccusative distinction. On the other hand, learners correctly performed on those with unaccusatives, which suggests that they had knowledge of syntactic properties of unaccusativity at D-Structure. Overpassivization errors indicate that L1 transfer occurred at the morphological level, and that learners had an innate knowledge in mapping semantic roles onto syntactic functions. That is, they relied on the canonical mapping, agent to subject and theme to object. In conclusion, although L1 plays a crucial role in the L2 acquisition of English unaccusative verbs by native speakers of Korean, a UG-related mechanism is also involved.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-acquisition-english-unaccusative-verbs-native/docview/305427591/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Paula Garcia,2004.0,Developmental Differences in Speech Act Recognition: A Pragmatic Awareness Study,"With the growing acknowledgement of the importance of pragmatic competence in second language (L2) learning, language researchers have identified the comprehension of speech acts as they occur in natural conversation as essential to communicative competence (e.g. Bardovi-Harlig, 2001; Thomas, 1983). Nonconventional indirect speech acts are formed in a variety of ways by native English speakers and are therefore not easily recognised by non-native English speakers (Cook & Liddicoat, 2002; Kasper, 1984). In order to investigate this aspect of pragmatic comprehension, this study compared the pragmatic awareness of low and high ability L2 learners and native English speakers by examining each group's ability to recognise indirect speech acts as they occurred in a corpus of conversations taking place in academic settings. Participants (n = 56) identified requests, suggestions, corrections, and offers with varying success. Results show that contextual knowledge and linguistic features, such as specified agent, lexical markers, false starts, and use of modals, may have interacted with speech act type to account for performance variability. This information can be used by language teachers to raise English language learners' awareness of how pragmatic meaning is conveyed.",,10.1080/09658410408667089,https://doi.org/10.1080/09658410408667089,forward

"Peng, Szu-Yuan",2008.0,"Globalism, self-identity, and motivation perceptions of Taiwanese majors in Japanese language and culture","The purpose of this study was to explore how freshman and junior students majoring in Japanese language and culture at Soochow University in Taipei, Taiwan, perceived the influences of a global view on their self-identity, ethnicity, social networks, and the place of Japan in the global society. The study survey focuses on levels of motivation to study Japanese as well as perceptions of how the world is changing. The study survey also explores perceptions of how selection of Japanese as foreign language study may relate to students' self-identity as global citizens. The study may have value to a wide variety of educators and language faculty who are interested in the emerging phenomenon of global self-identity related to motivation for multilingualism and broad cultural interfacing. Research in educational psychology has suggested that students' motivation is closely related to their self-beliefs concerning their ability and how teachers structure their classrooms. Therefore, this study investigated Taiwanese young adults' attitudes and motivation toward the major in Japanese language and the influence of globalism on motivation to study the language. This study combined both qualitative and quantitative methods to examine students' perceptions. Computation of survey item responses into composite mean scores were calculated to identify independent sample t tests on students' perspectives regarding self-identity, global world view, personality preferences, and motivation types. In general, respondents showed interest in discussing their self-identities in a global context, saw the study of Japanese language and culture as empowering them to be global citizens with enhanced resources to get good jobs and social respect, and perceived Mandarin as potentially the future dominant global language, even over English. In line with previous research, this study found that the young adult respondents were more motivated instrumentally than integratively, using Gardner's model. But, respondents were enthusiastic to be interviewed about more abstract or integrative aspects of membership in a global society. The study concluded that foreign language faculty may find an enthusiastic and willing audience for dialogue, beyond study of language mechanics and vocabulary, among young adults who are metacognitively increasingly aware of their need to be part of emerging globalism.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/globalism-self-identity-motivation-perceptions/docview/288454223/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Philips, Mieko Kimura",1998.0,"Discourse markers in Japanese: Connectives, fillers, and interactional particles","This dissertation analyzes the functions of Japanese connectives, fillers, and interactional particles as discourse markers used by native and normative speakers of Japanese, using Schiffrin's (1987) framework. Quantitative analysis of these markers in relation to sociolinguistic factors is also presented. Schiffrin analyzes 11 English discourse markers using the discourse model she proposes, consisting of five planes of talk: the ideational, exchange and action structures, the participation framework, and the information state. She argues that with their indexical functions, English discourse markers provide textual and participant coordinates for an utterance, elucidating its relationship to prior and/or upcoming utterances, or to the interlocutors. Based upon the naturally occurring speech data, I argue that Japanese connectives, fillers, and interactional particles operate in much the same way as English discourse markers. Discourse markers are indispensable part of Japanese conversation with their functions as utterance-initial, utterance-medial and utterance-final brackets of units of talk. The connective de 'and', for example, functions as a textual coordinate, connecting utterances which are in a sequential or cause-effect relationship. It also functions as a marker of speaker continuation. Fillers not only function as pause-filling devices but also display the speaker's thoughts and feelings, such as uncertainty and hesitation. Interactional particles also reveal the speaker's feelings or attitude towards a proposition and/or the hearer. My data suggest that the speaker's gender and speech genre are the most significant factor in the use of connectives. In the use of fillers, formality is the most significant factor. Formality and speech genre are most significantly related to the use of interactional particles. As regards the use of Japanese discourse markers by non-native speakers, it was found that: (1) their proficiency level and the length of formal study are the two most significant factors in their discourse marker usage, and (2) when a marker has both referential and interactional functions, the former are learned before the latter. Finally, I propose that, given their importance in natural conversation, the roles and use of discourse markers be consciously taught in Japanese language classrooms.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/discourse-markers-japanese-connectives-fillers/docview/304433430/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Philp, Jenefer",2003.0,"CONSTRAINTS ON ""NOTICING THE GAP"": NONNATIVE SPEAKERS' NOTICING OF RECASTS IN NS-NNS INTERACTION","Interaction has been argued to promote noticing of L2 form in a context crucial to learning--when there is a mismatch between the input and the learner's interlanguage (IL) grammar (Gass &amp; Varonis, 1994; Long, 1996; Pica, 1994). This paper investigates the extent to which learners may notice native speakers' reformulations of their IL grammar in the context of dyadic interaction. Thirty-three adult ESL learners worked on oral communication tasks in NS-NNS pairs. During each of the five sessions of dyadic task-based interaction, learners received recasts of their nontargetlike question forms. Accurate immediate recall of recasts was taken as evidence of noticing of recasts by learners. Results indicate that learners noticed over 60-70% of recasts. However, accurate recall was constrained by the level of the learner and by the length and number of changes in the recast. The effect of these variables on noticing is discussed in terms of processing biases. It is suggested that attentional resources and processing biases of the learner may modulate the extent to which learners ""notice the gap"" between their nontargetlike utterances and recasts.

Issues concerning intelligibility are a key focus of this investigation, particularly as native speaker models have limited relevance to these new contexts of use. This review highlights current research from diverse areas of applied linguistics that have addressed aspects of intelligibility in both experimental and real-world settings. Current findings suggest that the processes by which understanding is achieved in English as a lingua franca (ELF) interaction are qualitatively different from those observed in native speaker (NS)-based interaction, and that this has implications for a number of research and practice areas. Following a definition of terms, the chapter surveys current research and considers its influence on current trends in English language teaching.

Implicit-inductive learning was implemented by pairing sentences with color pictures; explicit-deductive learning was implemented by means of traditional grammar rule presentation, followed by picture-sentence pairing.

Sixty-one subjects were taught four morphosyntactic rules and 32 vocabulary items in an artificial language. After they had reached criterion on a set of metalinguistic tests of grammar and vocabulary, they engaged in systematic, computer-controlled comprehension and production practice for 8 weeks. Comprehension practice consisted of choosing between pictures displayed on the computer screen to match a sentence; production practice consisted of typing the correct sentence corresponding to a picture. All subjects were taught the same rules and then practiced them, and all subjects had the same amount of comprehension and production practice, but which rules were practiced in comprehension and which in production varied between groups. Results show that the learning of morphosyntactic rules is highly skill-specific and that these skills develop very gradually over time, following the same power function learning curve as the acquisition of other cognitive skills. These results are consistent with current skill acquisition theory.",,10.1017/S0272263197002040,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263197002040,ancestry
R. Dekeyser,2001.0,Cognition and Second Language Instruction: Automaticity and automatization,"Introduction: concepts and issues In a very general sense, everybody knows what automaticity means. Some doors slide open automatically, some cars shift gears automatically, some VCRs rewind automatically; in other words these objects perform their functions without requiring any physical or mental effort on our part (the meaning of the Greek adjective automatos is selfacting). In the psychological sense, every layman has had experience with automaticity too. When typing, driving a stick-shift car or using a word-processor too edit a text, we perform a complex series of tasks very quickly and efficiently, without having to think about the various components and subcomponents of action involved; sometimes we are even unable to think of them explicitly, and therefore we may have trouble visualizing the keyboard or explaining to somebody else how to use a piece of software, even though – or rather just because – we use the keyboard or the software with great ease. Initially, though, we may have found typing, driving a stick-shift car or using a spreadsheet to be slow, tricky, and tiring. The automaticity, that is the speed and ease with which we ultimately carry out these tasks, is the result of a slow process that we call automatization. Once this process has run its course, the chain of actions involved in the automatized tasks can even become hard to suppress, as we experience when forced to shift from a querty to an azerty keyboard, from a stick-shift to an automatic car, or from one kind of accounting software to another.",,10.1017/CBO9781139524780.007,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139524780.007,ancestry

It is less clear, however, whether the kind of communication that occurs in a classroom is sufficient to ensure development of full target language competence. This article examines the extent to which the opportunities for communication in an English as a Second Language (ESL) classroom result in the acquisition of one particular illocutionary act—requests. A total of 410 requests produced by two child learners over 15–21 months were examined. The results suggest that although considerable development took place over this period, both learners failed to develop either the full range of request types or a broad linguistic repertoire for performing those types that they did acquire. The learners also failed to develop the sociolinguistic competence needed to vary their choice of request to take account of different addressees. One explanation for these results is that although the classroom context fostered interpersonal and expressive needs in the two learners, it did not provide the conditions for real sociolinguistic needs.",,10.1017/S0272263100010445,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263100010445,ancestry
R. Ellis,2000.0,Task-based research and language pedagogy,"Two very different theoretical accounts of task-based language use and learning are critiqued and their relevance for language pedagogy discussed. One account, which will be referred to as the psycholinguistic perspective, draws on a computational model of second language (L2) acquisition (Lantolf, 1996). According to this perspective, tasks are viewed as devices that provide learners with the data they need for learning; the design of a task is seen as potentially determining the kind of language use and opportunities for learning that arise.Three different psycholinguistic models are discussed: Long’s Interaction Hypothesis, Skehan’s ‘cognitive approach’ and Yule’s framework of communicative efficiency. The second theoretical account of tasks is that provided by socio-cultural theory. This is premised on the claim that participants co-construct the ‘activity’ they engage in when performing a task, in accordance with their own socio-history and locally determined goals, and that, therefore, it is difficult to make reliable predictions regarding the kinds of language use and opportunities for learning that will arise. Socio-cultural theory emphasizes the dialogic processes (such as ‘scaffolding’) that arise in a task performance and how these shape language use and learning. Both theoretical approaches afford insights that are of value to task-based language pedagogy. The psycholinguistic approach provides information that is of importance for planning task-based teaching and learning. The socio-cultural approach illuminates the kinds of improvisation that teachers and learners need to engage in during task-based activity to promote communicative efficiency and L2 acquisition.",,10.1177/136216880000400302,https://doi.org/10.1177/136216880000400302,ancestry

How does it differ from other constructs such as L2 proficiency and language aptitude? Second, the article considers how L2 explicit knowledge can be measured. It critically reviews some of the ways in which explicit knowledge has been operationalized in second language acquisition research and discusses some of the instruments that have been used to measure L2 explicit knowledge.

R. Leow,2007.0,Practice in a Second Language: Input in the L2 classroom: An attentional perspective on receptive practice,"Introduction The role of input is undoubtedly crucial in the process of second/foreign language (L2) learning. Input may be defined as the L2 data (form-based and/or meaning-based) that learners receive either in the formal classroom or in a naturalistic setting. Indeed, how L2 input is presented to L2 learners in the classroom and its effects on the processes learners employ to interact with the input (input processing) have been the focus of several strands of second language acquisition (SLA) studies conducted within a psycholinguistic framework. The theoretical underpinnings of most of these psycholinguistic studies appear to include some role for attention (and possibly awareness) in the processing of L2 grammatical or linguistic data in adult learners' L2 development (e.g., Robinson, 1995; Schmidt, 1990, 1993, 1995, 2001; Tomlin & Villa, 1994; VanPatten, 2004). The term practice has several connotations (see DeKeyser, this volume for an elaborated discussion of this term in several fields of inquiry) in both the applied linguistics and cognitive psychology literatures. In applied linguistics, the notion of pedagogical practice in the typical classroom assumes some form of performance by learners in response to L2 grammatical input they receive in this setting, which may be provided prior to or during practice. In addition, the L2 input is usually manipulated in some form by the teacher. For example, learners may be exposed to L2 that has been carefully selected and manipulated by the teacher to highlight some linguistic data and may be requested to interact with it in several ways, such as selecting options related to the linguistic data in the input, performing a task, and so forth.",,10.1017/CBO9780511667275.004,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511667275.004,ancestry
R. Lyster,2004.0,DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF PROMPTS AND RECASTS IN FORM-FOCUSED INSTRUCTION,"Four teachers and their eight classes of 179 fifth-grade (10–11-year-old) students participated in this quasi-experimental classroom study, which investigated the effects of form-focused instruction (FFI) and corrective feedback on immersion students' ability to accurately assign grammatical gender in French. The FFI treatment, designed to draw attention to selected noun endings that reliably predict grammatical gender and to provide opportunities for practice in associating these endings with gender attribution, was implemented in the context of regular subject-matter instruction by three of the four teachers, each with two classes, for approximately 9 hours during a 5-week period, while the fourth teacher taught the same subject matter without FFI to two comparison classes. Additionally, each of the three FFI teachers implemented a different feedback treatment: recasts, prompts, or no feedback. Analyses of pretest, immediate-posttest, and delayed-posttest results showed a significant increase in the ability of students exposed to FFI to correctly assign grammatical gender. Results of the written tasks in particular, and to a lesser degree the oral tasks, revealed that FFI is more effective when combined with prompts than with recasts or no feedback, as a means of enabling L2 learners to acquire rule-based representations of grammatical gender and to proceduralize their knowledge of these emerging forms.This study was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (nos. 410-98-0175 and 410-2002-0988).

Because acquisition and use occur in a social context, it is important for second–language acquisition researchers to understand the ways in which social context and the acquisition and use of a second language are related. In recent years, our understanding of language as a social phenomenon has increased greatly. In a recent survey of sociolinguistics and language teaching, McKay and Hornberger (1996) divide the field into four related areas: 1) studies of language and society–how large–scale social and political issues affect language use in a particular society, 2) studies of language variation—how the “same” language varies from speaker to speaker, from place to place, and from situation to situation, 3) studies of language and interaction—how language is used in face–to–face communication, and 4) studies of language and culture—how particular cultures privilege some kinds of language over others.",,10.1017/S0267190599190068,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190599190068,ancestry

DISCOURSE APPROACHES TO ORAL LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT,"This chapter begins with a careful look at a sample conversation and examines the many layers of interpretation that different academic traditions have constructed in order to interpret it. These layers of interpretation include linguistic forms, nonverbal communication, linguistic context, situational context, and the embodied histories that participants bring to interaction. All are incorporated into a rich definition of discourse. The chapter then reviews recent studies that have compared the discourse of oral interaction in assessment with oral discourse in contexts outside assessment to show how different they are. The next section discusses studies that have related ways of speaking to the cultural values of communities of speakers with a view to understanding the cultural miscommunication that occurs in assessment of speaking in a second language community. The review concludes by stressing the wholeness of face-to-face interaction, listing the layers of interpretation of interaction that have not thus far been considered in oral testing, and setting out a potentially fertile area for future research.",,10.1017/S0267190502000132,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190502000132,ancestry
"Reeder, Florence M.",2005.0,Improving machine translation evaluation using language learner evaluation techniques,"This thesis shows that machine translation evaluation (MTE) benefits from research performed for computer-assisted language learning and second language acquisition, particularly from the area of language learner evaluation. MTE has lacked organization and principled approaches, a situation remedied in part by this dissertation. The process of organizing MTE shows commonalities with second language learner evaluation (LLE), particularly in processing ill-formed input and first language interference. These commonalities facilitate the successful application of LLE testing techniques to MTE problems. To demonstrate this, a series of experiments has been developed which use language testing research results and techniques in MTE. The first experiment shows the feasibility of adapting techniques from LLE to MTE. The second demonstrates a method for assessing the intelligibility of MT output. The third provides a new metric for measuring the adequacy of a translation's semantic content. The outcomes show the efficacy of using LLE testing, appropriately modified, in MTE. They also provide a basis for recommending a novel, effective, more automated approach to MTE.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/improving-machine-translation-evaluation-using/docview/305368258/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Reynolds-Case, Stacy Anne",2009.0,Pedagogical Discourse Styles of Native and Non-Native Language Teachers,"This study seeks to uncover the characteristics of foreign language instructors’ discourse styles implemented in the classroom when teaching students the target language. Foreign language classrooms are unique to academia because the teachers of the language, depending on whether they are native or non-native speakers of the target language, learned it in different environments and for distinct purposes. Many of the previous studies examining the effect a teacher’s ability in the target language will have on his/her instruction have focused on native and non-native speakers’ teaching styles and/or methodologies. Rather than the effect on the teacher’s style, the central question in this dissertation is how an instructor’s native or non-native ability will affect his/her pedagogical discourse when presenting the target language to students. Through the analysis of data collected from university classrooms with native and non-native instructors, three salient variances in the instructors’ teaching discourse are revealed: the effect the L1 of the students has in presenting the L2, the pronouns used to address students and refer to speakers of the target language and the students’ native language, and the positioning and quantity of code-switching implemented in the classes. Due to the non-native instructors sharing the same L1 as their students, they have an advantage of identifying the learning process of their students. Furthermore, non-native instructors build solidarity with their students by consistently using the first person plural pronoun when comparing the forms and cultures of their and the students’ L1 to the forms and cultures of the target language. Code-switching in the classroom room is unique and different from that which is heard in speech communities. Contributing to previous literature on classroom code-switching, the present study reveals two significant motivations behind the instructors’ code-switching: a pedagogical tool and topic expansion. From the results revealed in this study, the non-native speakers are more pedagogically prepared to recognize their students’ progress in the acquisition of the target language and to answer questions their students have about the target language. These results further aid in the preparation of language teachers in order to improve the overall outcome of future language students.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/pedagogical-discourse-styles-native-non-language/docview/2675222689/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Rothman, Jason",2005.0,On adult accessibility to universal grammar in second language (L2) acquisition: Some evidence from the L2 acquisition of Spanish,"The field of second language acquisition (SLA) is as vast as it is diverse. Nonetheless, the ultimate goal of all SLA researchers is one and the same; explaining how the process of adult second language (L2) acquisition occurs. This present research is undertaken from the generative paradigm of language acquisition. The dissertation is primarily concerned with providing empirical evidence in favor or against adult L2 accessibility to UG. The empirical research of this dissertation entails a study designed to test English native L2 learners of Spanish as to their ability to re-set the null-subject parameter and the status of the Overt Pronoun Constraint (OPC) in their L2 grammars. In both cases, adult L2 ability to achieve a native type grammar given these grammatical properties should implicate access to UG. However, L2 instantiation of the OPC, true poverty of the stimulus knowledge, will provide unassailable evidence. This study examines longitudinally the interlanguage grammatical development of college L2 learners of Spanish (intermediate level) enrolled in the Universidad de Madrid through the University of California education abroad program for one academic year of study abroad. The profile of the intermediate level participants in the study is as homogeneous as possible given real world limitations and discussed in detail herein. The metalinguistic judgment/performance tasks include two different tests for each syntactic property under investigation: two for the re-setting of the null-subject parameter and two for the OPC tested as a separate variable. For each syntactic feature there is one judgment task and one production task. The data indicate, at the group level, the ability to reset the pro-drop parameter and the instantiation of the OPC in general. However, the individual results indicate that, by the end of the study, a significant number of L2 learners in this population (roughly 26%) have not re-set the null-subject parameter and thus, not surprisingly, do not have the OPC instantiated into their L2 grammars. Since overall proficiency (determined separately) is not a good indicator of which L2 learners have re-set the parameter, the Variable Access Hypothesis is offered to account for these facts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/on-adult-accessibility-universal-grammar-second/docview/305032161/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Rothman, Jason;Iverson, Michael",2007.0,Input type and parameter resetting: Is naturalistic input necessary?*,"Recently, parameter values are assumed to be located within the lexicon of a particular grammar (Chomsky 1995, 2000). Because language-specific lexicons vary in terms of which functional categories, features and strengths they instantiate, parametric differences arise cross-linguistically; that is, the acquisition of the functional lexicon has a number of syntactic consequences, which explains cross-linguistic surface variation. [...]at both testing intervals, the L2 group differentiated between null and overt referential subject pronoun production based on type of matrix subject in conjunction with the co-reference interpretation favored by the context. [...]as compared to interval 1, the data from interval 2 indicate a modest decrease in overt subject use in OPC restricted environments (t = 1.70, p = 0.095), again comparing the mean difference of overt embedded pronoun production with QDP matrix subjects in bound variable vs. discourse referential contexts. Since parameter resetting is contingent on learning relevant properties from the input (i.e., features encoded in the lexicon and morphology), it is possible that the timing for this process of learning varies for adult learners. Since the resetting of the NSP requires the acquisition of new L2 features, the whole of the data provided is consistent with Full Access approaches to adult L2 acquisition (Duffield and White 1999; Schwartz and Sprouse 1996; White 1989) and provides evidence against so-called Failed Features models (e.g., Beck 1998; Franceschina 2001; Hawkins 2005; Hawkins and Franceschina 2004; Hawkins and Chan 1997; Liceras and Diaz 1999), which claim that the acquisition of new features (and thus parameter resetting) is impossible in adult acquisition as a result of a postcritical period inability to acquire functional features that are absent from the learner's L1.", General Information,10.1515/IRAL.2007.013,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/input-type-parameter-resetting-is-naturalistic/docview/204943963/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"SHULDBERG, HOWARD KELLY",1987.0,SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC ISSUES IN SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNING,"This dissertation examines second language acquisition in adults in terms of formal syntactic and semantic systems. A number of studies which stress the importance of semantic content from first language are reviewed, and the possibility that first language semantics might play an important role in interpretation of second language structures is considered. It is argued that while second language syntactic rules are learned independently from first language rules, the second language semantic system is highly dependent on first language semantics. The argument is made that not only does first language semantics play an important role in second languages with regard to lexical items, but that it also is largely responsible for the interpretation of complex strings which consist of several lexical items strung together. Two studies are reported which support the argument that first language semantics play a crucial role in second language processing. The first shows that learning difficulty for certain target language structures can be predicted in terms of the number of cognitive processes necessary to derive those structures from first language argument structures. The second shows that predicate-argument structure is more important in determining difficulty of second language structures than syntactic structure, even when syntactic structure mirrors that found in the first language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/syntactic-semantic-issues-second-language/docview/303490427/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Saalfeld, Anita Kay",2009.0,Stress in the beginning Spanish classroom: An instructional study,"Typologically, stress in Spanish and English is similar in that both languages have variable word stress. However, research done by Cutler (1986) and Soto-Faraco, Sebastián-Gallés, &amp; Cutler (2001) investigating the role of stress on lexical access indicates that there are psycholinguistic differences in the way that stress is processed by native speakers of English and Spanish. Specifically, Cutler (1986) showed that native English speakers do not use stress differences to access the lexicon. Soto-Faraco et al. (2001) performed a similar study with native speakers of Spanish; their results indicated that native Spanish speakers do rely on stress to access the lexicon. The importance of stress in lexical access in Spanish indicates that it may be worth teaching to beginning L2 Spanish learners. The remaining question is whether focused instruction results in improved perception of Spanish stress. The current study addresses this question. Participants were two intact classes of L1 English speakers enrolled in a six-week session of second semester Spanish, as well as a native English control group (n=8) and a native Spanish control group (n=8). One class served as the experimental group (n=15), and the other served as the control group (n=12). A pre-test was administered during the first week, and a post-test was administered during the last week of the session. In the intervening four weeks, the experimental group received short lessons and practice activities designed to improve their perception and production of Spanish stress; the control group received no specific instruction on Spanish stress and did not do any practice activities. To measure stress perception, participants completed a timed ABX stress discrimination task. A mixed-model ANOVA and accompanying post-hoc Scheffé tests revealed that both groups demonstrated significant improvement between pre-test and post-test, but there were no significant differences between groups in terms of accuracy of response. However, the experimental group did demonstrate an improvement in response time on the post-test which was significantly different from the response time of the control group, indicating that instruction may be beneficial.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/stress-beginning-spanish-classroom-instructional/docview/304894838/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Method . (1)&#xa0;The F/SL research on persistence and dropout was reviewed narratively and meta-analyzed to identify other strong predictors based on previous findings. (2)&#xa0;An instrument containing affective factor items and background information was developed and presented to 233 college students studying Japanese as a foreign language. The data were analyzed using the Rasch measurement and logistic regression to construct a predictive model. (3)&#xa0;A classroom with 10 students was observed for 3 months and voluntary participation was coded, and the relationship between voluntary participation and persistence/dropout was examined. (4)&#xa0;Students and teachers were interviewed to gain further insight into the phenomenon of persistence and dropout in FL study. Results . The results of the literature review showed consistent evidence that reported the predictive power of motivation/attitude and achievement. A model for predicting student persistence/dropout was constructed based on motivation and several other variables. The model achieved 78% correct prediction of student persistence/dropout, with motivation and schedule conflicts being significant predictors. The predictive probabilities for 9 students generated from this model, however, were found to have no association with voluntary FL classroom participation. A one-quarter observation (10 weeks) and interviews with students suggested that a simple dichotomy in the concept of persistence/dropout may be inappropriate. Conclusions . Student persistence/dropout in FL study is predictable with a certain degree of accuracy. Classroom participation may not have a strong relationship with persistence/dropout, however. Recommendations for further research and implications for theory and practice are provided.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/persistence-dropout-foreign-language-learning/docview/304614723/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Satomi Takahashi,2001.0,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: The role of input enhancement in developing pragmatic competence,"Introduction Input enhancement in second language acquisition (SLA) has been addressed in studies of form-focused instruction at morphosyntactic levels, known as Focus on Form (FonF) research (e.g., White, Spada, Lightbown & Ranta, 1991; Carroll, Swain & Roberge, 1992; Fotos, 1993; Spada & Lightbown, 1993; Trahey & White, 1993; see Doughty & Williams, 1998; Long & Robinson, 1998, for an overview). Following Sharwood Smith's (1991, 1993) definition of input enhancement, researchers experimentally manipulated instructional input on L2 structures in various ways: some form of corrective feedback with or without metalinguistic information (e.g., Doughty & Varela, 1998), visual enhancement (textual modification) with the use of bold or italic face (e.g., Alanen, 1995; Jourdenais, Ota, Stauffer, Boyson, & Doughty, 1995; J. White, 1998), and task manipulation directing learners to notice and attend to target structures (e.g., Hulstijn, 1989; Robinson, 1996; Williams & Evans, 1998). All of these studies provided evidence that high levels of attention-drawing activities, as represented by presenting metalinguistic information and corrective feedback, are more helpful for learners in gaining the mastery of target-language structures than simple exposure to positive evidence. These findings thus provide the basis for theoretical verification of Schmidt's (1993a, 1995, 1998) Noticing Hypothesis, which states that conscious noticing is the necessary and sufficient condition for converting input to intake.

"Sawasaki, Koichi",2007.0,L2 reading by learners of Japanese: A comparison of different L1s,"This study investigates the processing strategies learners of Japanese employ while reading Japanese. Language researchers theorize that native speakers process sentences incrementally. However, little is known about processing in a second language when the first and second languages are typologically different. For example, English and Chinese take an SVO word order with little or no overt Case marking while Japanese and Korean take an SOV word order with overt Case marking. In SVO languages, verb information may provide upcoming postverbal information, and in SOV languages, preverbal information (Case information) may provide upcoming information for argument and verb. Based on these assumptions, this study examines how groups of Japanese language learners process sentences in reading when their first languages are English, Chinese, or Korean. Of special interest is whether learners process arguments and adjuncts differently before reaching a verb. Equally, of another piece of interest is how each learner group reads each phrase of a sentence. Experiments with self-paced reading tasks were conducted with two intermediate and one advanced Japanese level of English groups, an advanced Japanese level of Chinese group, an advanced Japanese level of Korean group, and a control group (native speakers of Japanese). Results of the experiments revealed that advanced learners as well as the control group showed some sensitivity to the arguments/adjuncts differentiation. English-speaking intermediate groups failed to demonstrate the distinction, but all learner groups provided some indication that they tried to employ incremental processing in a way that seemed most appropriate for their ability level. When reading times at each phrase are examined, advanced learner groups (English L1, Chinese L1, and Korean L1) showed similar reading patterns regardless of their L1s, but groups of a different proficiency level (native speakers, advanced learners, and intermediate learners) exhibited reading patterns distinctive to each group in terms of where the reading times were elevated. We argue that distinctive patterns occur because learners (especially those with lower proficiency) experience cognitive limitations due to lacking linguistic experiences and knowledge in the target language.

"Schau, Kaori Deguchi",2000.0,The effects of first language orthographic variation on second language Japanese word recognition,"The present study investigated whether learners of Japanese with different L1 orthographic backgrounds differ from each other in processing Japanese words. Based on previous findings that visual information processing in L1 varies to some extent depending on the type of orthography, it was presumed that L1 orthographic variation might have effects on L2 word processing. In the present study, English-, Chinese-, and Korean-speaking learners of Japanese performed a lexical decision task and a sentence judgment task. The target words were basic verbs written either in sound-based Hiragana letters only or in a combination of a meaning-based Kanji character and Hiragana letters. A statistical analysis indicated that Chinese-speaking learners were faster than English- and Korean-speaking learners in both orthographic conditions. There was no significant difference between English- and Korean-speaking learners. Subjects' comments in a questionnaire about how they processed Hiragana and Kanji revealed considerable individual differences in terms of preference for either orthography. These results are discussed in terms of reliance on either phonological information or visual/orthographic information in the process of L2 Japanese word recognition.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-first-language-orthographic-variation-on/docview/304616237/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Seo, Mi-Suk",2008.0,A conversation -analytic study of repair practices in one -on -one ESL tutoring,"Using a conversation analytic methodology, this study focuses on interactional practices called ""repair,"" which address a wide range of problems in speaking, hearing, and understanding talk-in-interaction. More specifically, it examines how tutors and tutees use repair practices to deal with the tutees' linguistic troubles or errors in one-on-one ESL tutoring sessions. It investigates how these repair practices are used in a way that manifests the participants' orientation for L2 teaching and learning and how they are different from those in other L2 interactional settings. It also explores how the repair practices are coordinated with gesture. The investigation of the instances of repair in my data set shows that the tutees often initiate repair on their own talk by engaging in searches for syntactic features as well as searches for words and phrases and solicit their tutors' assistance by using various interactional resources. In these instances, the tutees invoke the tutors' linguistic expertise as relevant in resolving their troubles, and the tutors respond in a way that displays their pedagogical orientations. In the cases of tutors' repair initiation on their tutees' linguistic troubles or problems, they initiate repair both for communicative reasons and for pedagogical purposes. In each case, the tutors' repair (initiation) often results in unique interactional trajectories, such as the participants' revisit to the trouble source after the completion of the current sequence or an occurrence of another repair sequence due to the tutees' misunderstanding of the tutors' repair initiation. Also, the tutors are found to respond differently to the tutees' linguistics errors when they are produced in the first pair part of an adjacency pair, which requires certain types of responsive actions. In terms of coordination between repair and gesture, gestures are often used in the tutees' word searches in their efforts to fill in the lexical gaps and to elicit the sought-for-items from the tutors. During the word searches, the tutees sometimes produce verbal solutions that do not match their concurrent gestures, and it engenders the tutors' corrective feedback. In addition, gestures are used as repair initiators, signaling problems in understanding or hearing the prior talk, and these gestures result in the original speakers' linguistic modifications of their prior utterances. Finally, gestures are found to be salient interactional resources in repair completion. When their recipients initiate repair on their prior utterances, the tutors and the tutees sometimes add gestures or revise their prior gestures, while repeating the same utterances. Overall, repair sequences in ESL tutoring provide important clues in understanding the distinctive organization of ESL tutoring as a specific speech event. They constitute critical sequential environments in which the institutional goals of the speech event (i.e., L2 teaching and learning) become more demonstrably oriented to and more actively pursued by the participants.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/conversation-analytic-study-repair-practices-one/docview/304628068/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shibata, Miki",2000.0,Comparing lexical aspect and narrative discourse in second language learners’ tense -aspect morphology: A cross sectional study of Japanese as a second language,"The current study has attempted to answer the question whether there is an interaction between the Aspect Hypothesis and the Discourse Hypothesis by investigating the use of Japanese tense-aspect morphology by native speakers of English learning Japanese as L2. These two hypotheses were argued for independently in previous studies, but never consolidated to account for the distributional pattern of L2 tense-aspect morphology. The Aspect Hypothesis claims that the L1 and L2 learners initially mark lexical aspect of the verbs with tense-aspect morphology; they tend to associate past with achievement verbs and progressive with activity verbs. On the other hand, according to the Discourse Hypothesis, the learners use the tense-aspect morphology to distinguish grounding; they tend to mark foreground with past more frequently than background. The current research used two methods: a multiple-choice task and a storytelling task. The former task was referred to as Study 1. The use of tense-aspect morphology in the story-telling task was analyzed in terms of lexical aspect, referred to as Study 2 and grounding, referred to as Study 3. Study 1 and Study 2 examined whether the use of tense-aspect morphology is different in obligatory contexts and in narrative discourse. The results of Study 1 supported the Aspect Hypothesis; L2 learners initially associated past inflection with achievement verbs and tended to mark the process encoded in activity and accomplishment verbs with present durative. The results of Study 2 supported the Aspect Hypothesis as regards the association of activity verbs and present durative. However, the frequent marking of past on achievement verbs across the proficiency levels suggest that the textual function of tense-aspect morphology plays a role in narrative discourse. Study 3 argued that the Japanese tense-aspect morphology weakly mark grounding. Finally, I claimed that the Aspect Hypothesis and the Discourse Hypothesis account for the different acquisition stages of the L2 tense-aspect system. There is a time lag among the tense-aspect morphemes in the process of acquisition; past marking functions as the temporal and textual device in narrative discourse at the relatively early stage while present durative remains as the marker of lexical aspect.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comparing-lexical-aspect-narrative-discourse/docview/304584522/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shibuya, Rinko",2004.0,A synchronic and diachronic study on sex exclusive differences in the modern Japanese language,"This dissertation investigates Japanese morphological sex exclusive differences synchronically and diachronically. In my synchronic investigation, I examine the data of natural conversation in informal situations collected from different sex, age, and dialect groups. This investigation reveals that, contrary to the prevailing idea, overt sex exclusive differences occur with striking infrequency in both Tokyo and non-Tokyo dialects. In contrast, covert differences are carefully preserved in the Tokyo dialect. Among non-Tokyo dialects, which had little sex differences before, covert differences are spreading. Since previous linguistic studies have focused only on what was explicitly spoken (or written), such covert sex differences have been overlooked. I illustrate these phenomena postulating two types of rules, prescriptive and proscriptive, which operate upon speakers to maintain mutual exclusiveness between male speech and female speech. Prescriptive rules emphasize the differences between the sexes. Proscriptive rules prohibit transgressions of the boundaries between the sexes. Since preferred images of a gender change over time, prescriptive rules are fluid. On the other hand, the violation of proscriptive rules brings serious penalty to speakers. In order to clarify how such rules were engendered, I explore the historical process in which certain forms were designated as gendered as they are in present-day Japan. I argue that this designation is the consequence of the amalgamation of several socio-historical changes that took place in the Meiji period (1868–1912). These are: (1)&#xa0;the influx of English words, which triggered the formation of new intonational variants of the existent forms, (2)&#xa0;the introduction of western notions of ‘love’, which triggered the creation of a new female figure in the Meiji novels and, (3)&#xa0;the establishment of standard Japanese and the subsequent development of the mass media, which promulgated the concept that the informal speech of the Tokyo dialect was the model speech for women in general. My diachronic investigation also reveals that the function of female speech is to mark feminine sexuality. This function explains why sex differences in informal situations occur much less than generally believed, and why using female speech is inappropriate in formal situations, even though it is polite speech.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/synchronic-diachronic-study-on-sex-exclusive/docview/305220208/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shin, Chang Won",2007.0,"Korean EFL learners' knowledge of semantic, morphological, and syntactic properties of English verbs: The relationships of lexical and grammatical knowledge","The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between lexical and grammatical knowledge in the L2 acquisition of English by Korean EFL learners by examining how the depth of lexical knowledge that Korean learners have about English verbs is related to their grammatical knowledge. For this study, L2 research into depth of lexical knowledge and generative syntactic theory have been reviewed to suggest the interdependent nature of vocabulary and grammar in L2 acquisition (Nation, 1990, 2001; Chomsky, 1981, 1986, 1995; Herschensohn, 2000). Data were collected from Korean EFL learners through a depth of vocabulary knowledge test which focused on semantic, morphological, and syntactic properties of English verbs and a grammar test. The results showed that there was a high positive correlation between vocabulary and grammar knowledge in L2 English acquisition by Korean learners, and that semantic, morphological, and syntactic properties of lexical knowledge all contributed to the prediction of L2 learners' grammatical knowledge. In particular, the syntactic property of lexical knowledge was found to be the most important predictor of grammatical knowledge. However, it was also found that the morphological property was not as important in the prediction of L2 grammatical knowledge as the syntactic property. Based on these findings, it was argued that the in-depth view of L2 lexical knowledge might be appropriate for explaining the interdependent nature of lexical and grammatical knowledge, since this in-depth perspective sees lexical knowledge as consisting of various properties such as semantic, morphological, and syntactic features. On the other hand, a generative view on syntax also seems to provide an account of how each property of lexical knowledge would be related to overall grammatical knowledge. Thus, the syntactic property of word knowledge such as argument structures and subcategorization frames might serve as a connector which links lexical and grammatical knowledge. Finally, some possible accounts of why the morphological property of vocabulary knowledge did not contribute as much to the prediction of L2 grammatical knowledge as the syntactic property were provided on the basis of the notion of argument structures, the characteristics of morphological knowledge assessed by the in-depth vocabulary test, and L2 lexical development model proposed by Jiang (2000).", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/korean-efl-learners-knowledge-semantic/docview/304811073/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Shirai, Yasuhiro;Ozeki, Hiromi",2007.0,INTRODUCTION,"Typological linguistics has made important contributions to our understanding of SLA processes, especially in the early days of SLA research (e.g., Eckman, 1977; Hyltenstam, 1977; Rutherford, 1984). In particular, the noun phrase accessibility hierarchy (NPAH), originally proposed as a generalization based on typological work by Keenan and Comrie (1977), has served as a basis on which many SLA studies are conducted. The NPAH predicts the ease of relativization as a function of the grammatical role of the head noun phrase (NP) modified by the relative clause (RC) observed in languages of the world: subject (SU) &gt; direct object (DO) &gt; indirect object (IO) &gt; oblique (OBL) &gt; genitive (GEN) &gt; object of comparison (OComp). If a language can relativize on a position on the hierarchy, then it follows that any other higher position (or position to the left in the given schematic) can also be relativized on. For example, if a language has an OComp relative (e.g., the man who I am taller than), then it has a GEN relative (e.g., the man whose father I know) and all of the others higher on the hierarchy (i.e., OBL, IO, DO, and SU).

The study aims at exploring the actual effect of these usages by learners, but not limited to viewing them from a traditional perspective, which emphasizes the level of politeness at a sentence level, but by investigating characteristic discourse features in Japanese such as speech level. The study employs a case study methodology within a qualitative research framework. The participants, who are advanced learners of Japanese, conversed with a native Japanese speaker who is a stranger to them. Results from the study show deviations from the Japanese norm, but they also suggest that learners may have their own value system and employ it in conversation with Japanese. Some implications for cross-cultural communication and language teaching are drawn from these findings.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/politeness-conversation-between-native-non/docview/304662177/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Song, Grace U.",1997.0,Cross-linguistic differences in the expression of motion events and their implications for second language acquisition,"This work examines lexical knowledge in second language acquisition through a case study of motion expressions and their acquisition by second language learners. Systematic cross-linguistic differences have been attested in the expression of motion events: two distinct patterns for expressing motion can be found across languages. The expression of motion thus provides a well-defined domain for studying the transfer and acquisition of lexical knowledge in a second language. My research indicates that second language learners have underlying knowledge of certain universal aspects of verb meaning, and that this knowledge guides them in their acquisition of motion expressions in their second language even when their first and second languages differ in this respect. I first propose an analysis of motion events and their expression from an event-structure perspective. On this account, motion events can be classified into one of several types according to elements of meaning that have been identified as being relevant to syntax across languages. Languages differ, however, in how these meaning components can be combined within lexical items and phrases. In particular, languages differ whether type-shifting is possible, or, the ability of verbs and other lexical items associated with simple event types to combine and express a complex event type. I propose that the cross-linguistic differences in the expression of motion events are due to the difference in the availability of type-shifting. Besides more accurately accounting for cross-linguistic differences in the expression of motion, my analysis makes predictions about how motion expressions can be acquired when the first and second language differ with respect to type-shifting. Talking about a motion event involves knowledge of semantically based event types, relevant in all languages, and knowledge of language-specific compositional possibilities. If learners construe motion events in terms of the relevant event types, certain properties of the input should alert them to the type-shifting possibilities in their second language. I test these predictions in three experiments and find that learners make the relevant distinctions among event types in their second language, which in turn, should help them learn to express motion events appropriately in their second language.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/cross-linguistic-differences-expression-motion/docview/304359991/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Song, Hyang Suk;Schwartz, Bonnie D",2009.0,"TESTING THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE HYPOTHESIS: L2 ADULT, L2 CHILD, AND L1 CHILD COMPARISONS IN THE ACQUISITION OF KOREAN WH-CONSTRUCTIONS WITH NEGATIVE POLARITY ITEMS","The fundamental difference hypothesis (FDH; Bley-Vroman, 1989, 1990) contends that the nature of language in natives is fundamentally different from the nature of language in adult nonnatives. This study tests the FDH in two ways: (a) via second language (L2) poverty-of-the-stimulus (POS) problems (e.g., Schwartz &amp; Sprouse, 2000) and (b) via a comparison between adult and child L2 learners, whose first language (L1) is the same, in terms of their developmental route (e.g., Schwartz, 1992, 2003). The phenomena under investigation are Korean wh-constructions with negative polarity items (NPIs). Korean has subject (S)-object (O)-verb (V) as its canonical word order and it is also a wh-in-situ language, but scrambling of the object to presubject position (i.e., movement that results in OSV word order) is generally optional; however, in the context of negative questions with a NPI subject (e.g., amwuto ""anyone""), (a) object wh-phrases must scramble on the wh-question reading and (b) the nonscrambled order has a yes/no-question reading. These properties of Korean wh-constructions with NPIs constitute POS problems for nonnatives whose L1 is English (as well as for native Korean-acquiring children). L1-English adult L2 learners (n = 15) and L1-English child L2 learners (n = 10), independently assessed for Korean proficiency, as well as L1-Korean children (n = 23) and L1-Korean adults (n = 15) completed an elicited-production task, an acceptability-judgment task, and an interpretation-verification task. The results show that (a) high-proficiency (adult and child) L2 learners performed like the native adult controls on all three tasks, thereby demonstrating L2 POS effects; and (b) adult and child L2 learners follow the same (inferred) route to convergence, a route differing from--yet subsuming--the L1-child route. Both sets of results lead us to conclude that, contra the FDH, the nature of language is fundamentally similar in natives and (adult or child) nonnatives.

Stephanie W. Cheng,2005.0,An exploratory cross-sectional study of interlanguage pragmatic development of expressions of gratitude by Chinese learners of English,"The present study is an exploratory cross-sectional study of interlanguage pragmatic development of expressions of gratitude, specifically, gratitude after receiving a favor. Expressing gratitude is a speech act that is taught at an early age and is commonly performed by native speakers of most languages. It is, thus, often assumed that learners can successfully say thank you in the target language. However, studies show that even advanced learners have difficulty adequately expressing gratitude. The objectives of the present study are: (a) to investigate how native speakers of Chinese and native speakers of English express gratitude as defined by length of speech and use of strategies; (b) to examine whether there is evidence of pragmatic development in the speech act behavior of expressions of gratitude among Chinese learners of English with the increase of the length of residence in the United States; and (c) to examine whether there is evidence of pragmatic influence from L1 Chinese in English expressions of gratitude among Chinese learners of English. The data were collected through a discourse completion task questionnaire. Subjects’ responses were classified into eight thanking strategies. Descriptive and t-test analyses were conducted to identify the pragmatic differences that distinguished the behavior of the three English learner groups, which varied according to their length of stay in the United States, from that of Chinese and English native speakers. The results show that Chinese and English native speakers have different preferences for thanking strategies in the eight situations. They are significantly different in the length of speech and use of strategies. In addition, there is a positive effect of the length of residence in the United States on English learners’ pragmatic development. The results also show evidence of pragmatic influence from L1 Chinese. Moreover, contextual variables, social status, familiarity and imposition, have a significant influence on the length of speech and the use of strategies for all subject groups.",,10.17077/ETD.5MJL4I0Y,https://doi.org/10.17077/ETD.5MJL4I0Y,forward
"Su, Dantao",2008.0,"Why passivize the nonpassivizable? Conceptual space, argument structure and L1 transfer in L2 acquisition of English unaccusatives","This dissertation explores the overpassivization errors in Chinese-speaking learners' acquisition of English as a learnability problem connected with L1 and L2 acquisition of argument structure. It attributes the differences in the final state of L1 and L2 acquisition to the differences in their respective initial state of conceptual compartmentalization based on the systematic cross-linguistic comparison of English and Chinese unaccusatives in terms of their semantic class memberships, selected argument structure construction matrices and patterns of interaction between the semantic constants of verbs and of argument structure constructions in the two languages. A judgment task administrated to 750 participants at three proficiency levels consisting of 24 sampled English alternating and nonalternating unaccusatives divided into six types and placed in the transitive, passive and unaccusative construction yielded the following results: (1) Chinese-speaking learners at the very advanced stage attained near target-like usage of English unaccusatives without representation of L2-specific conceptual dimensions that constrain the compartmentalization of notions and concepts and perspective taking in event structure conceptualization; (2) The learners passivized unaccusatives without equally transitivizing them; (3) The learners passivized alternating unaccusatives to a greater extent than nonalternating unaccusatives; (4) The learners demonstrated inaccessibilty to the semantic meaning of unaccusatives and the unaccusative construction in their L1. These findings have implications for the persistence of L1-specific pattern of conceptual compartmentalization in L2 acquisition, L2 overpassivization as a result of overt marking of the semantic contrasts between unaccusatives and unergatives, L2 judgment of unaccusatives being influenced by their grammaticalness in particular constructions and the consequences of language modulization.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/why-passivize-nonpassivizable-conceptual-space/docview/304604525/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Sugaya, Natsue;Shirai, Yasuhiro",2007.0,"THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRESSIVE AND RESULTATIVE MEANINGS OF THE IMPERFECTIVE ASPECT MARKER BY L2 LEARNERS OF JAPANESE: Transfer, Universals, or Multiple Factors?","It has been observed that there is a strong association between the inherent (lexical) aspect of verbs and the acquisition of tense-aspect morphology (the aspect hypothesis; Andersen &amp; Shirai, 1994). To investigate why such an association is observed, this study examined the influence of inherent aspect and learners' first language (L1) on the acquisition of Japanese imperfective aspect by using two tasks--an acceptability judgment test and an oral picture description task--with two groups of second language learners of Japanese: 26 native speakers (NSs) of English, which has the obligatory progressive, and 35 NSs of languages that have no obligatory progressive marking (German and Slavic languages). The results from the acceptability judgment test support the aspect hypothesis in that, regardless of L1, the imperfective marker -te i-ru was strongly associated with activity verbs for lower proficiency learners. However, the results from the oral task did not support the prediction, in that lower proficiency L1 nonprogressive learners did not show any such preference. The results suggest that L1 plays a role in the formation of the acquisition pattern predicted by the aspect hypothesis, but that given the complex interaction with task types and proficiency, L1 transfer cannot be the sole reason for the predicted association in the acquisition of Japanese -te i-(ru). It is argued that multiple factors are at work when learners create the form-meaning associations predicted by the aspect hypothesis.

"Suzuki, Wataru",2009.0,"Languaging, direct correction, and second language writing: Japanese university students of English","It has been suggested that languaging plays a crucial role in learning a second language (L2). The effect of languaging, especially oral languaging (e.g., collaborative dialogue, private speech), has been tested on the learning of L2 knowledge domains. Many studies have shown a positive relation between oral languaging during problem solving tasks and subsequent performance on various post-test measures. The paucity of empirical research on written languaging (e.g., written reflection, written/typed explanations, and diaries) in second language acquisition (SLA) research, despite its theoretical importance for learning and the empirical evidence documented in non-L2 knowledge domains, prompted this exploratory study. This study explored the effects of written languaging about the direct corrections provided on draft essays written by 24 Japanese learners of English. The effect of both the type (e.g., grammar-based vs. lexis-based) and the quality (e.g., noticing with reasons vs. noticing only) of written languaging was assessed by subsequent text revisions. Three major findings emerged. First, written languaging about direct feedback on linguistic errors in the first essay helped learners successfully correct these errors during immediate revision and possibly aided in rendering the new essay more accurate. Second, both lexis- and grammar-based written languaging were associated with improved accuracy. Third, both written languaging at the level of noticing only and written languaging at the level of noticing with reasons were associated with accuracy improvement. These findings appear to support Swain's (2006b) claim that providing learners with the opportunity to language about or reflect on their developing linguistic knowledge in the course of L2 learning mediates L2 learning and development. Theoretical and pedagogical implications are also discussed in this thesis study. Theoretically, the study, together with other research indicates that we learn an L2 not only by manipulating the linguistic input inside the head but also by externalizing it via speaking and writing (i.e., languaging). Pedagogically, the implications of the study may suggest that L2 teachers should ask their students to reflect, in diaries, journals, and portfolios, on the linguistic problems they have encountered during their classroom activities.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/languaging-direct-correction-second-language/docview/305102609/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Past research has demonstrated that native speakers of English automatically recognize speech acts when they comprehend utterances (Holtgraves & Ashley, 2001). The present research examined whether this occurs for participants learning English as a second language. Participants read conversational utterances and then performed a lexical decision task (decide whether a target string of letters is a word). Consistent with past research, native speakers performed this task more quickly when the target string was the speech act associated with the preceding utterance. In contrast, nonnative speakers did not demonstrate this effect, suggesting that speech act activation is not an automatic component of comprehension for people acquiring a second language.",,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00429.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00429.X,forward

"Tada, Masao",2005.0,Assessment of EFL pragmatic production and perception using video prompts,"This study describes an investigation of the development of EFL learners' pragmatic production and perception of the speech acts of requests, refusals, and apologies using video prompts, which were part of a computerized data collection instrument. These three face-threatening acts were chosen because of their importance and difficulty for non-native speakers of English. Forty-eight Japanese learners of English took part in this study. The results showed that pragmatic production develops hand in hand with overall English proficiency to some extent, whereas pragmatic perception is relatively independent of proficiency. This trend was consistent across the three speech acts, across two imposition levels, as well as in a variety of situations. A correlation analysis suggested that the learners' production and perception may be dependent upon different speech acts. Among possible explanations for the phenomena were the learners' linguistic constraints, the transfer of L1 pragmatic knowledge, and the learners' beliefs about L2 pragmatic rules. Neither production nor perception had developed fully from the perspective of the native speaker judges, probably because of the paucity of input containing these speech acts in the Japanese EFL context. These results suggest that EFL learners need opportunities to receive input containing English speech acts and to practice both perceiving and producing speech acts in order to be pragmatically competent in L2 English. The low level of pragmatic development also suggested that the inclusion of lower proficiency learners is important when investigating EFL learners' pragmatic abilities. In terms of the research methodology, the use of the video-prompted computerized procedure and the use of oral data proved to be useful. In a supplementary analysis of the construct validity of the instruments with 107 Japanese learners of English, a principal component analysis showed that while the context-internal parameters for apologies and requests showed a one component solution, which supported previous research findings, the context-internal parameters for refusals appeared to be made up of two different constructs: the speaker-related component and the recipient-related component. In sum, this study addresses several important issues in the investigation of learners' speech acts, and issues in the teaching of pragmatic competence in EFL contexts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/assessment-efl-pragmatic-production-perception/docview/305448399/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Other written materials were collected from a Japanese school, and classrooms at a British school were observed. There are three research questions: whether the school texts are different in terms of topical progression (consisting of parallel, extended parallel, sequential and extended sequential progressions), what implications the results have in terms of genre and what implications the results have for Contrastive Rhetoric (CR) research. A review of CR literature suggests a need for further studies in this area, particularly for the exploration of the cultural and educational contexts, where preferred L1 discourse structures are likely to be taught and practised. It also raises an issue of genre, questioning whether expository writing, which has been the yardstick genre of CR research, is universally practised. Another issue is the search for a methodological framework for text analysis which can relate textual features to 'rhetorical organisation'. The apparently universal discourse structure of a meaningful utterance, topic - comment, and the central role of information structure in the construction of coherence, suggest Topical Structure Analysis (TSA) as the framework. The application of TSA to Japanese is discussed and found to be appropriate. The examination of the materials from the Japanese school and the observation of English and Religious Education classes in the British school reveal that expository writing is not practised in the Japanese school; instead, writing is used for self-reflection and self-growth. In the British school, expository writing is the major means of learning and assessment. The writing used in the Japanese school is characterised by parallel progression while English expository writing is likely to contain many topical progressions due to its clear focus on a limited number of topics and its logical nature. The TSA results show substantial differences of occurrence of topical progressions: the English texts contain more topical progressions, suggesting that they rely more than the Japanese texts on repetition of important items in conveying a sense of coherence. Parallel progression is the only type of progression that occurs more in the Japanese texts than the English texts. Examination of the results reveals the roles of topical progressions: parallel progressions for accumulation of information/descriptions, sequential progressions for development of argument, extended parallel and extended sequential progressions for repetition of important items throughout the text. The differences in the mean occurrences of topical progressions are found to be due to the difference of genre or function between the two data sets: the Japanese texts are expressive and the English texts transactional. The use of parallel progressions is associated with description within the expressive texts and the use of the other progression types is associated with the argumentative nature of English school essays. The potential of the topical marker wa in Japanese for the construction of coherence is discussed. By providing a clearer coding scheme, this study contributes to TSA studies and CR research in general. The findings support a number of earlier CR findings. Although the limited sample size prevents generalisation, the findings hint at an association between lack of experience in argumentatiy writing among Japanese secondary pupils and the L2 writing performance of Japanese students at English speaking universities. Analysis based on TSA, while unable to detect every feature of coherence in text, has the potential to provide useful data for L2 writing classrooms and for future CR research relating textual features to coherence construction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comparative-study-english-japanese-school-texts/docview/2037199305/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Takahashi, Nobuaki",2007.0,"The differential effects of perceptual saliency on recasts in L2 Japanese: Learners' noticing, interpretation, detection, and subsequent oral production","The purpose of the present study is to investigate the differential effects of perceptual saliency added to recasts on learners' attentional allocation and their subsequent utterances. Classroom-based research on recasts, generally understood as implicit negative evidence, finds them to be teachers' most frequently used corrective feedback technique. However, the effectiveness of recasts in triggering immediate uptake or even attention has been questioned whereas a positive effect has been reported in many experimental studies. One source of divergent findings may be the assumption that recasts are a form of implicit feedback, leading researchers to interpret their results as learners not noticing recasts' corrective intent. Equipping recasts with perceptual saliency via input enhancement adds power to recasts, making them explicit enough to trigger noticing and to stimulate reformulation, but not too explicit to impede communication. Given that one possible explanation for the ambiguous results is perceptual saliency of recasts, a new typology of recasts is warranted. This study proposes that recasts can be provided in an explicit manner, suggesting that the notion of explicitness should be considered in a continuum, rather than dichotomous distinction. While engaging in picture description tasks with a native speaker, high-beginner to low-intermediate Japanese-as-a-foreign-language learners received different types of corrective feedback (salient corrective recasts, nonsalient corrective recasts, and negotiation moves) on their erroneous uses of Japanese numeral classifiers. The NS/NNS interactions and learners' comments from stimulated recall protocol were analyzed in terms of learners' attentional allocation and subsequent oral production following the provision of each corrective feedback. The study findings indicated that adding the element of perceptual saliency to the construct of recasts increased the chance of eliciting learners' successful repair and attentional allocation, while perceptually nonsalient recast was least effective. The corrective force of perceptually salient recasts, however, was so robust that it may not effectively trigger learners' metalinguistic awareness. While negotiation moves were beneficial to prompt learners' metalinguistic awareness, learners needed positive evidence (i.e., recasts) when their linguistic knowledge was insufficient for self-correction.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/differential-effects-perceptual-saliency-on/docview/304858344/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Takeuchi-Furuya, Reiko",1993.0,A study of the naturalistic acquisition of Japanese by two native speakers of English in Japan,"This dissertation is a longitudinal case study of the natural second language acquisition of Japanese by two speakers of English in Japan. The two female adult learners, instructors in English at junior high school in Japan, knew no Japanese on their arrival in Japan and received no formal instruction thereafter. The researcher (a native speaker of Japanese) met with each of the subjects once every two weeks for approximately a year. During these sessions, the learners performed a number of tasks in Japanese (making origami, describing pictures, teaching cooking and so on). In addition to transcribed data from those sessions, other sources of data included their scores on three tests (GEFT, MLAT and PLAB), questionnaires that they answered on affective variables and diaries that they kept throughout the study. The development of linguistic output by the two learners was very similar to the composite picture of the interlanguage continuum described by Ellis in 1984 (Classroom Second Language Development). At the end of the study, both learners were in the third stage of the continuum, just short of Ellis' last stage. The two learners' initial test scores were the same, and the questionnaire administered at the beginning of the study showed them to be very similar in attitude and other cognitive variables. The diaries kept throughout the study, however, showed differences in their reactions to their naturalistic language learning experiences in Japan. One learner reported feeling more confident and hopeful, less frustrated and angry, than the other. The two learners' developmental patterns in the acquisition of (a) negative inflection in Japanese and (b) Japanese particles were compared to the developmental patterns of Japanese children learning their first language. Both similarities and differences were found. The nature of the input received by the learners (i.e., the ""foreigner talk"" used by the researcher) was also analyzed. Not all features of typical foreigner talk were present at the beginning; some features increased in frequency as the study progressed, some features decreased, and some features remained constant.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/study-naturalistic-acquisition-japanese-two/docview/304077214/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Talmy, Steven",2005.0,"Lifers and FOBs, rocks and resistance: Generation 1.5, identity, and the cultural productions of ESL in a high school","This two and a half year-long critical ethnography considers “the cultural productions of the ESL student” (Levinson, Foley, &amp; Holland, 1996) at a multilingual, multiethnic high school in Hawai'i. Specifically, it considers two broadly competing cultural productions of ESL in the high school context, an official, school-sanctioned cultural production, and an oppositional “generation 1.5” ESL student cultural production. The former is examined through national and state educational and language policies aimed at ESL students, ESL program organization, intra-institutional relationships, curriculum, and instructional practices. The generation 1.5, or long-term, US-educated learners of ESL (Harklau, Losey, &amp; Siegal, 1999), cultural productions are considered through analysis of an array of situated social practices these students take up in ESL classrooms that are both indexical of their resistance and that work to make the ESL program precisely what it is these students claim to be resisting: a slowed down, low-prestige, academically inconsequential program. Six primary “performance strike” (Shor, 1992) practices are considered in microanalytic detail: not bringing books to class, not doing classwork, starting late and finishing early, resisting and reproducing “FOBeing,” bargaining, and “Worksheet Syndrome.” As well, four “defensive teaching” (McNeil, 1986) accommodations are similarly analysed: study hall, floating deadlines, alternative assignments, and test preparation. The study is broadly situated within a social practice theoretical framework, and draws specifically on communities of practice (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and language socialization (Schiefflin &amp; Ochs, 1996; Ochs, 1996; Duff, 2002, 2003). A central point is that as the ESL teachers and students are agents multiply situated in historical, political, and social contexts, the cultural productions of ESL are not simply one-way, top-down phenomena, nor are they mere reflections of negative societal valuations about immigrants, bi- and multilingualism, and non-native Englishes. Rather, they are jointly constructed by teachers and students in the social practices of everyday classroom life. In these terms, the study highlights the situated, contingent, multidirectional socialization processes that occur among teachers and students, and how these can affect L2 teaching and learning.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/lifers-fobs-rocks-resistance-generation-1-5/docview/305001534/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tamanaha, Masako",2003.0,Interlanguage speech act realization of apologies and complaints: The performances of Japanese L2 speakers in comparison with Japanese L1 and English L1 speakers,"Scholars of interlanguage pragmatics have been researching cross-cultural differences of speech act realization and second/foreign language learners' acquisition of these speech acts (e.g., Cohen &amp; Olshtain, 1981, 1996), and transfer from L1 at the pragmatic level is argued to exist (e.g., Kasper, 1992). Takahashi &amp; Beebe (1987, 1993) contend that the transfer effect is greater among high proficiency learners than among their low-proficiency counterparts because the former have enough control over the target language to utilize their L1 pragmatics in the L2. However, some studies find that the advanced learners better approximated the native speakers' performance in some uses of speech act strategies (e.g., Trosborg, 1995). This study investigates apologies and complaints elicited through interactive role-plays that are performed by American learners of Japanese, who are at intermediate (J2L) and advanced (J2H) levels in using Japanese. Native speakers of Japanese (J1) and native speakers of American English (E1) are used as comparison groups. Specifically, the present study analyzes (1)&#xa0;the characteristics of apologies and complaints produced by the J1s and the E1s, (2)&#xa0;the characteristics of Japanese learners' apologies and complaints in terms of L1 transfer and linguistic difficulties in performing such speech acts in L2, and (3)&#xa0;proficiency effects that become apparent between the J2Ls and the J2Hs. The results indicate that there are cross-cultural differences found in apology role-plays; namely, there is a tendency for the E1 speakers to prefer more rational strategies whereas the J1 speakers prefer emotional strategies as previously attested (e.g., Barnlund &amp; Yoshioka, 1990; Kumagai, 1993). In terms of complaints, the J1 speakers were overall slightly more indirect and mitigated than the E1 speakers. In terms of learner performances, the J2Ls' performed rather poorly, while the J2Hs' role-plays closely approximated those produced by the J1s both quantitatively and qualitatively as well as grammatically and pragmatically. Both the J2Ls and the J2Hs showed signs of negative pragmatic transfer from their L1 in several common features, but overall the J2Hs exhibited less negative pragmatic transfer than the J2Ls. The interactive role-plays thus proved to be an effective means to investigate the participants' pragmatic competence.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/interlanguage-speech-act-realization-apologies/docview/305346758/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Results from a contextualized production task indicate that beginning learners transferred the SV order of English for all structures. Intermediate learners showed a gradual increase in the production of lexically and discourse-determined inversion, although their data was also characterized by indeterminacy and variability. The advanced learners demonstrated a sensitivity to the word order effects of unaccusativity and discourse factors, but also tended to overgeneralize inversion to unergative verbs in a neutral discourse context.", Journal Article,10.1191/0267658303sr224oa,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/lexical-discourse-factors-second-language/docview/200202649/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Tanaka, Junko",1999.0,Implicit /explicit learning of focus marking in Japanese as a foreign language: A case of learning through output and negative feedback,"This dissertation investigates effects of output and negative feedback (NF) on the learning of a conceptually complex target language domain: the morphosyntactic marking of focus using the particle ga in argument-focus identificational sentences. Research in cognitive psychology and linguistics suggests that output and NF that makes use of metalinguistic explanation help second language (L2) learners to attend to relevant form-meaning relations in the target domain. This hypothesis was tested experimentally. Participants were 52 adult learners of Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) whose first languages (Lls), mostly English and Chinese, do not mark focus morphologically. A computer-assisted L2 learning and testing environment was set up. The experiment was carried out individually in three sessions and lasted for about 20 days. Interventions happened only once, at the beginning of the experiment. Learners' accuracy was tracked during the training and the five tests, and the relationship between their accuracy and certainty was tracked at the beginning and the end of each session. The results of the study demonstrated a clear effect of NF that includes metalinguistic information. NF affected the accuracy of participants' L2 construction, and accuracy in turn affected certainty in their estimate of their answers' correctness. NF appears to increase the salience of the critical features of complex concepts. Explicit learning through such NF is thus argued to have educational benefits for adult L2 learners, and may be necessary for those whose Ll lacks a surface form functionally similar to that of the L2. Output production was also demonstrated to facilitate adult L2 learning of complex concepts, although its effects were slow to emerge. The semantic content of noun phrases (NPs) differentially affected the difficulty of acquiring a syntactic structure that included them: the more typical such NPs are as topic, the more difficult it was for learners to use them as focus elements and to mark them with ga in argument focus sentences. Taken together, these results support the overall pedagogical benefits of explicit learning of complex concepts, especially for learners whose L Is are more likely to cause negative transfer to the L2 and who are in FL learning contexts.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/implicit-explicit-learning-focus-marking-japanese/docview/304570334/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Taniguchi, Sumiko",2009.0,Becoming Bilingual: Exploring Language and Literacy Learning Through the Lens of Narrative,"In this thesis, I investigate the nature of change that two adult language learners/users have experienced in learning to become bilingual through the mediation of autobiographical narrative writing. The major purposes of the thesis are to identify the nature of change that adult language learners/users have experienced in learning and using plural languages through the mediation of autobiographical writing in L2, and to examine the usefulness of narrative inquiry as a complementary research approach to understand the complexity of language and literacy learning from the learner‘s perspectives. To this end the following research questions have been posed. 1. What can learners‘ stories tell about the long-term processes of language and literacy learning? 2. What role can written autobiographical narrative play in processes of language learning? 3. What is the potential contribution of narrative inquiry to research in the field of language and literacy learning? In addressing these questions, I have drawn on socio-cultural and narrative theory to undertake a longitudinal study of two language learners/users – Satoko, a young Chinese-Japanese woman, and myself. Thus, the study comprises Satoko‘s biographical study and my own autobiographical study, in which I am simultaneously the subject and the object of inquiry. I have analysed how processes of becoming bilingual for both of us were represented in autobiographical narratives, and, in turn, how the act of writing autobiographical narratives mediated ways in which we learned to become bilingual. By utilising narrative inquiry, I have attempted to broaden the locus of research into language and literacy learning from language development to learner development. A feature of the research design implemented in the thesis is its layered approach to narrative construction and analysis. This approach has enabled me to provide detailed insights into the complex interrelationships between linguistic and non-linguistic dimensions of language learning. In particular it has enabled me to highlight the multifaceted nature of learners‘ change and the significance of affect, social relations, and transformation of identities as learners work between two languages. It has also enabled me to address ways in which learners‘ engagement with written narrative impacted both their linguistic and non-linguistic development. Outcomes from the research suggest that complex processes of language and literacy learning can be profitably examined through the notion of becoming bilingual, which entails continuous translation across languages – hence the use of the term becoming bilingual in the title of this thesis.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/becoming-bilingual-exploring-language-literacy/docview/3039731806/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Tateyama, Yumiko",2008.0,Learning to request in Japanese through foreign language classroom instruction,"This study examines the effects of instructional practices on Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) learners' pragmatic competence in learning how to request in Japanese. It also investigates how instructional effects are displayed depending on the type of outcome measure (Jeon &amp; Kaya, 2006). A preliminary study, conducted prior to the main study in order to investigate strengths and weaknesses of JFL learners of different proficiency levels when requesting in Japanese, showed that the learners had difficulties with opening and closing moves, request strategies, and the sociopragmatic aspects of requesting. These findings were incorporated into the instructional materials for the main study. The participants in the main study were JFL learners enrolled in fourth-semester university-level Japanese courses. Two classes (Regular group, N=22 ) received regular explicit instruction on requests following a course syllabus, while two others (Expanded group, N=24 ) received additional pragmatics instruction. The effect of instruction was measured through four outcome measures that involved request-making situations: discourse completion task (DCT), telephone message task, role play task and video clip rating task. The data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. A significant instructional effect was revealed in the telephone and role play tasks. Moreover, the learners performed significantly better in the role play than in the telephone task, which was attributed to the presence of the interlocutor who offered repairs to ratify the learners' requestive intent or candidate understanding. This finding suggests that interactive versus non-interactive tasks might differentially affect the learning outcome. A relatively large instructional effect was found in the video task which examined the learners' metapragmatic awareness. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the number of conventionally indirect strategies in the post-test DCT, telephone and role play tasks that examined learners' use of request strategies. This suggests that instructional effects manifest in a similar manner regardless of the type of outcome measure. Overall, there was no significant difference between the groups.

"Thomas, Margaret Ann",1991.0,Universal Grammar and knowledge of reflexives in a second language,"This thesis addresses the debate about whether adult language learners have access to the principles and parameters of universal grammar (UG) in constructing the grammar of a foreign or second language (L2). A comprehension task investigates the interpretation of English reflexive pronouns by native speakers of Japanese and of Spanish (n = 132), and the interpretation of the Japanese reflexive zibun by native speakers of English and of Chinese (n = 42). The experimental stimuli include single- and bi-clausal sentences, sentences in which the anaphor appears inside an NP with a lexical subject, and sentences which test whether learners require c-commanding antecedents for reflexives. I evaluate the predictions of three hypotheses about the role of universal grammar in L2 acquisition: (A) that UG is unavailable, and that processing strategies or other non-linguistic principles guide L2 acquisition; (B) that UG is available only in the form in which it is instantiated in the learner's native language; (C) that UG is fully available, including the ability to re-set parameters in L2 to UG-sanctioned values not instantiated in the learner's native language. The results show that learners observe constraints defined by Manzini and Wexler's (1987) parameterized version of Principle A of the binding theory, constraints which learners could not have derived solely from inspection of the input data, nor from the treatment of anaphors in their native languages. Thus these results support the proposal that adult learners have access to universal grammar in their interpretations of anaphors in L2.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/universal-grammar-knowledge-reflexives-second/docview/303928716/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Thoms, Joshua J.",2008.0,Teacher -initiated talk and student oral discourse in a second language literature classroom: A sociocultural analysis,"For students studying foreign languages at the college level in the United States, developing second language (L2) speaking abilities can be a difficult task. As students progress through the sequence of foreign language coursework and continue their studies in upper-level courses that primarily focus on the teaching of literature, they often confront a number of challenges that can hinder the ongoing development of their L2 oral ability. Furthermore, instructors teaching upper-level L2 literature courses rely a great deal on whole-class discussions. Little is known about the ways in which whole-class discussions unfold between instructors and their students in L2 literature courses, and few studies have attempted to understand oral discourse in this context at a micro-level of analysis. The study employed macro- and micro-levels of analysis to understand the dynamics of teacher-initiated whole-class discussions in a college-level Latin American literature classroom from a sociocultural theoretical perspective while also drawing on ecological linguistic views of language learning. Macro-level views of discourse included an analysis of the instructor's and students' goals, expectations, and intentions regarding the course. Micro-level views of talk focused on the linguistic structures that emerged in classroom talk. The results indicate that both the instructor and her students entered the course with a wide range of course goals and expectations. The resulting tensions between instructor and student goals influenced the interaction patterns observed in the data. Analysis also revealed that interaction-response-feedback patterns were more present when compared to interaction-response-evaluation patterns. Micro-level analysis revealed that meaning was made via affordances that emerged in the talk. Three distinct discourse patterns in the talk, termed affordance structures, were identified to mitigate the conflicting goals indicated by the instructor and her students. This study's results deepen our understanding of microgenesis via the affordance construct.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/teacher-initiated-talk-student-oral-discourse/docview/304607906/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Thomson, Gregory Edward",2000.0,Second language acquisition and comprehension mechanisms: The problem of Russian inflectional morphology,"Acquiring grammatical form is typically considered central to second language acquisition (SLA), and assumed to involve the development of an internal grammar, i.e., a mental apparatus that characterizes the form of sentences in the second language (L2). An alternative assumed here is to view linguistic forms as processing triggers and SLA as learning to detect and react to such triggers (and then to produce comparable ones). Inflectional cue systems are inherently complex, combining lexical cues and grammatical cues in phonological words. They are complex in their formal nature, in the sets of processes that they trigger, and in the relationships between the two. Thus, it should not be surprising that L2 inflection is often not readily acquired. This dissertation first sketches a broad picture of language processing, next explores the nature of inflectional morphology, and then proceeds to an experimental investigation into whether various categories of inflectional morphology are active or inert in the comprehension systems of ninety-one adult learners of Russian as a second language, representing two developmental levels (along with twenty-five native Russian control participants). Sensitivity to inflectional errors (and by implication, to particular features of inflectional form) was investigated under three conditions: (1)&#xa0;meaning-oriented listening; (2)&#xa0;form-oriented listening; (3)&#xa0;free examination of printed sentence. Evidence emerges that systematic acquisition of inflectional morphology does take place in learners of L2 Russian. However, the developmental process would appear to be so protracted that complete acquisition may be a rarity. Explicit metalinguistic knowledge of L2 grammar may allow some learners to simulate many features of nativelike production when the relevant strictly linguistic developments may still be years away. Implications are discussed in relation to various SLA models and research approaches.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-comprehension/docview/304646102/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

Since findings in CA describe systematic action sequences underlying verbal activities that display cross-cultural variation, they capture pragmatics in its most natural locus: the conversational encounter. It will furthermore be demonstrated that L2 learners may benefit from instruction with CA-based materials with the ability to anticipate, interpret and produce, socio-pragmatically appropriate verbal behaviour in the target language. CA-based materials thus provide a rich resource for language teachers based on solid empirical evidence, and effectively enable L2 learners to engage in cross-culturally variable language behaviour inside and outside of class.",,10.1191/1362168806lr184oa,https://doi.org/10.1191/1362168806lr184oa,ancestry
"Tokuda, Miho",2001.0,L2 learners' perceptions of politeness in Japanese: The evaluations on non-native speaker in L2 Japanese,"The present study assesses pragmalinguistic knowledge of learners of Japanese as a second/foreign language in terms of linguistic politeness in non-native speaker requests in Japanese. Some dimensions of the participants' evaluations were taken into consideration and the learners' evaluations were compared with native speakers'. Significant differences were found in the evaluations between the learners and the native speakers. Most of those differences depended on speech style; speech style was a significant factor in the evaluations as well. The intermediate learners perceived little difference in the degree of politeness in the stimuli, whereas the advanced learners' evaluations showed trends similar to those of the native speakers'. Appropriate use of honorifics, formal forms, donative auxiliary verbs, and formulaic expressions positively influenced the evaluations. However, the inappropriate use of honorifics and informal style, and disfluency caused mainly by hesitation markers had mixed effects on the evaluations. In some cases, the learners were negatively influenced, but the native speakers were positively influenced. In other cases, reversed results were obtained. To further the understanding of the learners' pragmatic knowledge, a sociopragmatic assessment was conducted as well. Significant differences were found among participant groups in their evaluations of a speaker's right to make requests and a hearer's obligation to comply with the requests. However, those differences depended on the request type. In addition, significant correlations were found between the participants' pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic assessments, which indicates a relationship between the evaluations of linguistic politeness and degree of imposition of the requests.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/l2-learners-perceptions-politeness-japanese/docview/304698496/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

I advocate bilingual education that aims at students' bilingualism and biliteracy as a means to approach an ideal of multilingualism and multiculturalism in school. In this global era, mainstream schools serve an increasing number of children from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and are faced with the problems of minority students' academic failure. Thus, as the need for bilingual education that addresses these issues increases, research on bilingual education that provides pedagogical insights on educational practices is imminent and necessary. In this study, I will investigate the pedagogical practices at an English-Japanese bilingual school in Japan. This small but unique school, run by a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization, was established by parents in Okinawa in 1998, in order to empower Amerasian children through the means of bilingual/bicultural education. I will look at the practices of the first-grade English- and Japanese-medium classrooms and examine how young children participated in lessons and play. It is my goal that this study will add to the scholarship on bilingual education and second language learning as well as work to inform educational practices involving children from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/we-are-all-stars-ethnographic-study-first-grade/docview/2581042021/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tomita, Hideo",1995.0,Identifying and explaining L2 learners' difficulties: A case of the Japanese particles WA and GA,"The usage of the Japanese particles WA or GA are notoriously difficult for teachers to teach and for learners to master. Linguistic classification of these particles is helpful only in a limited way. Tomita (1994) suggests that the usage is difficult to generalize because there are many cases that either particle is possible. He observes that there are at least three types of linguistic contexts for WA and GA: (1) GA only, (2) WA only, and (3) cases where the selection is left with the writer/speaker. Tomita and Hiki (1994) empirically confirmed this observation with 100 native speakers of Japanese who showed various degrees of variability in selecting the particles, including two cases of complete split judgement. This dissertation is a continuation of the above studies with L2 Japanese learners. It investigated the effect of linguistic ""cues"" that were hypothesized to affect the selection of the Japanese particles WA and GA in a cloze test. Following Kail (1989), two major types of cues were assumed: local cues and global (Kail's topological) cues. It was hypothesized that the selection of WA or GA involving global cues would be more difficult and acquired later than those involving local cues because the former would require a larger amount of cross-referencing for interpretation to occur than do the latter. A cloze test was administered with 35 adult L2 Japanese learners at a university in the U.S. There were three independent variables: cue type (local vs. global), particle type (WA vs. GA) and proficiency level (2nd, 3rd regular, 3rd intensive, and 4th year level). The dependent variable was incorrect response score. The results indicated with statistically significant differences that subjects made more mistakes with global cues than local cues, and with GA than WA. The difference in proficiency level was not statistically significant and no interaction among the variables was observed. The overall result was interpreted to indicate that the global environment manifested itself as a major source of difficulty, providing a new focus for research and teaching of WA and GA.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/identifying-explaining-l2-learners-difficulties/docview/304230049/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Tomiyama, Yoshiko",2009.0,Progress in acquisition of Japanese discourse structures from intermediate to advanced level learners,"Although there have been many studies examining the acquisition of grammar in Japanese as a second language (L2) (e.g., Nagatomo, 1993; Noda, Sakoda, Shibuya, &amp; Kobayashi, 2001), discourse analysis research on the L2 acquisition of Japanese discourse structure is still in its infancy. This study examines how L2 learners organize their spoken discourse, and how spoken discourse by learners of Japanese changes as they develop proficiency, from intermediate to advanced levels, using interview and casual conversation data. The study found that although mid-intermediate learners used zero referential forms with ease, they still had difficulty effectively utilizing pronouns and demonstratives to refer to the preceding context. In contrast, high-intermediate learners showed an increase in the utilization of both demonstratives and pronouns. As for personal referents, omitting personal referential forms was easily employed by the intermediate level of Japanese, and the use of zero personal referential forms increased as at higher proficiencies. In addition, the study revealed that 'sentences without subjects' and 'full sentences' were the two most frequently used structures analyzed in the casual conversation data. Also, with higher proficiency, full sentences decreased while sentences without subjects increased. Furthermore, the results showed that the higher the learners' proficiency was, the more frequently they used postposing, a specific feature in spoken Japanese. Different types of postposing were used depending on the learner's proficiency level. In sum, there were gradual shifts in use of the referential forms and discourse structures depending on the learner's proficiency.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/progress-acquisition-japanese-discourse/docview/304849840/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Torres, Jenna Patrice",2003.0,A cognitive approach to the acquisition of clitics in L2 Spanish: Insights from study abroad and classroom learners,"Clitics in Spanish, which include the direct and indirect object pronouns, reflexives, and middle markers, are a notorious source of difficulty for second language learners. This dissertation examines how learners use and acquire clitics according to their functions over time, and attempts to identify the cognitive processes and language use strategies responsible for the patterns during acquisition. In addition, it examines the role of the learning context via a comparison of classroom learners to study abroad learners. The data consist of conversational discourse from fifteen L2 learners (L1 English, ten study abroad and five classroom-only) over one semester, from proficiency levels ranging from novice high to advanced low. The analysis of clitics is divided into three parts: (1)&#xa0;a morphosyntactic profile of clitics, pronouns, and zeros; (2)&#xa0;a functional analysis of clitics versus other NP types in creating information flow and maintaining reference via the preferred argument structure framework of Du Bois (1987); and (3)&#xa0;an analysis of semantic categories of verbs marked and not marked with middle voice clitics. The results demonstrate that lower level learners rarely use clitics and prefer zeros, while the intermediate mid learners begin with first person clitics in a one-to-one form-function connection, followed by the addition of third person clitics in a more mulitfunctional manner. There were few contexts for clitics overall compared to native speaker use. The preferred argument structure analysis indicates that the reasons for the lack of clitics is the overuse of full NPs as objects and obliques, a preference for intransitive and copula constructions, and a lack of variety of transitive verbs overall. The third analysis indicates that initially middle constructions are formulaic, followed by the use of prototypical semantic categories involved with motion and change. Other, less prototypical uses appear at upper levels. Finally, for clitic accuracy and use study abroad does not appear to have much linguistic benefit over classroom learning; its benefits come at the discourse and pragmatic level. Study abroad learners have more native-like patterns of NP distribution, can accomplish more with their language, and improve their proficiency level to a greater degree.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/cognitive-approach-acquisition-clitics-l2-spanish/docview/305337961/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Trofimovich, Pavel;Baker, Wendy",2006.0,LEARNING SECOND LANGUAGE SUPRASEGMENTALS: Effect of L2 Experience on Prosody and Fluency Characteristics of L2 Speech,"This study examines effects of short, medium, and extended second language (L2) experience (3 months, 3 years, and 10 years of United States residence, respectively) on the production of five suprasegmentals (stress timing, peak alignment, speech rate, pause frequency, and pause duration) in six English declarative sentences by 30 adult Korean learners of English and 10 adult native English speakers. Acoustic analyses and listener judgments were used to determine how accurately the suprasegmentals were produced and to what extent they contributed to foreign accent. Results revealed that amount of experience influenced the production of one suprasegmental (stress timing), whereas adult learners' age at the time of first extensive exposure to the L2 (indexed as age of arrival in the United States) influenced the production of others (speech rate, pause frequency, pause duration). Moreover, it was found that suprasegmentals contributed to foreign accent at all levels of experience and that some suprasegmentals (pause duration, speech rate) were more likely to do so than others (stress timing, peak alignment). Overall, results revealed similarities between L2 segmental and suprasegmental learning.

"Ueyama, Motoko",2000.0,Prosodic transfer: An acoustic study of L2 English vs. L2 Japanese,"The effect of L1 characteristics on L2 speech has been investigated extensively at the segmental level. This dissertation investigates how L1 prosodic features affect L2 prosodic patterns in the production of the adult L2 speaker (i.e., prosodic transfer ). Four speech types were analyzed: (1)&#xa0;L2 English produced by L1 Japanese speakers; (2)&#xa0;L2 Japanese produced by L1 English speakers; (3)&#xa0;L1 English; (4)&#xa0;L1 Japanese. This comparison is interesting, since Japanese and English are typologically very different in terms of their prosodic properties: e.g., English has stress accents, while Japanese has pitch accents; Japanese has a phonemic length contrast, while English does not; English is a stress-timed language, while Japanese is a mora-timed language. Seven phonetic experiments were conducted to investigate three prosodic phenomena: (1)&#xa0;the contrast between lexically accented and unaccented vowels (Experiments 1–3); (2)&#xa0;the contrast between English tense vs. lax vowels and between Japanese short vs. long vowels (Experiments 4 and 5); (3)&#xa0;the temporal organization across syllables (Experiments 6 and 7). Prosody is phonetically realized by multiple acoustic correlates, which differ from language to language. In the analysis of the collected data, various correlates relevant to each of the three prosodic phenomena were analyzed, taking both phonological and phonetic aspects into account. Additionally, a survey testing phonological awareness of L2 syllable structure was conducted. The results of the survey were analyzed together with the results of the phonetic experiments. The results supported the following generalizations: first, the transfer patterns of L1 prosodic features in L2 prosody can vary greatly from correlate to correlate. Second, different transfer patterns in the learner's production can be explained by a difference between L1 and L2 in terms of the phonological status of a relevant prosodic feature. Third, there is a systematic interaction between the prosodic and segmental levels in the transfer of L1 features in L2 speech development. Finally, an L2 speaker's prosodic system does not necessarily develop in a parallel manner for different dimensions of prosody.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/prosodic-transfer-acoustic-study-l2-english-vs/docview/304582382/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
"Umeda, Mari",2008.0,Second language acquisition of Japanese wh -constructions,"This dissertation investigates the second language (L2) acquisition of Japanese wh-constructions by Chinese- and English-speaking learners. The focus of this study is twofold; first, it examines whether parameter resetting is possible in L2 acquisition, as both Chinese and English wh-constructions are parametrically different from Japanese wh-constructions. Second, it examines whether parameter resetting is affected by the learners' first language (L1). Not only do Chinese and English wh-constructions differ from Japanese wh-constructions, but they also differ from each other. Chinese is, like Japanese, a wh-in-situ language, while English is a wh-movement language. Chinese wh-constructions, therefore, can be said to be more similar to Japanese wh-constructions than English wh-constructions. It is investigated whether the similarity between Chinese and Japanese and dissimilarity between English and Japanese affect the course and/or the ultimate attainment in the acquisition of wh-constructions in Japanese. Fifty-two Chinese and 32 English speakers, who were at intermediate and advanced levels, as well as 12 native speakers of Japanese, took part in the study, taking tests designed to examine their interpretations of Japanese wh-phrases. The results showed that the acquisition of targetlike knowledge of Japanese wh-constructions is possible, as evidenced by some advanced learners. However, it was also found that many learners, both at the intermediate and the advanced levels, failed to interpret wh-phrases in Japanese in a targetlike way, showing no evidence of parameter resetting. The results also showed that there was no L1 difference at the intermediate level, but at the advanced level, English-speaking learners outperformed their Chinese counterparts. The present study showed that acquiring L2 wh-constructions with a different parametric value from the learners' L1 is possible, as demonstrated by some advanced learners. However, it was also found that acquiring targetlike interpretations of wh-phrases in Japanese is difficult, and that it is only after extensive exposure and attainment of high proficiency that targetlike interpretations can be achieved. The present study also demonstrated that the typological similarity between Chinese and Japanese does not play a role in the L2 acquisition of Japanese wh-constructions. An alternative view of L1 influence to account for the out-performance by English speakers is proposed.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/second-language-acquisition-japanese-wh/docview/304351812/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
V. Cook,1992.0,Evidence for Multicompetence,"The term multicompetence describes “the compound state of a mind with two grammars” (Cook, 1991a, p. 112). This paper reviews evidence addressing two questions: 1. Do people who know two languages differ from people who know only one in other respects than simply knowledge of an L2? L2 users differ from monolinguals in L1 knowledge; advanced L2 users differ from monolinguals in L2 knowledge; L2 usershave a different metalinguistic awareness from monolinguals; L2 users have different cognitive processes. These subtle differences consistently suggest that people with multicompetence are not simply equivalent to two monolinguals but are a unique combination. 2. Do people who know two languages have a merged language system rather than two separate systems? The L1 and L2 share the same mentallexicon; L2 users codeswitch readily; L2 processing cannot be cut off from LI; both languages are stored in the same areas of the brain; L2 proficiency relates to L1 proficiency. This evidence suggests merged systems at some level in some areas, even if some of it is open to other interpretations. 
A final section discusses more general issues. Much SLA research is biased by adopting the monolingual as a norm rather than the multicompetent speaker. Multicompetence distinguishes diachronic transfer during the learner's acquisition from synchronic transfer between the two languages at a single moment of time. Multicompetence starts when there is systematic knowledge of an L2 that is not assimilated to the L1. Holistic multicompetence is seen as an offshoot of polylectal grammar theory applied to monolinguals. Language teaching should try to produce multicompetent individuals not ersatz native speakers.",,10.1111/J.1467-1770.1992.TB01044.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-1770.1992.TB01044.X,ancestry

"Wade, Travis William",2003.0,Acoustic variability and perceptual learning of nonnative -accented speech sounds,"The present study seeks to answer the questions of whether and how listeners may come to recognize nonnative-accented speech sounds as a result of formal training, and what impact the acoustic variability of non-native productions has on their learnability, in order to address the larger issue of how humans deal with unpredictability in the instantiations of categories during perceptual learning. In a high-variability, identification-with-feedback training study, it was observed that subjects do not respond to this type of training on accented words in the same way that they have been previously shown to with native-produced words. Trainees demonstrated adaptation to individual Spanish-accented speakers they encountered during training but showed no recognition advantages that were transferable to productions of other Spanish-accented speakers. An acoustic study comparing the accented vowel sounds included in the training study with a parallel set of native-produced sounds revealed a robust increase in variability in nonnatives' use of the perceptual vowel space, involving larger, less regular distributions and greater category overlap. In an additional training study where types and degree of variability in the use of vowel space were controlled artificially, subjects exposed to words with vowel distributions defined by variability typical of that observed in non-native productions did not improve in recognition accuracy over the course of learning as subjects exposed to lower levels of variability did. Post-training recognition of highly-varied sounds was not effected overall by the level of variability of training, though differences were observed in subjects' sensitivity to certain individual vowels. Results are discussed with respect to an exemplar model of perceptual learning, which it is suggested does not entirely account for the perception of accented speech.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acoustic-variability-perceptual-learning/docview/305318348/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

The purpose of the study is to investigate the similarities and differences in back channel behavior by Thais and Americans in terms of frequency, types, locations and functions. Gender was also studied to see if it was related to back channel behavior. The data consisted of 10 hours of telephone discourse collected from 60 same-sex dyads, 30 American and 30 Thai pairs. The results suggest that there were both similarities and differences in the two language groups. The data revealed that Thais employed back channels more frequently than Americans did but the difference existed only between the male groups. The overwhelming majority of back channels in both groups fell within the short utterance category. The second and third most used categories were laughter and short questions. Brief restatements and sentence completions were the fourth and fifth last choices respectively. In terms of the location of back channels, the only thing Thais and Americans had in common was the location where back channels occurred the most, clausal units. The discourse environment which was used significantly more by Thais than Americans was after clausal units, whereas the environments which were used significantly more by Americans than Thais included during speech lap and after conjunctions. The study also showed that in both groups the most frequently displayed function of back channel was understanding. Showing emotional response was the second most frequent reason for use. The third and fourth most displayed functions for Thais were asking for clarification and display of agreement whereas for Americans they were display of agreement and asking for clarification. The least common function in both groups was that of continuer. In both languages short utterances tended to show understanding, short questions to request clarification, and laughter to display emotional response. In Thai brief restatements were likely to show agreement whereas in American English sentence completions were related to the function of understanding.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/back-channel-behavior-thai-american-casual/docview/304345276/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Xu, Yi",2009.0,"The syntax, processing and second language acquisition of Chinese relative clauses","The structural complexity and the typological universals associated with relative clauses (RCs) have made the structure particularly interesting to linguists and second language acquisition (SLA) researchers. Currently, much controversy is found in RCs in East Asian Languages. This dissertation tests the syntactic status of ""relative clauses"" in Chinese and explores second language (L2) learners' processing and production of different types of Chinese RCs. In the theoretical part of the dissertation, I test whether Comrie (2002)'s proposal of analyzing putative relative clauses in East Asian languages as ""attributive clauses"" can be applicable to Chinese. From a review of syntactic literature and movement test, I argue that there are crucial differences between Chinese RCs and attributive clauses. Further, reconstruction effect suggests that A-bar movement takes place within gapped Chinese RCs. More specifically, following Sauerland (2000)'s proposal, I suggest that the derivation of Chinese RCs involves the movement of an operator taking a complex NP as its complement to the Spec of CP, and that complex NP matches with an external head outside the RC. Further, I examine the possibility of analyzing AdjP+DE structure as relative clauses, and examine the flexibility and effect of demonstrative and numeral-classifier positions and their relation with relative clauses. In the experiment chapter, I discuss results from three experiments that tested the relative degrees of difficulty for L2 learners among different types of RCs including Subject, Direct Object, Indirect Object and Object of Preposition relative clauses, I seek plausible linguistic and psycholinguistic proposals in explaining the performance data. The experiments include a self-paced word order judgment task, a written sentence completion task, and a written sentence combination task. It was found that the L2 acquisition of Chinese RCs is generally consistent with the Noun Phrase Accessibility Hierarchy (Keenan &amp; Comrie, 1977), a typological generalization based on natural languages and a hierarchy that was found to be predictive of learners’ order of acquisition in SLA studies of many other languages.

The target feature of the treatment sessions was the '""oblique"" relative clause that is considered to be a marked type in the NPAH, and I examined whether formal instruction that focused on a marked type could facilitate the learning of other relative clause types. Results of comprehension and sentence-combination pretests and posttests showed that although the scores of all three groups increased, the form-based treatment group outperformed the other two on both tests. While the comprehension pretest results did not reflect the predictions of the NPAH, participants were able to generalize rules for other relativization types. This study suggests that in this context, adult second language (L2) learners' attention to detailed analysis of form facilitates the comprehension and production of relative clauses, and that the teaching of marked items may inform effective syllabus development in relativization for adult JFL and, potentially, other L2 classes.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigating-role-form-focused-instruction/docview/304750582/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

While acknowledging these contributions, this paper asks if the conceptual formulation of communicative competence has other relevancies for our understanding of the realities of language use in L2 instructional settings. Classroom interaction itself is an occasion of language use that relies on the competence of the parties to the interaction; the competence that is already in the room is then a constitutive feature of the work-practices of teaching and learning. Informed by Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis, this paper proposes that communicative competence may be as much the condition of L2 instruction, one that makes L2 instruction possible in the first place, as its target outcome. Brief analyses of transcripts from ESL classrooms are offered to demonstrate how the communicative competence found in L2 classrooms is a contingent resource for language teaching and learning.",,10.1093/APPLIN/AML011,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/AML011,ancestry

"Yoshinori J. Fukuya, Alicia Martínez-Flor",2008.0,The Interactive Effects of Pragmatic-Eliciting Tasks and Pragmatic Instruction,": the effects of data-gathering methods on pragmatic data have been well documented, yet an inquiry into the interactive effects of assessment tasks with pragmatic instruction has received scant attention. This study investigated the interaction between two assessment tasks (e-mail and phone) and two types of pragmatic instruction (explicit and implicit). Forty-nine Spanish learners of English engaged in these two tasks as pre- and posttests. The explicit group received 12 hours of metapragmatic information on head acts and hedges in suggestions while the implicit group was the recipient of recast and input enhancement activities. The results showed that postin-structional improvement of the explicit condition was significantly more than that of the implicit condition in the phone task, although improvements of these two conditions were on par in the e-mail task. This task-induced variability might have been caused by an interaction between the feature of the two types of knowledge (i.e., monitoring capability) and an access to the knowledge bases (i.e., the role of attention to appropriateness and accuracy) in the two tasks.",,10.1111/J.1944-9720.2008.TB03308.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1944-9720.2008.TB03308.X,ancestry

Some words of exploration are necessary here for selecting grammatical features for inVestigation, rather than other properties of language use, such as pragmatics. This selection does not imply that such other features are of secondary value in curriculum design or syllabus construction, Obviously, various properties of target language and language use, sociolinguistic and pragmatic among others, deserve serious consideration in designing a curriculum, However, a psycho linguistically motivated acquisition model with implications for syllabus construction has great potential value to effectively fill the vacuum that exists between theories and the actual classroom. Such an effort to bridge the gap have long been waited for, which justifies the focus of this thesis.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquisition-japanese-particles-effort-test/docview/2460105614/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
Yuan-Shan Chen,2009.0,Learner Perceptions of Instruction in L2 Pragmatics,"In Taiwan, pragmatic competence has often been a neglected area in English education. Learners may be linguistically competent, but do not know how to use L2 appropriately. Through the teaching of complaint behaviors, the author demonstrates how pragmatic components can be incorporated into a college-level language classroom. After the instruction, the self reports of the forty participants showed a positive attitude toward such instruction. They also reported that the teaching materials were suitable, but suggested that the instruction would have been more interesting if videos or films had been included. When it comes to learning difficulties, most learners reported that more instructional time was needed to turn knowledge about L2 complaints to actual productions. These findings can serve as offering advice to language teachers when they plan their lessons in L2 pragmatics.",,10.5539/ELT.V2N4P154,https://doi.org/10.5539/ELT.V2N4P154,forward

"Yumoto, Kazuko",2004.0,A Study of Cognitive Level of Bilingual Proficiency: What Makes Balanced Bilinguals?,"This is an on-going study to investigate bilingual proficiency of Japanese children living abroad. The research centers on bilingual proficiency in relation to age of arrival, length of stay, and language use at home in order to find out factors leading to balanced bilinguals. The project was conducted in Vancouver, Canada in 2001. This paper reports the results of the Oral Proficiency Assessment for Bilingual Children (OBC) developed by Canadian Association for Japanese Language Education. The OBC interview tests aim to examine Japanese and English proficiencies in three dimensions: basic, communicative, and cognitive. The objectives of the paper are: 1) to present the results of L1/L2 proficiencies of Vancouver survey on balanced bilinguals as case studies; 2) to find out factors leading to cognitive/academic language proficiency; and 3) to verify Cummins' L1/L2 interdependent hypothesis and threshold hypothesis. Subjects are 17 Japanese children with the age range of 6-12 years old who study English as L2 at Canadian schools during weekdays and study L1 at the Japanese School on Saturday as heritage program. Following factors are proposed for CALP acquisition: L1 use at home, amount of reading in L1/L2, motivation for language learning, positive attitude, and socio-cultural interests.", Journal Article,,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/study-cognitive-level-bilingual-proficiency-what/docview/2266449763/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Zimmerman, Erica Lea",2007.0,Identity constructions of users of Japanese: Interculturality in talk,"Utilizing an applied Conversation Analysis approach, this study examines how identity and interculturality are constructed in talk by participants who are Korean learners of Japanese at a university in Japan. The analysis of audio recordings of naturally occurring conversations reveals that the participants, on occasion, orient to intercultural statuses in talk in two contexts: (1)&#xa0;narrating experiences and (2)&#xa0;talk about language. The findings indicate that in these data, there were three possible combinations for indicating one's interculturality in talk. First, in some examples, participants indicated their intercultural and ethnic memberships and worked to arrive at some sort of understanding about each other's culture. Second, some interactions demonstrated that participants may orient to intercultural topics of talk and arrive at a shared understanding without making their own ethnic membership categorization relevant for that bit of talk. Finally, the participants may mention their ethnic and linguistic membership categorizations and affiliations as a part of the point-making process of their talk, but the talk is not about arriving at a greater intercultural understanding. This study reveals that interculturality is not found in special moments in the participants' lives, rather, these moments permeate everyday interactions. The participants make use of the interactional resources to construct interculturality when it is the most efficient and appropriate method to manage their world—they do not orient to interculturality simply because they are from a certain culture or ethnicity, as has been explained in research examining so called non-native speakers or learners of Japanese.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/identity-constructions-users-japanese/docview/304847068/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest
Zohreh Eslami-Rasekh,2005.0,Raising the pragmatic awareness of language learners,"The development of pragmatic and sociolinguistic rules of language use is important for language learners. It is necessary to understand and create language that is appropriate to the situations in which one is functioning, because failure to do so may cause users to miss key points that are being communicated or to have their messages misunderstood. Worse yet is the possibility of a total communication breakdown and the stereotypical labelling of second language users as people who are insensitive, rude, or inept (Thomas 1983). In this paper I will discuss different approaches to teaching pragmatics, and, based on my teaching experiences, I will provide some strategies that can be used to raise the pragmatic awareness of English language learners (ELLs).",,10.1093/ELT/CCI039,https://doi.org/10.1093/ELT/CCI039,ancestry

Zohreh R. Eslami,2005.0,Invitations in Persian and English: Ostensible or genuine?,"Abstract The present study describes the defining features of Persian genuine and ostensible invitations based on a collection of spontaneous Persian invitations and the results of interview data. The results are compared with the structure of invitations in English reported by Isaacs and Clark (1990). The framework for data collection and data analysis designed by Isaacs and Clark and their results were used in this study. Our results show that the structure of ostensible invitations in Persian is more complex than in English. The features suggested for ostensible invitations in English are present, but these are not sufficient to distinguish ostensible invitations from genuine invitations in Persian. Invitations that meet the criteria for being genuine invitations in English can be classified as ostensible by Persian speakers. In contrast to the claim made by Isaacs and Clark regarding English speakers that ‘‘ostensible invitations are rare in most situations’’ (p. 494), our observations show that Persian speakers use a considerable number of ostensible invitations in their daily activities as a manifestation of ritual politeness (ta’arof ). The study concludes that enhancing face (Brown & Levinson 1987) for both interlocutors is the main underlying factor in using ostensible invitations in Persian. In Persian, the speaker, in adhering to societal norms, enhances his / her face as well as that of his / her interlocutor by using ostensible invitations in everyday language.",,10.1515/iprg.2005.2.4.453,https://doi.org/10.1515/iprg.2005.2.4.453,ancestry

"Zuck, Gregory V.",1998.0,Elements of a child's second language maintenance in her first language environment: A case study of Aika,"The purpose of this study was to assess the degree of improvement, maintenance or loss of particular L2 features by a child L2 speaker who was reimmersed in her first language environment. The study focused on the participant's accuracy, during spontaneous conversational interaction, in the use of (a) verb inflections for tense, aspect and number; (b) genitive (possessive) lexical items and (-s) form; (c) number (singular and plural) marking; (d) copula verb ('is/are'); (e) negation patterns; and (f) interrogative patterns. Additionally, the participant's semantic use of the verb 'do' was assessed as a potential indicator of specific L2 lexical item loss, and the participant's overall use of discourse compensation strategies were assessed as potential indicators of overall L2 loss. The participant was a Japanese first language (L1) speaker who lived in the United States with her family for almost two years, until she was six and a half years of age. One year after the family's return to Japan the girl became my student at an English conversation school in Japan. She attended weekly lessons with me for almost three years, during which time this study's data was collected over a period of one and a half years.

,2003.0,Interlanguage Pragmatics Study and Japanese Language Education,"The study of Japanese interlanguage pragmatics is a very young field. A close productive connection between the field & Japanese language education has not yet been fully constructed. One possible reason for this is that due to the lack of a comprehensive survey, it has been difficult to get an accurate overview of the findings & problems in the field. In this paper, I will first give an overview of the development of interlanguage pragmatics study abroad. Then, in comparison, I will look at the currents of interlanguage pragmatics study on L2 Japanese in Japan in order to clarify findings & problems in this field. I will then discuss applications of the findings in the study of interlanguage pragmatics to Japanese language education & point out some issues that Japanese language teachers should pay attention to in order to provide their students with appropriate pragmatic inputs. 1 Appendix, 45 References.
