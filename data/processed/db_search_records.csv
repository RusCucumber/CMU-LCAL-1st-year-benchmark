A. Abdallah,2015.0,The Effects of Explicit Instruction on EFL Students’ Production and Perception of Requests,"As an exploratory study to expand the scope of pedagogical intervention to the teaching of pragmatics, the present research sought to examine the effects of explicit instruction on the learning of request forms. The effects were examined in two respects: the learners’ strategies in formulating request forms, and their perceptions of the pragmatic intervention. To this end, 50 third-year English students at the faculty of Arts and Humanities Sfax, Tunisia were exposed to explicit instruction in the form of awareness-raising tasks and written meta pragmatic feedback on the use of appropriate requests. They were required to take a pre-test, receive a one-month treatment, and take a post-test. In line with previous research, the study showed that learners’ production of requests benefited from the explicit instruction and the questionnaire data indicated that the explicit teaching has helped the learners understand the appropriate use of request strategies.",,10.17722/jell.v3i3.113,https://doi.org/10.17722/jell.v3i3.113,forward

A. Barron,2016.0,Developing pragmatic competence using EFL textbooks: Focus on requests,"Learning to request in a foreign language is a key competence within communicative language teaching. This paper examines how requests are taught using English G2000A (Cornelsen), an EFL textbook series employed in many schools in Germany. The focus of analysis is on the linguistic request strategies and request modification (pragmalinguistics) to be learned and on the contextual information provided on the use of these linguistic forms (sociopragmatics). Findings reveal that commonly employed request strategies and cognitively simple forms of modification are introduced – also in line with developmental patterns. However, it is also found that many strategies are not dealt with and that modification is only touched on. On a sociopragmatic level, a strong focus is found to exist on standard situations in which role relations are clear. Contextual constraints are generally communicated implicitly only and there is a general danger of overgeneralization. Finally, the textbook only considers cross-cultural differences in requesting to a very narrow extent. The paper closes with some recommendations.",,10.20533/licej.2040.2589.2016.0288,https://doi.org/10.20533/licej.2040.2589.2016.0288,forward

"A. Bataineh, Nadhim Obaid Hussein",2015.0,The Effect of Using Web-Cam Chat on the Undergraduate EFL Students’ Pragmatic Competence,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of using web-cam chat on developing of the pragmatic aspects of language by college-level English as foreign language (EFL) learners in Jordan. A quantitative approach was applied to determine first, whether the use of web-cam chats had a positive effect on EFL learners’ pragmatic competence. Second, the effect of presenting pragmatic through two delivery systems face-to-face, in-class activities and computer-mediated communication (CMC) via web-cam chats i.e. Facebook and Skype was investigated in this study. The sample of the study consisted of thirty-two undergraduate students who made up two intact classes in a ""Conversation Skills course, which call Penguin Functional English by Peter Watcyn-J0nes .Code N 1302109” at AL al-Bayt University in Jordan, during the second semester of the academic year 2013/2014. The students were interviewed in order to know their actual levels in the pragmatic aspects of English before starting the experiment. The sample  was divided into two groups; the control group (15 students) was taught the course content using the regular communicative method through which students received instructor-led lessons from the textbook, while group two, the experimental (17 students) was taught using web-cam chat. After conducting the activities, a post test was administered. Scores were tabulated and prepared for statistical analysis. The results showed that web-cam chat had a positive impact on the EFL learners’ pragmatic competence. Learners who studied via web-cam chat performed better on the pragmatic aspects of English post-test than those who did not. The findings also indicated that technology can be a valuable tool for delivering pragmatic instruction. Moreover, the findings of the study revealed that students acquired the speaking and listening skills in web-cam chat more efficiently and effectively than in the regular communicative method.",,10.5296/IJE.V7I2.7929,https://doi.org/10.5296/IJE.V7I2.7929,forward

Analysis of 64 separate studies representing 88 unique samples reporting sufficient data indicated that DDL approaches result in large overall effects for both control/experimental group comparisons (d = 0.95) and for pre/posttest designs (d = 1.50). Further investigation of moderator variables revealed that small effect sizes were generally tied to small sample sizes. Research has barely begun in some key areas, and durability/transfer of learning through delayed posttesting remains an area in need of further investigation. Although DDL research demonstrably improved over the period investigated, further changes in practice and reporting are recommended.",,10.1111/LANG.12224,https://doi.org/10.1111/LANG.12224,forward

A. Cohen,2016.0,The teaching of pragmatics by native and nonnative language teachers: What they know and what they report doing,"The paper focuses on how nonnative teachers of a target language (NNTs) deal with pragmatics in their classes. It starts with a discussion of what pragmatics entails. Next, issues relating to the teaching of pragmatics are identified, such as the language background of the teacher, comparisons between second- (L2) and foreign-language (FL) instruction, and the potential role of digital media and other means in providing models for pragmatic behavior. Then, an international survey is presented which probed into the experiences of NNTs of various languages while teaching the pragmatics of their language of instruction. A total of 113 teachers were asked to indicate what they taught with regard to pragmatics, 30 native-language teachers (NTs) and 83 NNTs. They were also asked to report on their experience as teachers of L2 and FL pragmatics (e.g., if they encountered classroom moments when they did not feel like an authority on some aspect of pragmatics, what they did about it). Since pragmatics is a meeting of language and culture, the teacher respondents were asked to assess their knowledge regarding pragmalinguistics (i.e., the language forms) and sociopragmatics (sociocultural knowledge). In addition, they were asked to give their opinion regarding similarities and differences between the teaching of FL as opposed to L2 pragmatics, as this traditional dichotomy gives way to a more hybrid reality in an increasingly globalized world. Similarly, they were asked about their methods for teaching pragmatics (e.g., their use of digital media and their handling of dialect differences). Finally, they were asked to suggest areas in which they would like to see research conducted that would inform the teaching of pragmatics. The paper reports the findings from the study, including statistical differences in reported teaching of criticism, sarcasm, and cursing, as well as in the use of digital media and in having students gather data on pragmatics.",,10.14746/SSLLT.2016.6.4.2,https://doi.org/10.14746/SSLLT.2016.6.4.2,forward

In some cases the research effort would entail following up on studies initiated some years ago and in other cases the effort would involve relatively new research thrusts. The paper includes ideas about research regarding: (1) pathways to success in language learning – language learners as informed consumers, the role of motivation in the L2-FL interface, the language of thought for learning the target language, the impact of L2/FL error correction over time, the use and impact of websites accessed in support of language learning, and language attrition over time; (2) language learner strategies – the fluctuating functions of strategies, refining strategies for language learning, the language strategies of hyperpolyglots, and test-taking strategies; and (3) pushing the envelope with regard to TL pragmatics – the less researched speech acts, the effects of explicit instruction in pragmatics, the learning of pragmatics in the TL classroom from native- and non-native teachers, and the teaching of pragmatics in World Englishes.",,10.5070/L210136653,https://doi.org/10.5070/L210136653,forward

Sixty-two second-year university students were assigned to either a control group receiving textbook input or an experimental group receiving authentic input, and their pretreatment and posttreatment levels of overall communicative competence were assessed. Communicative competence was operationalized with a batch of eight different tests: a listening test, a pronunciation test, a C-test, a grammar test, a vocabulary test, a discourse completion task, an oral interview, and a student-student role-play. The results indicated that the experimental group outperformed the control group in five of the eight measures, suggesting that the authentic materials and their associated tasks were more effective in developing a broader range of communicative competencies in learners than the textbook materials.

The sample involved 96 B.A. and M.A. Iranian EFL learners and 10 native speakers of English. A Discourse Completion Test (DCT) was used to generate data related to the request strategies used by each group. The selection of request situations in the DCT was based on 2 social factors of relative power and social distance. Although the results revealed pragmatic development, particularly in the movement from direct to conventionally indirect strategies on the part of the EFL learners, the EFL learners with higher proficiency displayed overuse of indirect type of requesting, whereas the native group was characterized by the more balanced use of this strategy. The lower proficiency EFL learners, on the other hand, overused the most direct strategy type. In terms of the influence of the social variables, the findings of this research revealed that as far as social power is concerned, the EFL learners displayed closer performance to the native speakers. But considering social distance, it seems that the Iranian EFL learners had not acquired sufficient sociopragmatic knowledge to display proper social behavior.",,10.4304/JLTR.2.4.790-803,https://doi.org/10.4304/JLTR.2.4.790-803,forward
"A. Kargar, A.

The main objective of the study was to determine whether collaborative translation tasks, either from or to the target language, presented in a supportive expert-novice environment, might lead to more efficient learning and retention of pragmatic knowledge. For this purpose, an experimental study was designed with four experimental groups and one control group, receiving different types of treatment including CTTs, and structured input with and without explicit instruction. Three equivalent forms of discourse completion tasks (DCT) were given to 150 low-intermediate participants as a pre-test, a post-test and a two-month follow-up delayed post-test. The results of the study indicated that CTTs appeared to have enabled noticing and deeper processing of both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic knowledge and resulted in improved learning and retention of pragmatic knowledge. The results also provide positive evidence for House's (2008) hypothesis that translation has the potential to raise pragmatic and cross-cultural awareness.",,10.1080/09571736.2021.1957989,https://doi.org/10.1080/09571736.2021.1957989,forward

Cross-sectional data collection was undertaken to analyze the relationship between the variables and the speech acts recognized and rated by learners at different proficiency levels. A three way between subject analyses (ANOVA) showed quantitative differences among the three groups according to individual differences. Further, in-depth analyses of test items indicated that EFL learners’ at the three proficiency levels identified and rated grammatical errors as more serious than pragmatic errors.  Results revealed qualitative, developmental information about the cognitive and individual traits followed in pragmatic awareness. One significant implication is that any account of the development of ILP should take into consideration the individual differences that will intervene between the stages of noticing and target like production.  Moreover, being linguistically competent is not only essential for the EFL learner but acquiring pragmatic competence is also important.",,10.22054/ILT.2015.3190,https://doi.org/10.22054/ILT.2015.3190,forward

Additionally, the investigation also focused on the effect of these cognitive styles on individual differences (IDs) like proficiency, age, and gender of the participants. To this end, 80 EFL learners, studying at two English language institutes in Maybod, were selected through convenient sampling. This study was conducted in three phases by using a variety of instruments, like Oxford Quick Placement Test (OPT), Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT), and Multiple Choice Discourse Completion Tasks (MCDCTs). With respect to the GEFT, students were divided into two groups, FD/FI. The MCDCTs were administered to measure students’ pragmatic comprehension and restructuring ability of the apology situations. The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS 21 statistical software. The results revealed that FI participants outperformed the FD ones in apology contexts. Individual differences like gender and age had a significant effect on the performance of the participants in both cognitive groups. Although the proficiency level demonstrated some variations, but it did not have any statistically significant impact on the performance of the participants in these two groups. The major pedagogical implication of the present study is that when assessing the interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) of EFL learners, teachers and other teaching administrations should take not only cognitive styles but also individual differences into consideration so that they could adopt and apply teaching methods in line with the learners’ various cognitive styles.",,10.29252/IJREE.5.1.85,https://doi.org/10.29252/IJREE.5.1.85,forward
"A. Mirzaei, A. Roohani, Maryam Esmaeili",2012.0,Exploring Pragmalinguistic and Sociopragmatic Variability in Speech Act Production of L2 Learners and Native Speakers,"The pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic aspects of language use vary across different situations, languages, and cultures. The separation of these two facets of language use can help to map out the socio-cultural norms and conventions as well as the linguistic forms and strategies that underlie the pragmatic performance of different language speakers in a variety of target language use situations. This study explored the sociopragmatic and pragmalinguistic variations in the expression and realization of three speech acts of apology, request, and refusal by American native speakers and Iranian EFL learners. The participants were 100 graduate and undergraduate Iranian students and 50 American native speakers. A written discourse completion test (WDCT) was developed through a bottom-up procedure and used for collecting the data. The results showed that considerable variations emerged in the semantic formulae, sociopragmatic content, and pragmalinguistic forms the participants employed in realizing the speech acts in relation to the contextual variables and individual differences. The American participants employed more (pragmalinguistic) formulaic strategies and were generally more direct than the Iranian L2 learners. Further variability was also noticeable in the participants’ choice of sociopragmatic appropriacy formulae in order to mitigate their speech acts and avoid offending their interlocutors. The findings indicated that there is an intricate reciprocity between the sociopragmatic values and the variant forms or strategies that language users employ on the pragmalinguistic level of language use. It is then suggested that pragmatic variation be traced and probed on the two pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic planes of language use in real-life (or simulated) contexts.",,10.22099/JTLS.2012.622,https://doi.org/10.22099/JTLS.2012.622,forward

Given this premise, the current study aimed to examine effects of classroom praxis-based instruction adjusted to EFL learners’ Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) on their comprehension of CIMs. Participants were 36 Iranian high school students in 2 classrooms, assigned to experimental and comparison groups. A 20-item CIM test was administered at pretest and posttest times to collect the data. Microgenetic trajectories were also traced through audio-recorded role-plays and social interactions within the ZPD setting. ZPD-adjusted mediational instruction on CIMs was given based on a multi-level regulatory scale and a view of microgenetic development along an other-to self-regulated functioning continuum. In the non-ZPD setting, mainstream teacher-fronted instruction was employed. ANCOVA results revealed differential instructional effects in favor of the praxis-based mediational setting. Microgenetic learning episodes also portrayed how collectively-mediated, ZPD-activated learning led to L2 learners’ progressively improved comprehension of CIMs. The findings suggest that comprehension (and perhaps production) of L2 CIMs can be improved through praxis-oriented co-construction of pragmatic knowledge through collaborative engagement with communicative activity.",,10.1515/lpp-2021-0007,https://doi.org/10.1515/lpp-2021-0007,forward

The current study was designed to explore the effects of synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) and asynchronous computer-mediated communication (ACMC) course modules delivered through social media networks (SMN) on the development of the Iranian L2 learners‘ comprehension of implicatures. The participants of the study were 90 English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) undergraduate students attending three intact classes. The classes were randomly assigned to one control and two experimental (SCMC and ACMC) groups. An open-ended implicature comprehension test was used to assess students‘ ILP development in this pretest-posttest comparison-group study. The control group received the traditional teacher-fronted instruction, and the S/ACMC groups received instruction via synchronous and asynchronous modules of SMNs for 4 months, respectively. Students‘ attitudes towards the CMC-based courses were also sought. Split-plot ANOVA results indicated that both experimental groups developed significant ILP ability to comprehend and interpret L2 implicatures after the instruction; however, by comparison, the ACMC group improved more considerably. It is concluded that, first, comprehending L2 implicatures is not impervious to computer-mediated instruction and, second, different CMC affordances may result in differential ILP developmental effects in teaching L2 pragmatics. The findings can help L2 teachers decide how to use CMC affordances and SMN modules to raise L2 learners‘ pragmatic awareness.",,10.18869/ACADPUB.IJAL.19.1.141,https://doi.org/10.18869/ACADPUB.IJAL.19.1.141,forward

"A. R. Altakhaineh, Marwa Abu Hasheish, Dana Hamaydeh",2024.0,Pragmatic Failures in Intercultural Communication: Evidence from Jordan,"Aim. This paper investigates the pragmatic errors of Jordanian EFL learners from a cultural perspective on communication. It is suggested that pragmatics, or the study of how language is used in context, plays a crucial role in L2 learners’ communicative skills. Thus, the research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the lack of pragmatic competence can lead to communication breakdowns and pragmatic failure. In this study, the researchers examine the pragmatic errors such as misunderstandings produced by these learners. 
Method. A qualitative approach was employed, the data were collected from conversations between teacher and Jordanian students and informal conversation through a focus group discussion taking place inside classrooms. The data were analyzed qualitatively in light of Austin’s (1962) Speech Act Theory, categorizing the data into direct and indirect speech act, and Brown & Levinson’s (1987) Politeness Theory, by determining the category of politeness -positive, negative, off-record, bald-on record or Not Applicable- for each speech act. 
Results. The results showed that despite having a strong grasp of English grammar rules, without effective communication skills in English, EFL learners may struggle to interact with native speakers and fully participate in social and professional interactions. Learners with greater exposure to cultural materials and interactions with native speakers demonstrated fewer pragmatic errors. A recurrent theme in the data was also the learners’ struggle with indirect speech acts. The main contribution of this paper is that it explores how pragmatic failure hinders message interpretation and obstructs communication.",,10.31470/2309-1797-2024-36-2-38-62,https://doi.org/10.31470/2309-1797-2024-36-2-38-62,forward

A prevalent concern in teaching second language (L2) pragmatics involves pedagogical materials (Bardovi-Harlig, 2017). Although previous research has found discrepancies in pragmatic language seen in L2 textbooks and elicited responses via discourse completion tasks (DCTs) (e.g. Pablos-Ortega, 2011), workplace language textbooks have seldom been investigated. Therefore, the present study used speech act typologies (Alcon, Safont & Martinez-Flor, 2005; Trosborg, 1995) and criteria for conventional expressions (Bardovi-Harlig, 2012) to identify the most frequently-occurring requests in 17 workplace language textbooks. The same process was applied to 30 native English speakers' elicited, audio-recorded oral DCT responses. Significant differences were found in the frequency of request types identified in the textbooks and elicited responses. The results suggest that workplace language textbooks provide insufficient pragmatic input for L2 learners who are preparing for the workplace.",,10.22215/etd/2018-13238,https://doi.org/10.22215/etd/2018-13238,forward
"A. Sachtleben, H.

This involved the use of semiauthentic discourse samples of New Zealand English to raise the pragmatic awareness of trainee interpreters in an undergraduate course taught by the first author. The researchers analysed qualitative data from learner blogs, written during instruction as part of the course requirements, for evidence that the learners noticed paralinguistic features used for pragmatic effect in conversations they overheard or took part in outside the classroom.

The researchers found there was a growth in the number of learners noticing pragmatic features during tuition, suggesting that the semiauthentic samples were effective as learning tools.

"A. Van Dyke, William R. Acton",2021.0,Spontaneous classroom engagement facilitating development of L2 pragmatic competence,"
The question of how to teach toward social, cultural and linguistic L2 pragmatic competence has raised serious challenges (Kasper, 1997). This is more the case for spoken rather than written discourse. As can be expected, the underlying pragmatic implications of spontaneous face-to-face communication naturally constrains the interactional scope and its potential pedagogical application. To address this issue, this naturalistic study explores two key potential contributors to the development of oral pragmatic competence: meta-pragmatic classroom conversational discourse and the course framework supporting that kind of relatively spontaneous interaction. An English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course provided fluency practice protocols, instruction in pragmatic categories, analysis of conversational data and “live” in-class intervention, focusing on meaning and alternate expressions and forms. Those interventions were designed to enhance learners’ ability to self-assess, monitor and expand their interactional repertoires. Part of a larger research project examining principles of pragmatics applied in EAP instruction, this study focuses on data from spontaneous classroom interactions situated within the integrated instructional framework of the course. Results present a range of strategies employed by the instructor consistent with current theoretical models of factors or pedagogical interventions that facilitate development of pragmatic competence.",,10.1075/PL.20011.VAN,https://doi.org/10.1075/PL.20011.VAN,forward
A. Zughaibi,2022.0,The barefoot shoemaker's son: examining EFL teachers' pragmatic competence in a Saudi context,"PurposeEnglish instructors' pragmatic competence (PC) is an aspect of the overall communicative competence forming the basis of language instructors' knowledge. Their knowledge of pragmatics should not be overlooked when seeking to understand foreign language learners' communicative ability. This study aims to investigate the pragmatic awareness and teaching practices of non-native EFL instructors with different qualifications and from various cultural backgrounds in Saudi Arabia.Design/methodology/approachTo obtain a broader perspective, this study adopted a quantitative research design. An online questionnaire, developed from Ivanova (2018) and Tulgar (2016), was accessed by 320 instructors at one English teaching institute in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire consisted of demographic information about participants and 12 closed Likert-type questions.FindingsThe data analysis showed that most of the language instructors were aware of PC. However, some variations were evident in their views of the importance of pragmatics in teaching and learning and in their actual pragmatic teaching practices.Originality/valueThis study emphasizes the importance of pragmatic awareness for EFL instructors. It indicates that while non-native English instructors' academic levels and cumulative experience in teaching English play a major role in teaching, instructors have several challenges in teaching pragmatics and promoting students' awareness of pragmatics in this context. For effective second language teaching of pragmatics, instructors, managers and policymakers need to recognize the importance of pragmatics and competencies that students need to develop in EFL contexts.",,10.1108/sjls-02-2022-0013,https://doi.org/10.1108/sjls-02-2022-0013,forward

A lack of appropriate knowledge and pragmatic activities may limit students’ pragmatic growth in the target language. Thus far, most pragmatic research has focused on issues concerning learners’ pragmatic competence, with only a few studies focusing on teachers’ pragmatic competence, particularly in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) contexts. A total of 86 EFL teachers from Saudi public schools participated in this study. The questionnaire created by Ivanova (2018) was used to collect data for this study. The findings indicated that even though some teachers did not respond or provided irrelevant or incorrect examples of speech acts, Saudi EFL teachers have a relatively high level of awareness in general, and teachers’ qualifications and gender have no significant effect on pragmatic awareness, with female teachers having slightly higher pragmatic awareness than male teachers, and master’s degree holders having slightly higher pragmatic awareness than bachelor’s degree holders. This suggests that, while individual characteristics, such as gender and degree, have no apparent effect on awareness, teachers should be aware of their own pragmatic competence to develop their students’ pragmatic competence.",,10.46687/jjtj7006,https://doi.org/10.46687/jjtj7006,forward

Prior to the experiment, 110 Iranian EFL learners were asked to participate in the study to help the researchers develop the instruments, i.e., a recognition and a production test. Also, 43 American native English speakers were employed to provide the baseline data for the development of the recognition test and the instructional materials. To carry out the study, the researchers matched 60 subjects in two groups based on their scores on the Oxford Placement Test (2004) and their inclination to interpersonal or linguistic intelligence. The groups were then randomly assigned to instructional conditions, namely the DIG and CR tasks. These tasks were utilized to implement the instructional treatment in eight sessions. The results revealed no significant differences between the participants in the DIG and CR tasks on the production and recognition measures. Due to the initial differences on the recognition measure, the pretest-posttest mean differences revealed that the DIG task was more effective in the enhancement of learners’ recognition ability. While the effects of MIwere not significant on pragmatic measures, a significant interaction in favor of learners with an inclination to interpersonal and linguistic intelligences was respectively observed for the participants in the DIG and CR tasks.",,10.22132/TEL.2014.53819,https://doi.org/10.22132/TEL.2014.53819,forward

Accordingly, the present investigation has attempted to examine the relationship between L2 learners’ multiple intelligences and their speech-act pragmatic performance. A sample of 124 EFL students who were selected from an initial sample of 206 learners at two Iranian state universities based on their scores on the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency (MTELP) took part in this study. The data collection procedure was done in two subsequent phases. First, McKenzie's (1999) multiple intelligences (MI) survey including 90 items was filled out by the participants. Then, a validated 50-item multiple-choice discourse completion test (MDCT) including five frequent English speech acts (requests, apologies, refusals, complaints, and compliments/compliment responses) was administered. Data analysis using multiple regression revealed that four of the intelligence including logical, interpersonal, verbal, and intrapersonal intelligences were significant predictors of L2 learners' speech-act pragmatic knowledge. Among these four intelligences, verbal intelligence was the strongest followed by interpersonal, intrapersonal, and logical intelligences. However, five other intelligences (i.e., naturalistic, musical, existential, visual, & kinesthetic intelligences were not significant predictors of L2 pragmatic performance). These findings can have some pedagogical implications for EFL teachers in helping their learners develop their speech-act pragmatic knowledge based on their MIs.",,10.22132/TEL.2020.107876,https://doi.org/10.22132/TEL.2020.107876,forward
"Abdullah Sarani, Amrollah Talati-Baghsiahi",2017.0,Explicit Instruction of Pragmatic Features: Its Impact on EFL Learners’ Knowledge of Hedging Devices in Academic Writing,"Hedging academic claims has been recognized as one of integral pragmatic features of academic writing in which most EFL academic writers seem to face substantial problems. Explicit instruction has been proposed by some scholars as an effective approach to make EFL writers aware of the importance, different forms, and pragmatic functions of hedging devices some of which are polysemous and polypragmatics (e.g., Hyland 1996a). The present study with the aim of shedding more light on the effectiveness of explicit instruction in improving the pragmatic knowledge of Iranian EFL learners in terms of hedging devices, investigates the acquisition and use of English modal auxiliaries as hedging strategies via applying a direct teaching strategy in the classroom. To this end a sample of 37 undergraduate students majoring in different fields of study were recruited and assigned into a control and experimental group. Explicit instruction of the modal auxiliaries as hedging resources was applied for the treatment group while the control group received only the regular academic writing instruction. A pretest and a posttest were administered to the two groups. The descriptive analysis of the scores as well as the results of the t-tests revealed a significant progress in the participants’ linguistic and pragmatic knowledge of modal auxiliaries as hedges in the treatment group. The results also indicated that the experimental group outperformed the control group in acquiring and using modal verbs to hedge their claims.

These sequences have been examined by many researchers to find the situation-based formulas which may help L2 learners follow a possibly more target-like speaking system. This study, therefore, explored two categories of formulaic expressions including speech formulas and situation-bound utterances used by EFL learners. The randomly selective participants included 30 intermediate and 30 advanced learners, who performed a total number of 120 role-play tasks focused on the situations which required the use of thanking, requesting, offering, and apology speech acts. Audio-recorded data from role-plays were transcribed and analyzed based on existing lists of speech formulas. Results showed that the participants produced more than 102 types of formulaic sequences that could be called “a list of pragmatic routines for thanking, requesting, offering, and apologizing speech acts in the EFL context”.  This list includes 44 and 58 speech formulas and situation-bound utterances, respectively. Results further indicated that advanced language learners used more diverse situation-bound utterances in terms of its internal and contextual complexity than their counterparts in the intermediate group due to expert judgments. Because these formulas can increase coherence in speaking, and enhance effective and natural communication, their instruction could be part of the language teaching curriculum.",,10.22099/JTLS.2019.33711.2694,https://doi.org/10.22099/JTLS.2019.33711.2694,forward
Abigail McMeekin,2022.0,"Teaching Pragmatics and Instructed Second Language Learning: Study Abroad and Technology-Enhanced Teaching, written by Halenko, Nicola","Pragmatics is teachable and is as fundamental for communication as knowing the grammatical aspects of an L2. These principles are now widely known, but there is still a large gap to be filled in this regard, especially when it comes to foreign language teaching materials. As a way of bringing contributions to the improvement of this scenario, the study under review aimed to investigate whether there are differences, in terms of effectiveness, between explicit instruction on British English pragmatic aspects – with particular emphasis on an interactive tool named oral computeranimated production task (CAPT) as opposed to paper-based tasks – and learning purely based on the contact with the target language/culture. The research participants were mainly Chinese adults, international students at a university in the UK, and the investigated speech acts were requests and apologies, carried out within a conversational genre named institutional talk. Comprising ten chapters, the volume begins with an overall approach to the numerous themes which pervade the study. In chapter 2, the author outlines an overview of studies in L2 and SLA pragmatics, discussing both concepts and seminal works from the 1980s and 1990s, in which the idea of communicative competence had great relevance, and more recent studies, in which the notions of interactional and intercultural competence are increasingly present.

The present inquiry contributes to filling the gap in the literature, and it does so by examining such responses in two languages, Australian English (AE) and Bahasa Indonesia (BI).

It probes behavioural differences in the genders in and between the two societies, and considers cultural differences in the expression of ARs. Using oral discourse completion tasks (DCTs), the researchers recorded and analyzed a total of 360 responses to three apology situations. The findings reveal that ARs in both languages were complex and elaborate, embodying various subsidiary speech acts and expressions. The ARs generally showed indirectness and mitigated face threats towards interlocutors. However, one striking result is that there was no marked gender difference in AR strategy either within or between languages, thus challenging a stereotype that females are more accepting and 'polite' than males (Brown, 1980; Holmes, 1995, 2008). Another surprising result was that, in a significant minority of cases, Indonesians were revealed to be more direct and face-threatening than their Australian counterparts, again confronting a stereotype of speech behaviour, in this case that Asians are more indirect and ambiguous than native English-speakers in Western cultures.",,10.1075/ARAL.36.1.04JON,https://doi.org/10.1075/ARAL.36.1.04JON,forward

Afef Labben,2016.0,Reconsidering the development of the discourse completion test in interlanguage pragmatics,"A survey of the field of Interlanguage Pragmatics (ILP) shows that the Discourse Completion Test (DCT)2, also referred to as a ‘discourse completion task’ or a ‘production questionnaire’, has been the most frequently used instrument to evaluate second/foreign language learners’ ability to perform speech acts in a target language, despite the harsh criticism leveled against its low construct validity and its failure to represent the features of authentic discourse. Interestingly, focusing on the statement of objectives of a number of ILP studies using DCTs, one can notice that such studies rarely refer to the DCT as a language test. In addition, an overview of the DCT design process as described in several ILP studies shows that ever since its adaptation for the study of pragmatic ability (Blum-Kulka, 1982), there has been a tendency to use or adapt one of the existing DCT versions used in previous studies based on the argument of comparability of results. While a number of ILP researchers tried to improve the design of the DCT by the inclusion of rejoinders or by enhancing the prompt material (e.g. Billmyer and Varghese, 2000), few attempts have been made to reconsider the DCT development process. McNamara and Roever (2006: 253) urge for the need for “more research on testing of sociopragmatic knowledge and design of discourse completion tests for testing purposes.”The present paper starts with an overview of the literature about DCTs with special reference to the cognitive validity of the instrument and to previous studies dealing with DCT structure and content. Then, with reference to research in the fields of language testing and psychometrics, it shows that, whether used for research or instructional purposes, the DCT shares several qualities with language tests. As such, it is argued that the DCT should be treated as a language test and not as a questionnaire and should, thus, undergo a rigorous developmental process.

Such an ability is influenced by the contextual and social variables that determine the linguistic resources required for choosing particular types of speech acts. Framed in speech act and sociopragmatic theories, this study sought to investigate the effect of using short stories vs. Video clips on the improvement of foreign language students’ oral production of English speech acts. To this end, from the target sample of students learning English at Isfahan University Language Center, those at the upper intermediate level were selected using a Quick Oxford Placement Test (QOPT). At the next step, the samples were randomly divided into three groups, twenty-five each and then they were assigned to one control and two experimental groups. The treatment included direct instruction of most commonly used speech acts across different cultures including disagreement, request, refusal, apology, and thanking through the application of carefully chosen short stories and video clips. While one of the experimental groups received their instruction through short stories, the other was exposed to video clips. Before and after the treatment, Two Discourse Completion Tests (DCT) were used as pre and posttests whereby the participants were encouraged to produce the targeted speech acts in specific but contrived real life contexts. The quantitative analyses of the data revealed that the students in the treatment groups significantly outperformed those of the control group in producing the target speech acts orally. Moreover, the students exposed to video mediated instruction displayed better oral production of speech acts than those receiving their instruction through short stories.

Within the context of Greek EFL education, where English is introduced at a young age, proficient Greek speakers of English often grapple with cross-cultural misunderstandings during communication. This study presents an extensive examination of the curriculum used in the initial year of Greek high school education (lyceums), with a specific focus on im-plicature. The central objective is to assess the adequacy of the instructional materials in cultivating learners’ pragmatic awareness, particularly their competence in identifying implicatures within written contexts. Notably, the analysis reveals a prevalence of non-creative implicatures, suggesting that contextual cues played a marginal role in their comprehension. Implicatures prominently featured in literary and lyrical forms, underscoring the propensity of poetic language for non-literal expression, while news articles demonstrated a predilection for literal language usage due to their objective nature. Furthermore, a limited utilization of relevant implicatures in instructional exercises is observed, with only a fraction of tasks capitalizing on this vital pragmatic facet. Specifically, among a total of 97 tasks, merely 8 exhibited partial incorporation of implicatures, representing less than 10% of the total exercise pool. The implications of these findings underscore the imperative of enhancing pragmatics instruction to better equip learners for effective cross-cultural communication.",,10.4236/ojml.2023.135038,https://doi.org/10.4236/ojml.2023.135038,forward

"Ahmed Alduais, Issa Al-Qaderi, Hind Alfadda",2022.0,Pragmatic Language Development: Analysis of Mapping Knowledge Domains on How Infants and Children Become Pragmatically Competent,"New-borns are capable of recognising and producing sounds as they become phonologically competent. Following this, infants develop a system for connecting these sounds, which helps them become increasingly lexically competent over time. Their knowledge of these words grows as they develop, using words to form phrases, turning them into sentences, and ultimately becoming syntactically competent. By making sense of these linguistic elements, these three competencies are enhanced, and this is how infants become semantically competent. As infants continue to develop linguistic and non-linguistic communication behaviours, this miraculous language development becomes even more complex, enabling them to perfect their linguistic abilities while being pragmatically competent. In this study, a scientometric approach was used to examine past, present, and future trends in pragmatic language development (PLD). A total of 6455 documents were analysed from the Scopus, WOS, and Lens databases between 1950 and 2022.

The themes and topics included (1) analysing PLD as a social behaviour through the lens of executive functions; (2) studying PLD as a social behaviour based on social understanding; (3) examining PLD as a social behaviour associated with autism spectrum disorder; (4) developing an understanding of PLD in academic settings through the examination of executive functions; (5) identifying pragmatic competence versus communicative competence as a social behaviour; (6) analysing pragmatic language skills in aphasic patients via epistemic stances (i.e., attitudes towards knowledge in interaction); (7) investigating PLD as a behavioural problem in the context of a foreign language; (8) assessing PLD as a behavioural problem in individuals with autism spectrum disorder; (9) assessing PLD in persons with traumatic brain injury and closed head injury as a behavioural problem; (10) identifying the role of the right hemisphere in executive functions as a cognitive substrate; (11) assessing the impact of pragmatic failure in speech acts on pragmatic competence; and (12) investigating the patterns of PLD among learning-disabled children.",,10.3390/children9091407,https://doi.org/10.3390/children9091407,forward
"Ahmed Alduais, Issa Al-Qaderi, Najla Alfadda, Hind Alfadda",2022.0,Pragmatics: Mapping Evidence on Enhancing Children’s Use of Linguistic and Non-Linguistic Capacities for Interactive Communication,"New-born infants communicate from the first minute they come to life. This non-linguistic and non-verbal capacity to interact from the first day they come to life enables them to express their needs and evidence their typical development. This capacity to interact develops to include linguistic and non-linguistic use of verbal and non-verbal interaction, that is, pragmatics. Because pragmatics is heterogeneously structured of semiotic, cognitive, motor and sensory elements so it is vital to ensure successful human interaction. The other language elements (i.e., phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic) are essential inputs for this human interaction outcome (i.e., pragmatics). Accordingly, this study sought to map evidence that pragmatics can enhance children’s use of linguistic and non-linguistic capacities for interactive communication. This was addressed by conducting bibliometric and scientometric analyses of 6554 documents from Scopus, 1167 from WOS and 11,230 from Lens between 1939 and 2022. We analysed the past, present and future developments of the field of pragmatics using bibliometric and scientometric indicators. The scientometric analysis was conducted using CiteSpace 5.8.R3 and VOSviewer 1.6.18 software, which enabled the tabulation, visualisation and measurement of the impact of central influencers in the field of pragmatics. In the light of our results, pragmatics continues to expand in order to understand human interaction in a deeper way and to enhance children’s typical interactions with the environment around them. The group should also include adults or elderly people whose pragmatic language skills have been impaired due to any acquired or developmental disorder, such as a brain injury.",,10.3390/children9091318,https://doi.org/10.3390/children9091318,forward

The study of pragmatics is interesting as it studies how people make sense of each other linguistically, in the same time, it can be a disappointed area of study because it needs us to make sense of people and what they have in mind.  According to Bardovi-Harlig (1991), the real responsibility of the classroom teacher is making students more aware about existing pragmatic functions in language, especially in discourse. The teachers should know about these speech acts and their elements to use the natural input for the students in a particular content, for a particular purpose, and as part of a strategy. Accordingly, the current review article aims at revealing the following; first, is pragmatics important in teaching and learning a second and foreign languages, based on this, is it a part of teaching English?

"Ai, Haiyang",2017.0,Providing graduated corrective feedback in an intelligent computer-assisted language learning environment,"Corrective feedback (CF), a response to linguistic errors made by second language (L2) learners, has received extensive scholarly attention in second language acquisition. While much of the previous research in the field has focused on whether CF facilitates or impedes L2 development, few studies have examined the efficacy of gradually modifying the explicitness or specificity of CF as a function of a learner's response to the feedback. Yet, the type and extent of CF needed by a learner, as suggested by Vygotsky (1978), sheds light on whether a learner is developing his or her abilities in a particular area and the ways in which they do it. This paper reports on a study that explores the design, effectiveness and learners' perception toward a graduated (Aljaafreh &amp; Lantolf, 1994) approach to CF, i.e., feedback that progresses from very general and implicit to very specific and explicit, in an intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL) environment. The results show that the graduated approach to CF is effective in helping learners to self-identify and self-correct a number of grammatical issues, although an onsite tutor provides necessary remedies when the ICALL system occasionally fails to do its part. Implications for CF research, particularly on the notion of individualized feedback, are also discussed.", Journal Article,10.1017/S095834401700012X,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/providing-graduated-corrective-feedback/docview/1925766153/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Aisha Siddiqa, Shona Whyte",2021.0,Classroom learning of English L2 requests: Input and interactional opportunities in French secondary schools,"With today’s strong focus on communicative competence in second language (L2) classrooms, speech acts like suggestions, requests, refusals, and apologies are often investigated in interlanguage pragmatic (ILP) as well as instructional pragmatics. Even though there is strong evidence in ILP research that purports that L2 learners respond well to pragmatic instruction (Taguchi, 2015), the teaching of L2 pragmatics is not always prioritized in textbooks, teaching programmes or teacher education (Barron, 2016; Savvidou & Economidou-Kogetsidis, 2019) with the consequence that pragmatic learning can only occur incidentally. The present study examines opportunities to acquire L2 requests for 308 English as a foreign language (EFL) learners across 7 years of instruction in French secondary schools, investigating textbooks preferred by teachers, classroom interaction (39 hours), and teacher perspectives (semi-structured interviews with 10 teachers). After a pragmatic analysis of 15 EFL textbooks with a focus on requests, the study examines the incidence of metapragmatic input in 39 hours of teaching in 13 classes at 3 levels, and relates interactional patterns with interview data from the 10 teachers concerned. Findings suggest limited pragmatic input in both textbooks and classroom interaction. By comparing the profiles of teachers who encouraged L2 requests with those who did not, the study offers new explanations for L2 learners’ limited pragmatic development which also broadly corroborate previous findings of somewhat limited potential for L2 pragmatic development in obligatory school contexts.",,10.1177/13621688211064932,https://doi.org/10.1177/13621688211064932,forward

Determining what kind of intervention is most effectual for facilitating learners’ pragmatic development has been a central issue for researchers. To respond to the inconclusive findings in intervention studies and to extend the instructional studies in L2 pragmatics to less studied and more complex teaching targets, such as implicatures, the current study inquired into the effects of metapragmatic awareness, interactive translation, and discussion through video  vignettes on the comprehension of implicatures of 51 (15 male and 36 female) Iranian upper-intermediate EFL learners, who were selected based on Oxford Quick Placement Test (2004) from students majoring English Literature and TEFL at Golestan University, Gorgan, Iran. Fifty-six video prompts containing implicatures from Friends sitcom series and Desperate Housewives TV series were taught to the participants who were randomly assigned to four groups (metapragmatic awareness, interactive translation, discussion, and control). The participants attended the classes twice a week for eight sessions. Results of multiple-choice implicature listening test revealed that all three intervention groups outperformed the control group. Results of Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test illustrated that the metapragmatic awareness group outperformed the interactive translation and discussion groups. No meaningful difference was found between the interactive translation group and the discussion group.

A multiple-choice discourse completion test ‎‎(MDCT) (Liu, 2004) and Bar-Onʼs ‎(1997) EQ scale were used and correlation analysis was done to search for any linkage between ILP and EQ. The Pearson product-moment correlation outcomes ‎revealed no significant relationship between EQ and ILP. However, a significant relation was found between Independence as a component of EQ and ‎EFL learners’ ILP competence. The independent samples t-test outcomes indicated ‎that female participants had a higher level of (ILP) competence than male participants; however, male and female participants did not differ significantly regarding their EQ level. The findings indicate that ‎EQ, in general, is not influential in EFL learners’ ILP competence.

Therefore, this study sought to investigate the effects of interactionist and interventionist models of DA on the accuracy and speed of pragmatic comprehension among a convenience sample of 60 advanced EFL learners who were randomly assigned into two DA groups and a control group. A listening pragmatic comprehension test developed and validated by Garcia (2004) was used both as a pretest and as a posttest. During the 14-session treatment, the interactionist DA group received metapragmatic instruction about 28 conversations, and learners interacted with each other and the teacher. Assistance and scaffolding were continuously provided by the teacher as the more knowledgeable other (MKO) within the learners’ Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). The interventionist DA class received its treatment based on DA procedures as presented by Lantolf and Poehner (2010). However, the Non-DA group only received metapragmatic instruction about the conversations from the instructor without any DA-based intervention or interaction. Data analysis using one-way ANCOVA revealed that study groups differed in their pragmatic comprehension accuracy and speed: DA groups significantly outperformed the control group. The interventionist DA group did significantly better than the interactionist DA group for pragmatic accuracy but nor for pragmatic comprehension speed. The pedagogical implication of the study is that teachers can utilize interventionist and interactionist DA to foster learners’ pragmatic comprehension accuracy.",,10.22054/ILT.2020.53398.515,https://doi.org/10.22054/ILT.2020.53398.515,forward

Second, lexico-pragmatic strategies which were more frequent than grammatical strategies in the second category. Third, the cognitive strategies that comprised both top-down and bottom-up processing strategies in L2 pragmatic comprehension.

To do so, a web-based software, called a Computerized Dynamic Assessment of Speech Acts, Routines, and Implicatures (CDASRI), accessible at http://da-pragmatics.com, was developed. Then, 137 upper-intermediate or advanced high school and university students ranging in age from 16 to 36 from two provinces of Khorasan Razavi and Golestan, Iran, were selected based on convenience sampling, who voluntarily took part in the study. Based on how many hints or mediations were used by each test-taker, the CDASRI provided three scores: actual score (traditional score), mediated score, and learning potential score (LPS). The results of the study indicated that the test could improve test takers’ pragmatic comprehension competence. Moreover, the significant difference between the mediated (using hints) and actual (without hints) scores of learners accounted for the fact that because of test-takers’ different Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) levels, their level of responsiveness to mediation was significantly different from one another. Hence, it can be concluded that traditional non-dynamic test loses sight of a big part of learners’ abilities through neglecting learners’ potentialities and putting emphasis only on their preliminary performance.

Alicia Martínez-Flor,2013.0,Learners' Production of Refusals: Interactive Written DCT versus Oral Role-Play,"Scholars in the field of interlanguage pragmatics (ELP) have examined second language learners' development of pragmatics by means of employing different data collection instruments (Beebe and Cummings, 1996; Duan, 2008; Houck and Gass, 1996; Martinez-Flor, 2006; Sasaki, 1998; Yuan, 2001). Findings from this research have showed the existence of task effects, since learners' performance varied depending on the task they were involved in. Specifically, given the interactive nature of role-plays and authentic discourse, learners' responses in the oral tasks were longer and more elaborate than those elicited in the written form. Therefore, ILP researchers have claimed the need to further investigate this area by widening the types of instruments being employed as well as the context in which they are used. Bearing these assumptions in mind, the present study aims at examining the effects of two production instruments (i.e., interactive written discourse completion test (DCT) and oral role-plays) on learners' use of refusals in a foreign language setting. The participants included 20 Spanish university learners who were required to make refusals to requests in written and oral production instruments. In these research methods, all situations i) varied according to the sociopragmatic factors of status and social distance; ii) were set at familiar contexts to the participants; and iii) asked learners to perform refusals in the role of students. Learners' performance when making refusals in the interactive written DCT and oral role-plays was compared. Results from such a comparison will be presented and discussed, and pedagogical implications highlighted.1 IntroductionOver the last decades, the area of interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) has shown an increasing interest in examining how learners' pragmatic competence in a second (L2) or foreign (FL) language is learnt and taught (Alcon and Martinez-Flor, 2005, 2008; Ishihara and Cohen, 2010; Kasper and Rose, 2002; Martinez-Flor et al., 2003; Rose and Kasper, 2001; Tatsuki, 2005). Since pragmatic language use is a very complex phenomenon with a lot of contextual factors influencing its actual performance, it is of paramount importance to carefully design the methods2 that elicit learners' production of a given pragmatic feature. In fact, how to collect appropriate data is a crucial issue in pragmatic research since the use of a particular elicitation instrument may potentially influence research outcomes (Alcon and Martinez-Flor, 2008; Nurani, 2009). That is the reason why continuous improvements concerning research methodologies in the pragmatics realm have been developed (Bardovi-Harlig, 1999; Cohen, 2004; Felix-Brasdefer, 2010; Kasper, 2000; Kasper and Dahl, 1991; Kasper and Roever, 2005), although there is still the need to further investigate this area by widening the types of data collection methods created, as well as including learners from distinct linguistic backgrounds (Trosborg, 2010).Within this framework, the aim of this chapter is to examine the effects on two elicitation instruments (i.e., interactive written DCT and oral role-play) on learners' production of refusals in a FL context. To this end, we will first provide a detailed literature review on data collection methods employed in ILP by differentiating between oral and written production data. Additionally, the studies that have been conducted with the aim of comparing both oral and written production data will also be described. Then, we will present our particular study with an explanation of how the two instruments were elaborated. Finally, concluding remarks of the present study will be mentioned and suggestions for further research will be proposed.2 Literature review on data production collection instruments in ILPKasper and Roever (2005) have examined the main methodological approaches that have been employed to analyze how target language pragmatics is learnt. The authors divide the data collection instruments used in ILP into three groups: i) examining spoken interaction; ii) questionnaires; and iii) self-report data. …",,10.1163/9789401209717_010,https://doi.org/10.1163/9789401209717_010,ancestry

Beltrán-Palanques",2013.0,Teaching refusal strategies in the foreign language classroom: a focus on inductive-deductive treatments,"The present paper attempts to present a pedagogical model for the integration of pragmatic competence in the foreign language classroom by following an inductive-deductive approach. For the sake of the current article, the pragmatic feature that has been chosen is the speech act of refusals. The rationale behind this selection is based on the fact that refusals are seen as a face-threatening act which may confront listeners’ expectations (Eslami 2010: 217). Hence, learners should obtain a particular pragmatic expertise to outperform refusals successfully and that is the reason why the teaching of this speech act should be integrated in foreign language settings.",,10.18172/JES.2616,https://doi.org/10.18172/JES.2616,forward
Alisa Zavialova,2015.0,Explicit Instruction of Formulaic Expressions and Second Language Pragmatic Competence: A Collective Case Study,"Formulaic expressions often carry a strong sense of social contract and perform specific pragmatic purposes (Bardovi-Harlig, 2012) and therefore play a crucial role in developing L2 pragmatic competence. The present study investigated whether and how the explicit instruction of refusal and thanking formulaic expressions can foster acquisition and retention of these expressions and help L2 learners in developing their pragmatic competence and overcoming challenges they face while performing these speech acts. The results imply that explicit instruction of such expressions and semantic formulas can increase learners’ understanding of the complex phenomenon of formulaicity and help their spoken language become more pragmatically appropriate, more grammatically accurate, more fluent, concise and confident. Explicit instruction also helps L2 learners to overcome the challenges they may face while performing refusal and thanking speech acts.",,10.22215/etd/2015-10878,https://doi.org/10.22215/etd/2015-10878,forward

Current approaches to speech act teaching overlook pragmatic formulas, promoting an incomplete view of pragmatics instruction. This paper reports on the results of a classroom-based study in which a formula-enhanced treatment focusing on both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic components of pragmatic ability was tested. Seven students from the Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC) program participated in four lessons involving pre-, post- and delayed post-test measures. During the treatment, the students were exposed to target formulas from four interaction contexts. A qualitative utterance analysis was conducted to determine how pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic abilities of the students evolved after the teaching intervention. Additionally, three expert judges evaluated students’ pragmatic performance. The results indicate that improvements in both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic abilities of the students were associated with the use of target-like formulas in their speech acts.",,10.55593/ej.27105a2,https://doi.org/10.55593/ej.27105a2,forward

"Almazova, Nadezhda;Sheredekina, Oksana",2022.0,Distance Training of Pragmatic Competence of Law Students via Legal Cases in an English for Specific Purposes Course,"The priority of the competence approach aimed at developing professional competency of higher education students reflects the labour market need for graduates with the skills required by their speciality and relevant to the interrelated disciplines. In the case of law students, such skills include awareness of both domestic and foreign legal systems, as well as full communicative competence in the foreign language they are going to use. A key component of foreign language communicative competence is pragmatic competence—that is, knowledge about how a foreign language is used appropriately in a legal context. The research conducted contributes to the issue of pragmatic competence training by means of a practice-oriented method—that is, the case method. The significance of the case method is determined by the twofold goal of developing pragmatic competence via pseudo-real legal situations that provide students with legal knowledge, as well as stimulate them to be effective communicators in the legal sphere. The study took place at SPbPU and involved 120 s-year law students. The experiment conducted was aimed at comparing the case method and traditional methods used for teaching Legal English, particularly the first legal advice strategy—a component of pragmatic competence. A specific feature of the experiment was that it was organized in the form of distance learning. To collect and analyse the data of the study, a qualitative and a quantitative method were applied. The results of the study showed a high efficiency of the case method for fostering pragmatic competence in an ESP course for law students in comparison with traditional methods, which were not very efficient. Besides, the experiment showed that an on-line format may be an adequate methodological means of effectively achieving the goal in a foreign language training for professional needs in a course with a time limit.", Journal Article,10.3390/educsci12110819,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/distance-training-pragmatic-competence-law/docview/2748270715/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

The second is to find out the types of illocutionary acts which are dominantly expressed in Akeelah and The Bee movie. The last is to identify the types of sentences of indirect speech acts to represent the five types of illocutionary acts. To achieve these objectives, a pragmatic analysis was implemented. Therefore, the research used the theory of speech acts proposed by Yule (2014). The data collected through a purposive sampling, a corpus (transcript of the movie), and a movie. In the three conflict storylines process of data analysis was started by watching the movie and reading the whole script. The next is classifying the data based on the types of illocutionary acts proposed by Yule and the last step was interpreting the data based on the contextual meaning of the utterances from the characters. As a result, three points of conclusions are concluded. The first, the classifications of illocutionary acts found were directive, representative, commissive, and expressive. The second, the most dominant types of illocutionary acts were representative and expressive (37%), the middle was directive (27%), and the less was commissive (9%).

However, evidence for morphosyntactic predictive processing has been limited to gender or case marking in a small subset of Indo-European languages. In the current study, we implemented the eye-tracking visual world paradigm to investigate whether L1 ( n = 18) and L2 ( n = 40) Arabic speakers could extract number information from singular-marked verbs to anticipate the next noun. In a between-subject design, L1 and L2 speakers heard the singular verb in the simple past form (Exp 1) and the progressive past form (Exp 2). The effect of L2 proficiency (measured using a C-test and a receptive vocabulary test) on number prediction was also examined. L1 Arabic speakers showed earlier and stronger number prediction effects regardless of verb aspect. In contrast, L2 speakers exhibited delayed (Exp 1) or limited (Exp 2) prediction, suggesting a mediating role for verb aspect. Increased L2 proficiency did not influence anticipatory eye-movements during the verb region, and only emerged as significant during the noun region. These results confirm and extend earlier research on L1 and L2 number predictive processing.", Journal Article,10.3390/languages10020025,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/predictive-processing-number-information-l1-l2/docview/3171061213/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
Amaliah Amaliah,2024.0,A Review Article of the Pragmatics Competence in EFL Learning Context,"Cross-cultural communication requires pragmatics. Pragmatics is ""the ability to use language appropriately in social settings."" Pragmatic competence in another language involves understanding and carrying out communicative activities or speaking and using the language effectively in varied situations. Several relevant literature and library sources were used for this research. According to Kasper et al. ""Library research, like its twin, the academic experiment, involves a kind of organized investigation with prescribed instruments, rules, and tactics."" Three core library research systems are examined: checking reference sources and databases, finding and utilizing information sources, and assessing information sources according to research objectives. This article analyzes data on pragmatic competence in students of Indonesian and other foreign languages. The author used a public digital search engine to examine scientific literature on pragmatic competency studies in Indonesia to correlate disparate data and find appropriate results. Qualitative research may be more comprehensive. This study found that most studies used a descriptive qualitative approach. The exam is detailed. Most studies used a qualitative approach to characterize L2 practical skills by level and test, while one study assessed learners' cross-cultural awareness during encounters. Most studies on educational participation and the impact of cross-cultural awareness on pragmatic knowledge in EFL learning use qualitative methods, although there are three studies that use quantitative methods. Reviews and debates provide suggestions. Recent research on pragmatic competence in EFL learning settings features a descriptive qualitative approach complemented by Creswell's qualitative approach that provides greater detail about the phenomenon, and all three studies use quantitative methodology. Pragmatic competence improves EFL students' social skills. Al Khadhmi found that the pragmatic meaning of situational utterances was more difficult to interpret compared to lexical stimuli. Therefore, it is better to continuously improve certain areas, such as training EFL students' awareness before they understand a foreign language and activating pragmatic competence and pragmatic components in them, as this affects their communication inside and outside the classroom",,10.35931/aq.v18i1.3163,https://doi.org/10.35931/aq.v18i1.3163,forward

Limited research has delved into the analysis of speech acts employed by English teachers for criticism during classroom interactions. This study primarily aims to identify the classifications of speech acts used most frequently by teachers in English for Academic Purpose (EAP) courses for criticism. Additionally, it examines the rationale behind selecting a particular type of speech act for criticism by EAP course instructors and assesses how this classification of speech acts may influence teaching strategies and student performance. The research employed classroom observations and interviews for data collection, utilizing purposive sampling to select five teachers and forty students from the English department's EAP 009 course. Observational guidelines and situational questionnaires served as research instruments. Qualitative thematic analysis and data coding were applied for data analysis. Classroom observations indicated that EAP teachers predominantly used directive criticism, with a comparatively low utilization of commissive criticism, aligning with the principles of communicative language teaching. Conversely, teacher interviews unveiled that, while direct criticism was prevalent, declarative criticism was also employed. This suggests a need for greater consistency in teachers' selection of specific criticisms, minimizing potential impacts on teaching strategies. The study recommends that EAP teachers diversify their criticism approaches based on student needs and contextual factors.",,10.70771/jocw.v8i1.70,https://doi.org/10.70771/jocw.v8i1.70,forward
Amra I. Sultan,2018.0,Measurement of Sociolinguistic Competence of EFL Post Graduate Students,"   Sociolinguistic competence (henceforth SC)refers to the understanding ,or organization of  the principles of  language use that are determined by the features of  the specific language use context ; it enables us to present language functions in ways that are appropriate to that context. The ability to adjust one's speech to fit the situation in which it is said is called sociolinguistic competence, and without this ability, even the most perfectly grammatical utterances can convey a meaning entirely different from that which the speaker intended. Post-graduate students (henceforth PGSs) find it difficult to communicate freely in the target language. The ‘de-emphasized’ status of this competence in educational practice has to do with the fact that it is closely related to the sociocultural  part of acquiring a foreign language  sociolinguistic confusion can make learners seem so inappropriate as to cause misunderstanding . 
     For nonnative speakers, the misunderstandings they are often faced within the cross-cultural realization of communicative acts usually arise from their failure in appropriate use of pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic competence. Without attempting to  identify and discuss the features of  the language use circumstances that determine the principles of  language use. Cross cultural differences , results in misunderstandings between the speech participants, and can cause serious breakdowns in communication. These rules of speaking can be slowly acquired by the language learner as he/she is immersed in the target language culture; however, learning these rules through immersion is a time consuming process, with many rules going unnoticed for years, or even worse, never being acquired at all. important area of difficulty that PGSs face  is communication. 
  
     This study will focus on SC because it seems to be the most neglected aspect among the four categories of communicative competence in foreign language curriculum. When engaged in authentic communicative situations, they often lack some of the vocabulary or language items they need to get their meaning across. The study also aims at measuring SC of EFL Post Graduate Students and finding out whether there is significant differences between male and female students′ performance which leads to the level of sociolinguistics competence . 
     A test has been constructed and its validity and reliability have been ascertained  to measure SC among PGSs. Bachman and Palmer (1990:328) scale used to measure SC.

A Quasi-experimental method of research was adopted at the outset of the study. Learners’ recognition and production of the target speech act was measured through MC and WDCTs respectively. Results of the pre-tests were indicative of the groups’ parallel performance on the three sub-strategies of direct, conventionally indirect and non-conventionally indirect requests at both levels of awareness and production. Despite the relatively equal performance of learners at both groups in the pre-test, following the instructional phase, participants in the experimental group exhibited a significant improvement in their awareness and production of requests. This finding was apparent in the significant decrease of direct request strategies in their post-test productions; furthermore regarding the notion of “point of view operation” in requests, members of both groups in the pre-test displayed a high frequency in the utilization of “hearer-oriented requests”; however the experimental group in the post-test relied heavily on the “speaker-oriented” request strategies. With regard to internal and external modifications results evinced high proportion of these strategies in participants’ responses in the pre-test. Inappropriate application of this strategy was seen in several situations in the DCT responses of both groups. However in the post-test the experimental group displayed a modified request behavior by a significant increase in the variety and appropriate use of these strategies.",,10.5861/IJRSLL.2015.1083,https://doi.org/10.5861/IJRSLL.2015.1083,forward
Anders Myrset,2021.0,Scientific concepts as meaning-making resources for young EFL learners in the learning of pragmatics,"This article reports on a study investigating the role of scientific concepts in the metapragmatic awareness of Norwegian primary EFL learners following a four-week instructional intervention on requesting informed by sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 2012/1934). Through introducing pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic dimensions of requesting, the intervention aimed to develop metapragmatic awareness and foster learner agency by teaching pragmalinguistic resources related to request strategies, raising awareness of contextual considerations, and drawing attention to individual perceptions of appropriateness. The instruction focused on scientific concepts, that is, systematic and abstract objects of study which facilitate learner reflections. This article draws on data collected during group interviews to analyse whether learners used scientific concepts introduced during the instruction—for example, directness of the head act and attention getters—and if so, how these were used to express metapragmatic understandings. The analysis shows how such scientific concepts were internalised and used by learners to express their understandings of the importance of linguistic variation and the communicative functions of requests, as well as compare request strategies in English and Norwegian. Lived experiences, contextual considerations, and prior knowledge were also used as frames of reference for interpreting the appropriateness of requests. Adding to pragmatics research using concept-based approaches with (young) adults (e.g., van Compernolle, 2014), this study reveals that internalising a conceptual understanding of pragmatic phenomena in a foreign language is possible even for young language learners, thus contributing to knowledge about how learners come to understand pragmatic phenomena and how pragmatics can be taught with these age groups.",,10.29140/ice.v4n2.485,https://doi.org/10.29140/ice.v4n2.485,forward

"Anna Szczepaniak-Kozak, Emilia Wąsikiewicz-Firlej",2018.0,Pragmatic competence of teachers: a contrastive case study of native and non-native teachers of English,"The existing studies on pragmatic competence of English teachers, e.g., J.

Wąsikiewicz-Firlej (in press), indicate that it is not varied and requires improvement in certain areas. These deficiencies might be interpreted as a result of not only the absence of pragmatic competence (PC) modules in teachertraining education but also a relatively low frequency of English teachers’ contact with native speakers (NS) of English (A. Szczepaniak-Kozak 2010). Nevertheless, we know very little what shape teacher PC takes, including the way it differs from that represented by NSs. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies based on data collected in naturalistic settings (lessons of English). Consequently, this paper attempts to fill in this gap in research by presenting the methodology and conduct of a case study, based on classroom observation of teachers’ pragmatic performance, to investigate whether there are differences in the PC represented by non-native teachers (NNTs) and native teachers (NTs) of English. The findings indicate that NTs do not hold the upper hand in this regard and that a demonstrable linguistic and pragmatic competence, along with appropriate professional training, are better indicators of diverse pragmatic input. On this basis, we propose that some degree of proficiency in pragmatics and its teaching should be a requirement for a certificate or diploma for future foreign language teachers.",,10.32612/UW.25449354.2018.1.PP.127-142,https://doi.org/10.32612/UW.25449354.2018.1.PP.127-142,forward

"Ariadna Sánchez-Hernández, J.

This reality emphasizes the need to help learners of foreign and second languages become not only linguistically competent but also pragmatically competent, in order not to sound impolite or inappropriate in the target language. Addressing this need, studies in interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) have explored which methodology is most effective for teaching pragmatics. Earlier ILP studies compared explicit versus implicit instruction, highlighting the key role of explicit metapragmatic explanations. More recently, scholars have investigated how to create opportunities to for authentic pragmatic practice inside the classroom. To do so, some studies have implemented task-based language teaching to provide students with goal-oriented meaningful activities that address their real-world needs. Other studies have incorporated technology-enhanced materials such as simulated immersive environments and computer-mediated communication to promote students’ engagement in authentic use of the language beyond the classroom. Another current concern in L2 pragmatic instruction is how to account for the emergence of English as an International Language (EIL), and the consequent need to guide learners into acquiring language as a tool to mediate across linguistic and cultural boundaries. Different studies have adopted an EIL perspective, proposing the enhancement of students’ metapragmatic awareness and strategies to deal with the hybrid nature of English and its associated varieties and cultures. The special issue ‘Teaching second language pragmatics in the current era of globalization’ aims to illustrate such current trends, with six contributions by distinguished scholars in the field of L2 pragmatics from all over the globe.",,10.1177/13621688211064931,https://doi.org/10.1177/13621688211064931,forward

Therefore, it is the aim of this study to investigate the issue in Turkish EFL context (i.e. the English request emails of Turkish EFL university students to their non-native professors). Specifically, the extent of directness used and the extent and nature of lexical modification employed by Turkish EFL students to mitigate their requests were examined by using authentic data. The data is a part of natural e-mail corpus of 34 Turkish EFL students’ e-mail requests to their two non-native foreign professors over a period of 2 months at English-medium University in Turkey. First, the corpus was coded via coding schemes, (see Appendices A and C) and ranked with a rubric (Appendix B). The results indicated that the Turkish EFL students’ e-mails involved a) direct strategies rather than conventional indirect strategies, b) overusing direct questions and ‘want’ statements, c) underused query preparatory questions, d) insufficient mitigation causing directness and impoliteness, and e) inappropriate greetings and closing statements affecting degree of direction. It is implicated that e-mail instruction (to recipient in various degrees) should be included in EFL books and curricula.",,10.5539/IES.V9N10P105,https://doi.org/10.5539/IES.V9N10P105,forward

EnglishThe aim of the current study is to investigate the role of second language (L2) proficiency in the pragmatic competence of learners of L2 Greek. More specifically, it aims at exploring whether L2 proficiency can have an impact on the strategies that L2 learners use in order to express the speech act of thanking in L2 Greek. Participants were thirty-one (N=31) learners of Greek at different proficiency levels (from A2 to C2) who were enrolled in a summer intensive course of Greek at a university language school in Athens, Greece. Additionally, a group of native speakers of Greek has been included as a baseline (N=30). Oral data were elicited through a series of open role plays which represented various communicative situations with different social parameters. Furthermore, a retrospective verbal protocol has been used in order to gain more insights into the way L2 learners perform the speech act of thanking. Results showed that there is a difference in the number of strategies of L2 learners across the different proficiency levels, which is more evident between beginners and advanced learners. However, findings seem to suggest that the role of proficiency is not clear-cut and it also depends, firstly, on the social parameters of each communicative situation and also on learners’ familiarization with each situation. The study concludes by discussing some implications for L2 pedagogy. catalaL’objectiu d’aquest estudi preliminar es el d’explorar l’acte de parla de l’agraiment en contextos comunicatius formals.

Specifically, it examined the extent to which instructors of private EFL institutes implement interlanguage pragmatic instruction in their classrooms in Iran. A mixed-method research design was employed in this study. Two hundred and thirty eight instructors participated in this study to collect the questionnaire data and 67 classes were involved in the observation. Questionnaire and observation checklists made up the quantitative instruments for data collection while observation field notes provided the qualitative data.  The quantitative data was subjected to descriptive statistics through the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 21 software and the qualitative data was analyzed based on Martinez-Flor and Uso-Juan’s 6Rs instructional model. Findings from both the quantitative and qualitative data showed that Iranian EFL instructors rarely implemented and practiced the features of inter-language pragmatics in their classes in comparison with other language areas.  The study suggests the inclusion of adequate pragmatic information not only in the instructors’ guidebooks but also in learners’ EFL textbooks and teacher training courses. The quality of EFL teaching can then be further enhanced at the higher learning institutions in EFL contexts.

"Averil Grieve, B. Ta, Bella Ross",2022.0,Placement educators’ perspectives of international social work students’ sociopragmatic communication skills,"International students who speak English as an additional language report experiencing communication issues while completing their studies and work-integrated learning placements in a range of Anglophone countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Australia. To address this issue, accreditation and registration bodies for a number of health professions, such as social work and nursing, have advocated for increasing the test score requirements for university English language entry. However, from a sociolinguistic perspective, decisions concerning ways to address communication challenges need to take into account the unique communication skills required for functioning in specific workplace settings. It is therefore essential to identify the types of communication issues occurring during work-integrated learning opportunities (e.g. placement) and to then assess whether these should be addressed by raising general English proficiency or providing structured learning opportunities for profession-specific communication development within the course content. The present study uses sociolinguistic theory to examine placement educators’ perspectives on international students’ communication issues using the context of social work placement. It draws on the thematic analysis of interviews with 15 placement educators in Australia. One major finding is that international students’ general proficiency or ability to use specific linguistic tools (pragmalinguistic competence) is not a key area of concern for educators. The main challenge seems to involve the students’ understanding of sociocultural norms underlying workplace communication (sociopragmatic competence). This finding suggests that, rather than increasing English language entry requirements, universities need to provide international students opportunities to develop their sociopragmatic competence both before and during placement. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations aimed at supporting international students who speak English as an additional language to develop their workplace communication during their studies.",,10.1007/s10459-022-10155-1,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10459-022-10155-1,forward

The existing studies examined the effects of ESL and EFL settings on pragmatic development from a variety of standpoints. Taking these studies as the basis, this comparative case study aimed to investigate the effects of target context and foreign context on the pragmatic development of two groups of learners, one learning a foreign language (English) and the other learning a second language (Turkish). What differentiates this study from the previous ones is that it compares the cases of learning foreign and second languages (by two different student groups) in the same country (Turkey) The participants, selected on purposeful sampling, were one group of Turkish learners of English in an EFL department in Turkey and the other group was learners from different nationalities learning Turkish in Turkey. The data were collected through participants’ self-reports, interviews and in-class observations by the researcher. The content analysis mainly revealed that the foreign context did not offer learners adequate chances for exposure to and practice in the target language, which negatively influenced their pragmatic development. However, the target context provided ample chances of natural and authentic communication in which learners of Turkish could develop their pragmatic knowledge and production. Based on these results, some pedagogical and practical suggestions are provided.        ",,10.26817/16925777.457,https://doi.org/10.26817/16925777.457,forward

For this reason, this study analyzed a corpus of data from some political press conferences with American and Iranian Government which is randomly selected from appropriate websites between 2007 and 2021. The study applied Clayman, Heritage, and McDonald (2006) for quantifying adversarial questions as exhibited by the press to the questions addressed the Presidents of Iran and the United States. Questions from selected conferences were coded according to adversarialness. Frequency and chi-square tests were used for analysis. The results showed significant difference across the 2 corpora in some journalists’ questions. In terms of question design, accountability questions in Iranian journalists’ questions as Persian corpus indicated higher frequency. In addition, in referencing frames, higher frequency was observed in declarative questions in Persian corpus. However, English corpus displayed higher frequency in other-referencing frames. Finally, in content adversarialness, global adversarialness indicated higher frequency in Persian corpus. Consequently, the results showed that adversarial questions were used in Persian corpus more significantly than English corpus. The results of the study not only will help the students gain linguistic competence, but it will also improve their overall language proficiency.",,10.1155/2022/4674045,https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/4674045,forward

We identify the variables that must be tracked in populations who experience language loss, and we develop a general model for the assessment of the processes involved. This critical review suggests that future research in this domain should establish baselines for attainment against which to measure attrition, and that learners must be compared to themselves in longitudinal designs that involve periodic assessment of both linguistic and extralinguistic factors. In the proposed model, populations are defined as sets of variables, which are subject to change following shifts in discrete time periods in the general process of acquisition and attrition. A working model is elaborated for the assessment of L2 attrition and retention, which, we hope, might encourage additional work in this area.

The study focuses on the need to survey and discuss communicative dynamics in classroom situations and the importance of enhancing cross-cultural pragmatic competence in the English as a foreign language (EFL) context. We believe that enhancing students’ cross-cultural pragmatic competence will provide students with a sustainable learning environment, which is crucial for the quality of education. The investigation involves a mixed approach of quantitative and qualitative methods by using a questionnaire for EFL students and interview guide questions for both EFL students and teachers. For quantitative analysis, the participants involved in this research include 200 EFL students of different nationalities, and for the qualitative analysis, the participants include 10 teachers and 20 EFL students in a university in North Cyprus. The study’s findings indicate that students lack cross-cultural pragmatic knowledge and must be provided with classroom activities for social interaction and to develop explicit and implicit communicative competencies in EFL as a target language. Findings further reveal that EFL students are not endowed with cross-cultural pragmatic competence by the EFL teachers who provide little attention to pragmatic knowledge and classroom activities in the EFL context.",,10.3390/su131810346,https://doi.org/10.3390/su131810346,forward

Within the Moroccan context, despite the increasing interest in the study of pragmatics, most research primarily documents speech acts without adequately considering the students' backgrounds or the received pragmatic input. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the pragmatic input of English speakers in Morocco. Employing a mixed-methods approach, it examines the pragmatic competence of 30 students, including both English majors and non-English majors from various schools in Morocco. A Google form questionnaire was utilized to assess both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic knowledge in relation to pragmatic input. The findings indicate a moderate overall awareness of pragmatics yet reveal significant deficiencies in sociopragmatic awareness, likely attributable to the reported deficiencies in pragmatic input. Notably, the study also shows that students are well aware of and exposed to authentic materials, especially through media, yet they do not focus on the pragmatic aspects of language in favor of other skills. These results underscore the necessity for curricular reforms that integrate pragmatic elements more holistically, particularly pragmatic instruction, thereby paving the way for future research to refine educational strategies and enhance pragmatic proficiency.",,10.32996/ijllt.2024.7.6.7,https://doi.org/10.32996/ijllt.2024.7.6.7,forward

 This article investigates the degree to which second language (L2) learners whose first language (L1) is English access the nonactualization inference that arises at the semantic-pragmatic interface in Korean. As in English, when the modal -eya ha- “should, must” interacts with the past tense, a secondary interpretation that the complement does not hold becomes salient. The results from 12 native speakers of Korean and 16 L2 learners of varying study durations suggested that L2 learners do not compute the secondary inferences in the same way native speakers do, regardless of their study duration. A survey of textbooks frequently adopted in Korean teaching programs across the United States and in South Korea suggests that this nonactualization inference resulting from the interaction of modal and tense is not included as part of the lessons across different levels. The current study argues that this inference should be taught explicitly as part of the language program for the learners, given the frequency of this structure. The study also proposes how and when such secondary meaning should be introduced in language classrooms.",,10.5325/korelangamer.27.1.0001,https://doi.org/10.5325/korelangamer.27.1.0001,forward

Seventeen English learners from a university in Vietnam participated in the 10-week study. The findings revealed that the ERO programme had a generally positive impact on the development of learners’ reading fluency with conservative analysis methods showing increases of around 20% in reading speed. Evidence from qualitative data gathered through questionnaires and interviews showed that there were positive changes in participants’ attitudes toward ER and provided insights into implementing ERO.", Journal Article,10125/67391,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/online-extensive-reading-efl-context/docview/2626907789/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

To examine the frequency of refusal strategies, we conducted a discourse completion test in the L1 and L2 of Russian JFL students and compared them with Russian and Japanese native speakers. The findings show that there is a hierarchical order among the factors involved in realization of request refusals. The effects of cultural and language differences are very complex and deeply intertwined with the content of refusal situations and nature of specific strategies. The results were able to demonstrate in which conditions the following occurred: the influence of L2 (Japanese) onto L1 (Russian), the maintenance of Russian national identity, and the accommodation to the target language culture.", Journal Article,10.17507/jltr.0705.02,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/multivariate-analysis-refusal-strategies-request/docview/1829747886/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

However, less is known about the effectiveness of instruction for disagreements, which are face-threatening acts that establish a point of view counter to the interlocutor. Therefore, the current study explored the effect of explicit instruction with different forms of practice on Colombian EFL learners’ (N = 31) use of politeness strategies when disagreeing. Over a two-week period, a comparison class (n = 8) received explicit instruction only, while two experimental classes received both explicit instruction and practice through task repetition. Whereas the procedural repetition class (n = 12), repeated the same task procedure four times with new content, the content repetition group (n = 11) repeated the same content with different task procedures. The participants carried out a pretest, immediate and delayed posttests, which consisted of discourse completion and role play tasks. The results indicated that the procedural repetition group used significantly more politeness strategies in both the discourse completion tasks and role plays.

Caroline L. Rieger,2018.0,How (not) to be rude: Facilitatingthe acquisition of L2 (im)politeness,"Abstract This article argues for frequent targeted teaching of relational language use or (im)politeness in the L2 classroom. The approach presented here draws on authentic data in the target language and in the language of instruction, which are readily available online. It encourages the learner to make use of their multilingual resources and is exploratory in nature, allowing for a deep engagement with (im)politeness, viz., an extensive array of semiotic features invested in the co-construction of social relations in every social interaction. Working at the interface of (im)politeness studies, intercultural pragmatics, interlanguage pragmatics, and language pedagogy, and undertaken from the perspective of interpersonal pragmatics and relational work, the qualitative analysis focuses on the collaborative work products from participatory learning activities of intermediate to advanced learners of German at a large North-American university. Results show the learners’ raised awareness and broadened knowledge. In particular, learners became aware that what is judged as (im)polite is dependent on the relationship of the interactants, the gender of the interactants, the sociocultural background, norms, values, and believes of the interactants, the context of the interaction, the affiliations of the evaluator, the sociocultural background, norms, values, and believes of the evaluator, etc. Results also suggest that some of the learners need to develop their pragmalinguistic skills further to fully participate in the evaluation of pragmatically rich target language discourse. Additional studies are needed to explore the impact on the learners’ interactional competence.",,10.1515/ip-2018-0023,https://doi.org/10.1515/ip-2018-0023,forward

The present study aimed to discover the language features that can be learned by the Japanese language learners through critical viewing of anime in classroom. A course named ""Learning Japanese language through Anime"" was carried out in one public university in Malaysia for a duration of 10 weeks. Along with the administration of the course, the participants' worksheets on language analysis and learning diaries were collected. The findings showed that language used in anime is more casual in most of the contexts involving daily life. This language use is quite different from what the students usually listen to and use in the classroom where the educators heavily emphasis on the polite ways of speaking using the material designed specifically for pedagogical purposes such as textbooks. Although at times, the language presented in anime maybe even harsh or rough in an exaggerated way, rather than ignore this, it may be better to address it critically under the guidance of educator.", Journal Article,10.17507/jltr.0803.06,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/learning-japanese-through-anime/docview/1917334999/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

It has recently been acknowledged that learners' sensitivity to word-internal structures (morphological awareness) makes an important contribution to L2 lexical inferencing. However, it remains unclear whether the contribution of morphological awareness to lexical inferencing is affected by L2 learner-related factors (e.g., language skills). Data obtained from five paper-pencil tasks in Chinese for 73 L2 learners who studied Chinese for two semesters in China showed that (1) for more-skilled learners, morphological awareness significantly contributed to lexical inferencing with and without contextual cues, whereas no significant relationships existed between morphological awareness and lexical inferencing for less-skilled learners; and (2) L2 learners' morphological awareness does not equally facilitate lexical inferencing due to a possible threshold of linguistic knowledge.

Data were collected from 46 upper-intermediate Korean language learners through three different tools, including Discourse Completion Tasks, metapragmatic questionnaires, and retrospective interviews. Findings showed that the participants chose to resist native Korean pragmatic norms in over 40% of their answers by either adhering to Chinese norms or diverging from both native Chinese and Korean norms. Their decision to resist native Korean pragmatic norms was affected by four main factors, namely the learners' personalities, multilingual identities, ongoing life histories, and relational affordances. These findings indicated that native-speaker pragmatic norms, which are still employed as a model by official Korean proficiency tests, are no longer the default preference of Korean language learners.1 This study thus suggests revising the applicability of native pragmatic norms in Korean language teaching and assessment.", Journal Article,10.1111/flan.12656,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/pragmatic-resistance-chinese-learners-korean/docview/2759068471/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Interpreting the semantic aspects of pitch levels therefore presents a challenge for Korean learners of English. This study investigated how 49 Korean learners of English perceived 20 English emotional utterances. Participants were asked to complete a congruency task in which they indicated whether the category of the semantic valence was congruent with the intonation type. They also described each emotional utterance by providing an adjective. The task results of Korean participants were compared with those of a control group of 49 Anglo-American students. Statistical analyses revealed that the incongruence between the semantic meaning and the intonation type interfered with American participants’ performance more than Korean participants.

"Chung Kam Kwok;Carson, Lorna",2018.0,Integrativeness and intended effort in language learning motivation amongst some young adult learners of Japanese,"Since the 1990s, many researchers in the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) have become focused on second/foreign language learners’ motivation to learn a language, and the role of motivation in determining future success. However, much of the research agenda has revolved around the acquisition of English as an Additional Language, and target languages other than English have been under-researched. This paper reports on a survey study designed to investigate the motivation of 84 beginner learners of Japanese learning the language in a university language centre evening programme. Examining the relationship between learners’ intended effort and six motivational orientations commonly used in SLA motivational studies using multiple linear regression, this study found that integrativeness was the only variable that contributed to learning motivation. This finding is in distinct contrast to studies focused on English learning where the ideal L2 self has often been found to be the best predictor of motivation. While it is far from sufficient to draw a conclusion that Japanese learning motivation is different from that of English based on one study, the current study does point to the key role of cultural identification in second/foreign language motivation, consistent with a small group of other motivational studies conducted in the context of Languages Other than English (LOTEs).", Journal Article,10.1515/cercles-2018-0016,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/integrativeness-intended-effort-language-learning/docview/2167872856/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Es por ello que el conocimiento y la adquisicion de las estrategias de (des)cortesia es central en la integracion de las diferentes comunidades inmigrantes y, por tanto, en la consecucion de la cohesion social. Al mismo tiempo, ya sabemos que la prosodia afecta directamente a los juicios de cortesia en todas las lenguas en las que esta relacion ha sido estudiada, incluido el espanol (Devis 2011; Hidalgo 2009; Albelda 2012). Sin embargo, las senales prosodicas en las que los hablantes de diferentes lenguas se apoyan para juzgar el grado de cortesia parecen no ser las mismas. Mientras los hablantes de espanol como Ll aparentemente se apoyan mas en la entonacion a la hora de juzgar la cortesia de un enunciado en espanol (Devis 2011), los hablantes de chino como Ll parecen apoyarse mas en otros rasgos prosodicos al juzgar el grado de cortesia de un enunciado en chino. Este estudio pretende investigar si los inmigrantes chinos en Espana perciben la diferencia entre peticiones corteses y ordenes descorteses de la misma manera que los hablantes de espanol como Ll, cuando la diferencia entre estas peticiones y ordenes se encuentra unicamente en el nivel prosodico. Para ello, 22 inmigrantes chinos y 26 hablantes de espanol Ll escucharon y juzgaron el nivel de cortesia de 20 pares de ordenes y peticiones producidas por 4 hablantes de espanol Ll de Madrid (2 hombres y 2 mujeres). Los pares de peticiones y ordenes se caracterizaban por ser iguales desde el punto de vista lexico-gramatical y por diferir unicamente en los niveles prosodico y pragmatico. Los analisis estadisticos mostraron que, mientras las ordenes fueron percibidas de manera similar por los inmigrantes chinos y por los hablantes de espanol Ll, los primeros tuvieron problemas para percibir la intencion cortes en las peticiones corteses, que fueron consideradas mas corteses por los hablantes de espanol Ll que por los inmigrantes chinos. EnglishPoliteness plays a key role in cross-cultural communication and Intercultural adaptation (Spencer-Oatey and Franklin 2009). Therefore, knowledge about (im)politeness and the acquisition of politeness strategies is central in the integration of immigrants and the achievement of social cohesion. At the same time, prosody is already known to directly affect politeness judgements in all studied languages, including Ll Spanish (Hidalgo 2009; Devis 2011; Albelda 2012). However, the prosodic cues on which L 1 speakers rely when judging politeness seem to be different for each language. While Ll Spanish speakers seem to rely more on intonation when judging politeness (Devis 2011), Ll Chinese speakers tend to rely more on other prosodic cues when judging politeness in Chinese (Fan and Gu 2016). This study investigates whether Chinese immigrants in Spain perceive the difference between polite requests and impolite commands the same way Ll Spanish speakers do, when the only difference between the commands and requests is at the prosodic level. Chinese immigrants (N = 22) and Ll Spanish speakers (N = 26) listened to and judged the degree of politeness of 20 pairs of commands and requests produced by 4 Ll Spanish speakers (2 male + 2 female) from Madrid. Pairs of commands and requests had the same lexico-grammatical features and only differed at the prosodic and pragmatic levels. Statistical analysis revealed that while commands were perceived very similarly by Chinese immigrants and Ll Spanish speakers, Chinese speakers had problems perceiving the intention in polite requests, which were rated as more polite by Spanish native speakers than by Chinese immigrants.",,10.37536/LYM.12.2.2020.1026,https://doi.org/10.37536/LYM.12.2.2020.1026,forward

The data were collected from a discourse completion test (DCT). Their requestive behaviour is studied in three social and power hierarchical situations (low–high, equal–equal and high–low) in the university context and is compared with a group of native Cantonese speakers' (NCSs) and native English speakers' (NESs) requestive behaviour, respectively. The dual comparison results in three important findings. First, the evidence shows some L1 influence on the syntactic structure of the CLEs' query preparatory strategy. The equivalent interrogative form of (Nei1/Ngo5) ho2 ji5/h2 m ho2 ji5: (you/I) can/can-not-can in Cantonese and Can/Could/May you/I …? in English contributes to the frequent use of the CLEs' indirect requestive behaviour in English. Nevertheless, the difference in direct and indirect strategies between the two groups is significant (p < 0.005). Second, there is cross-cultural agreement on indirect requestive behaviour in the three situations between the CLEs and the NESs. Both groups use the politeness marker of cing2 or please to mitigate imposition and increase politeness. However, the CLEs demonstrate limited pragmalinguistic resources to enhance the force and politeness of the speech act compared to the NESs. The strengths and weaknesses of CLEs' requestive behaviour, their limited pragmalinguistic resources and the limitations of the study are discussed.",,10.1515/mult.2011.005,https://doi.org/10.1515/mult.2011.005,forward

This article examines speech act production in telecollaborative exchange, focusing on the requesting behavior of American learners of German for professional purposes as they interacted with German-speaking professionals in Germany via synchronous Web conferences. Drawing on quantitative and qualitative methods, the study investigated the effect of interaction with expert speakers and the implementation of focused instruction on learners' pragmatic development. Whereas quantitative analysis showed no change between experimental conditions, qualitative analysis of 4 learners' request production over the course of 4 online discussions revealed idiosyncratic developmental pathways and the emergence of a common strategy for managing participation in oral synchronous computer-mediated communication. The findings provide new insight regarding the nature of second language request production and confirm the utility of pragmatics instruction in telecollaboration. At the same time, the study calls for more refined analytical tools when investigating language development in extended telecollaborative discourse.

Research questions ask if learners differ in the transfer of pragmatic knowledge from the L1 or L2 in an oral versus written modality, and if the three learner groups differ in pragmatic expression in the two modalities. Results indicate that the groups respond differently in the two modalities, showing sensitivity to contextual constraints. Few instances of clear transfer are seen, mostly from Spanish at the single-word level. A picture more complex than Kellerman's hypothesis emerges, addressing creative L3 pragmatic and lexical construction. Key words: Portuguese, L3 pragmatic expression of requests, multilingualism, pragmatic transfer, Spanish-speaking L3 Portuguese learners, speech acts Introduction In the learning of a second language (L2), the transfer of knowledge from the adult learner's first language (L1) to an L2 is a process that frequently occurs, as has been demonstrated in several studies on language transfer (Kecskes & Papp, 2000; Odlin, 1989). Transfer, however, has been found to be a complex process. For example, Kellerman (1983) noted the importance of the learner's perception of the typological distance between the L1 and the target language (TL). Learners who know L1 or L2 Spanish undoubtedly perceive a similarity between languages as they learn Portuguese as a third language (L3), because the two languages share many linguistic features and lexical items. One must also consider other factors, such as the learner's tendency to transfer certain linguistic elements of the L1 or L2 grammar and lexicon (e.g., see Cenoz, 2001, for the transfer of content vs. function words), or prepositions and articles as opposed to other grammatical types (Ringbom, 1987, 2001). Koike and Flanzer (2004) examined this question of transfer in the context of L3 Portuguese pragmatic expressions by various categories of Spanish speakers who were beginners in Portuguese learning in order to investigate whether bilingual Spanish-English heritage speakers differ from native English speakers who know L2 Spanish well in their realization of speech acts in L3 Portuguese. They also attempted to discover if these Portuguese learners seemed to transfer from one language in particular, and if they could draw any implications for teaching from such findings. We describe their findings in more detail later on, as they form a point of departure for the present study. In summary, Koike and Flanzer found differences in the written pragmatic production of requests and apologies between bilingual Spanish heritage speakers and native English speakers who know L2 Spanish well in their realization of speech acts in L3 Portuguese. The differences were not substantive, yet the ones that were seen indicated that, in several aspects, the speech acts used by the informants reflected different patterns of pragmatic transfer, illustrating the influence of their base languages. The present study examines the transfer of L1 and L2 pragmatic expressionF realized in the speech act of requestsFin the oral modality by beginning L3 Portuguese learners and compares these findings to data analyzed from the written modality seen in Koike and Flanzer (2004). Others have noted differences in learner production between oral and written contexts (Beebe & Cummings, 1996; Safont Jorda` , 2005), so a comparative study is warranted here. In addition, we target beginning learners because, as noted by Kasper and Rose (1999), there are few studies that investigate pragmatic production at this level of learning. Unlike the Koike and Flanzer (2004) study, in which there were two groups of learners, the participants in the current investigation comprise three groups typical of Portuguese language instruction in the United States: bilingual Spanish heritage speakers (NSH), native English speakers as proficient intermediate and advanced L2 Spanish speakers (NES),1 and native Spanish speakers (NSS). …",,10.1111/J.1944-9720.2011.01115.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1944-9720.2011.01115.X,forward

 Communication Strategies (CSs) to achieve mutual understanding, particularly in ELF contexts. This study explores which CSs were taught in
 recent years in China and how the teaching content is presented in domestic textbooks from an ELF perspective. Ten college English textbooks
 that were published in the past five years (2014–2019) were selected and evaluated based on an adapted framework of CSs. The findings
 revealed a notable inclination toward certain types of macro-strategies and were not systematically mapped out. Moreover, an initial effort
 in manifesting “cultural diversity” was observed but failed to construct intercultural contexts. Knowledge explanation as well as
 student-oriented exercises were found to be conducive in consolidating learners’ acquisition of forms. However, the function and context of
 the target CSs were neglected. Furthermore, an absence of sociocultural pragmatic concern resulted in a discrepancy between explicit
 knowledge explanation and context-based practice. Accordingly, this study suggests implications for both textbook writers and instructors in
 practice.",,10.1075/AP.19031.XIA,https://doi.org/10.1075/AP.19031.XIA,forward

Daniel M. K. Lam,2024.0,Worked examples for peer interaction: a feedback and learning resource,"
 Feedback penetrates many walks of our lives, and its importance in L2 teaching and assessment is well recognised. However, while corrective feedback and writing feedback have been the focus of much L2 research and classroom practice, there seems relatively little attention to feedback on spoken interactional skills. Concomitantly, translating research on interactional competence (IC) to classroom practice has been a glacial process. Aiming at supporting teachers in providing assessment feedback and teaching IC in the classroom, this article introduces worked examples of peer interactions as a feedback and learning resource. Adopting a procedure used in conversation analytic (CA) research, the worked examples are designed to guide learners to notice and understand IC features in context, at a less cognitively demanding pace for processing, and promote learners’ active engagement with the feedback or teaching focus. The article concludes with suggestions for teachers to develop similar resources for their local contexts.",,10.1093/elt/ccae029,https://doi.org/10.1093/elt/ccae029,forward

"Danjo, Chisato",2015.0,"A Critical Ethnographic Inquiry into the Negotiation of Language Practices Among Japanese Multilingual Families in the UK: Discourse, Language Use and Perceptions in the <em>Hoshuko</em> and the Family Home","This thesis is a sociolinguistic examination of the ways in which multilingual children and parents negotiate their language use. Through a critical ethnographic inquiry, it focuses in particular on Japanese-English multilingual parents and their pre- and early-school age children living in the UK, across two fields: a Japanese government approved complementary school (Hoshuko), and the family home where parents employ multilingual family language policies (FLP). My main interest is in exploring the ways in which discourses emerging from the policies (governmental and institutional policies regarding Hoshuko, and FLP) are reproduced and/or challenged by individuals’ situated practices and perceptions. Defining multilingualism as a set of social practices and processes, the thesis explores the following four themes: 1) discourses of Hoshuko policies and of FLP, 2) individuals’ language practices and 3) perceptions in the Hoshuko and in the family home; and 4) the mutual influence of discourses, practices and perceptions. By employing Critical Discourse Analysis to analyse relevant Japanese governmental policy documents, as well as the school prospectuses of all nine Hoshuko in the UK, I disclosed the governmental and institutional discourses (Chapter 4). The discourses were then compared with individuals’ situated practices and perceptions identified at one of those Hoshuko, where I conducted a 16-month ethnographic fieldwork (Chapter 5). The discourse of FLP was also scrutinised by comparing it with family language practices and perceptions in the family home (Chapter 6). As a whole, this thesis reveals discrepancies between the governmental and institutional discourse, as well as individuals’ situated practices and perceptions. On one hand, governmental and institutional discourses are undermined by individuals’ flexible practices in particular situations. On the other hand, multilingual individuals also seem to be influenced by discourses which they reflect in their own perceptions; consequently, some multilingual practices go unacknowledged at the level of perceptions. Overall, this thesis enriches our understanding of the dynamics between macro level ideological influences emerging from policy discourses and micro level practices, and of the complexity of individuals’ perceptions involved in the legitimation of their practices in the context of a complementary school and the family home.", Dissertation/Thesis,,https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/critical-ethnographic-inquiry-into-negotiation/docview/1857773380/se-2?accountid=9902,proquest

"Dehghan, Farzaneh;Rezvani, Reza",2016.0,Transfer at the level of argument structure or morphology: a comparative study of English and Persian unaccusative and unergative verbs,"Transitivity alternation refers to the causative/inchoative alternation of some unaccusative verbs. Different languages use different patterns to show transitivity alternation morphologically. While some languages like English use zero or no overt lexical marking, other languages (e.g. Spanish, Turkish, and Japanese) use overt morphological markers to show transitivity. This study aims to investigate the degree to which similarities and/or mismatches between English and Persian influence the use of unaccusative and unergative verbs by Persianspeaking learners of English. Based on different verb types in English and Persian, seven verb categories were identified as the basis for comparison. A forced-choice elicitation test including 48 items was developed based on these seven verb categories. A proficiency test was also used to divide participants (116 undergraduate students of English) into high and low proficiency groups. The results revealed findings more in line with transfer at the morphological rather than the argument structure level (Montrul, 2000). Alternating unaccusatives with similar equivalent structures for transitive/intransitive pairs in Persian and non-alternating unaccusatives with different structures for transitive/intransitive pairs in Persian seem to be the most difficult verb categories for learners. The effect of proficiency level was also significant on the recognition of correct structures.", Journal Article,10.1515/topling-2016-0008,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/transfer-at-level-argument-structure-morphology/docview/3158214905/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Dheyaa Al-Fatlawi,2018.0,Online sarcasm and its perception by second language learners:the case of Iraqi EFL learners in Iraq and the UK,"Although many studies have been written within L2 pragmatics, very few have dealt with L2 irony and sarcasm. The main purpose of this study is to investigate how EFL learners recognize written British English sarcasm. For this purpose, an L2 pragmatics study was designed and applied to two groups of L2 learners of English. Another purpose of the study is to pragmatically analyse online sarcasm, and see how it is used and by what features it is characterized. A corpus study was conducted for the latter purpose. Regarding data, this study used naturally-occurring sarcasm from real-life situations. The data was collected from a football forum (Manchester United forum; likely used by males) and two parenting forums (Mumsnet and Netmums; likely used by females). These different forums were targeted to ensure a rough gender balance. Sarcasm was identified within these forums by means of a metalanguage strategy. This strategy involved searching for the metalinguistic labels sarcasm and sarcastic, and then extracting and analyzing the antecedent discourses these labels are referring to. Those discourses were considered a potential environment for sarcasm. One hundred and forty two sarcasm-containing threads were collected via the metalanguage strategy. First, the data was pragmatically investigated to reveal the general pragmatic characteristics of sarcasm (e.g. Contradiction: saying something and meaning the opposite or Insincerity: flouting the Gricean quality maxim), as well as its pragmalinguistic characteristics (e.g. hyperbolic expressions, capitalization, exclamation marks) that are used in the data. This is the ‗Corpus Study‘. Second, the analysed data served as an item pool for the judgment task of the L2 pragmatics study. From that pool, 30 items were ultimately selected as stimuli for that L2 study. Two groups of Iraqi EFL learners participated in the L2 pragmatics study. Each group contained 30 participants. The members of the first group were studying L2 English at home (Iraq) and had never been to any English-speaking country. The second group involved learners who received their BA and/or MA degree(s) in English from Iraq and were pursuing MA or PhD degrees at different UK universities. Members of the latter group had 1-4 years sojourn in the UK. A Control group was also provided by 30 British-English native speakers. The 30 stimuli, derived from the online data of the Corpus study, were placed in a two-fold judgement task. The task was designed to: (1) test the participants‘ recognition of sarcasm within the given texts (threads) on a 7-point Likert scale, and (2) reveal what they consider as ‗sarcastic‘ within those texts by highlighting the potentially sarcastic part(s) in them. Results of the corpus study revealed that general pragmatic characteristics bear the greatest load in creating/indicating online sarcasm. Among these characteristics ‗Insincerity‘ seems to be the most fundamental or prototypical one. As for pragmalinguistic characteristics, they appear to play only a minor role in triggering and comprehending online sarcasm. ‗Hyperbole‘ seems to be the most prototypical one among pragmalinguistic characteristics. Regarding the L2 pragmatics study, ANOVA results reveal that both learners‘ groups are significantly different from English Native Speakers. Thus, Iraqi EFL learners appear not to have reached the native level of sarcasm perception. Results also indicate no effect of studying abroad or L2 proficiency upon the sarcasm recognition of those learners. Another finding of the L2 study is that the more characteristics (general pragmatic or pragmalinguistic) available the easier the comprehension of sarcasm turns out to be for both native speakers and learners. However, learners seem to be more sensitive to pragmalinguistic characteristics than English native speakers. They are found to identify sarcasm at the sight of these features more than the native speakers do. More interestingly, the current study has also found out that sarcasm does not always express a negative attitude. Sometimes, it can be used to express a positive emotion in a friendly way. This study encourages further research on L2 sarcasm, particularly with regard to the kind and amount of L2 input the learners are exposed to. It also focuses attention on the necessity of developing the learners‘ L2 pragmatic competence in general and their competence of L2 sarcasm in particular in order to bridge the gap between their performance and that of the native speakers.",,10.17635/lancaster/thesis/262,https://doi.org/10.17635/lancaster/thesis/262,forward
Diana Bravo,2019.0,Los contenidos socioculturales de los actos de habla: el contexto del usuario ideal en cuestionarios de hábitos sociales,"Resumen En este trabajo se aborda la problemática de la universalidad de los actos de habla (Searle, ([1969]1980.

Pragmática sociocultural: estudios del discurso de cortesía en español. Barcelona: Ariel). Dentro de los estudios de orientación pragmática de mayor difusión entre los académicos, encontramos dos posiciones, por un lado la de autores como Leech (([1983] 1988). Principles of Pragmatics. London: Longman.) y Brown y Levinson ([1978] 1987. Politeness. Some Universals in Language Use. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.), que asumen que determinados actos de habla serían inherentemente amenazantes para la mantención de la imagen social (face); por otro, la de Thomas ((1983).

Applied Linguistics, (5), pp. 196–213.), entre otros, para quienes la percepción de los mismos actos en distintas culturas estaría influida por factores socioculturales, de manera que los actos de habla no serían per se amenazantes, sino que esta condición dependería de su interpretación en contexto. Creemos que los actos se describen de modo distinto dependiendo de cuál sea el contexto del usuario ideal, término que refiere al uso habitual de la lengua en su contexto situacional y sociocultural. Por ello sostenemos que no basta con interpretar los actos con la sola ayuda de la bibliografía y de las propias intuiciones, sino que es necesario consultar al usuario de la lengua. En este artículo nos enfocaremos en justificar una metodología de recogida de datos socio-pragmáticos que establece relaciones directas entre los actos y los hábitos sociales de sus usuarios. Nos basaremos en un método de consulta usado por varios autores, el cuestionario de hábitos sociales (cf. Hernández Flores, (2002). La cortesía en la conversación española de familiares y amigos.

Doris Dippold,2010.0,Using speech frames to research interlanguage pragmatics: Facework strategies in L2 German argument,"This paper approaches L2 German argumentative discourse data from Goffman’s notions of face and frames. Face as the social identities and qualities speakers want to have upheld is seen to be associated with frames, i.e. the way speakers frame and interpret an event. Comparing three examples from a cross sectional dataset of discussions on issues surrounding university life, the paper shows that, in each of these cases, speakers applied different frames to the task, resulting in different patterns of turn-taking and modalization. These differences can be explained with the varying degrees of exposure to the target language in classroom and out-of-classroom situations as well as the educational environment in which the data were collected. The paper ends with a number of proposals for research in the field of interlanguage pragmatics, suggesting that politeness and speech act perspectives are insufficient to grasp learners’ real pragmatic intent. Instead, the question of how tasks and situations are interpreted by learners needs to be at the forefront of inquiry, with methods for data collection and analysis aligned properly.",,10.1558/JAPL.V4I3.285,https://doi.org/10.1558/JAPL.V4I3.285,forward

One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted as well to judge statistical significance between contextual variables and categories of refusal and acceptance strategies. Findings indicated that Egyptian EFL learners varied in adopting acceptance strategies, however they tended to use similar strategies for refusing invitations.

"Duff, Patricia A",2014.0,Case Study Research on Language Learning and Use,"Case study research has played a very important role in applied linguistics since the field was established, particularly in studies of language teaching, learning, and use. The case in such studies generally has been a person (e.g., a teacher, learner, speaker, writer, or interlocutor) or a small number of individuals on their own or in a group (e.g., a family, a class, a work team, or a community of practice). The cases are normally studied in depth in order to provide an understanding of individuals' experiences, issues, insights, developmental pathways, or performance within a particular linguistic, social, or educational context. Rather than discuss constructs, hypotheses, and findings in terms of statistical patterns or trends derived from a larger sample or survey of a population of language learners, as in some quantitative research, a qualitative case study of a person presents a contextualized human profile. Case study has contributed substantially to theory development, generating new perspectives or offering a refutation or refinement of earlier theories in applied linguistics by analyzing linguistic, cultural, and social phenomena associated with children, adolescents, young adults, and older adults. In recent years, the purview of case studies in applied linguistics has expanded to include many previously underrepresented topics, linguistic situations, theoretical perspectives, and populations.

Additionally, it also explores whether receptive and productive bilinguals resort to pragmalinguistic, sociopragmatic and linguistic information in different ways during the planning and execution of refusals in English. Ninety-two students of English (52 receptive bilinguals and 40 productive bilinguals of Catalan and Spanish) participated in the study, which involved a one-group pre-test/post-test design and an instructional treatment. Retrospective verbal reports were used to examine the information attended to during the pre-test and post-test role-plays, that is to say, before and after receiving instruction on refusals. Research findings showed that both receptive and productive bilinguals increased their attention and pragmalinguistic awareness of refusals in English, but the latter seemed to display a higher degree of metapragmatic awareness. In addition, productive bilinguals showed higher communicative sensitivity, mainly in the form of concern for the interlocutor’s feelings, and a conversational approach that can be defined as hearer-oriented. Findings of the study add new insights on how bilingualism may influence third language pragmatic learning in instructional settings.",,10.1515/IP-2012-0028,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP-2012-0028,ancestry

Despite the recognized importance of pragmatics, research of textbooks for adult second language (L2) learners to date has found them lacking in their approach to this key aspect of language. However, there is very little research of pragmatics in textbooks for YLLs, which would provide insight into the extent to which these materials can support teachers in including elements of pragmatic competence into their language classes. The present study aims to fill this gap by determining how much pragmatic content is included in 18 textbooks used in Croatian primary schools with learners aged 9–12 years. The textbooks are compared in regard to the percentage of pages with pragmatic content as well as the different speech acts that receive explicit attention in them. The main finding of the study is the great amount of inconsistency when it comes to the scope and treatment of pragmatic content, with some textbooks proving extremely lacking.

E. Kotorova,2021.0,Methodology of Cross-Cultural Description of Speech Behaviour: A Case Study of INVITATION in German and Russian Discourse,"The article aims to demonstrate a consistent methodology for conducting cross-cultural research of verbal communication behaviour and identifying its peculiarities in different language cultures. First of all, the author discusses the problem of defining a basic unit of communication crucial for the analysis of communicative behaviour and proposes her own interpretation of such a unit called speech behaviour pattern (SBP). The illocutionary content and general organization of any SBP is considered universal, while their actual realization in a language is culturally conditioned and therefore may vary significantly in different languages. Utterances that constitute a certain SBP are organized into a field with a prototypical centre and a gradationally formed periphery, which is referred to as communicative-pragmatic field (CPF). The proposed methodology of contrastive analysis includes the following four major components: 1) definition of illocutionary purpose, 2) description of structural forms of SBP (i.e., their lexical and grammatical characteristics), 3) identifying communicative-pragmatic factors, 4) description of the structure and hierarchy of the communicative-pragmatic field that includes utterances implementing SBP. The presented approach is then consistently applied to the analysis of the SBP of invitation in the Russian and German discourse. The language data are taken from the existing Russian and German corpora. The proposed methodology helps to identify the main similarities and differences in the implementation of the SBP invitation in Russian and German driven by grammatical and communicative-pragmatic factors.",,10.17576/GEMA-2021-2101-01,https://doi.org/10.17576/GEMA-2021-2101-01,forward

Four UK-based learners of Korean with competence levels ranging from Novice High through Intermediate High participated in the study, contributing transcripts of CMC interactions and participating in retrospective interviews over a three-month period. Qualitative analysis of the data shows that CMC provided a fertile context for these learners to manifest pragmatic competence in the use of address terms and to progress beyond classroom learning. Address terms also worked as powerful tools for these learners to establish intimate relationships with Korean acquaintances and negotiate identities as legitimate speakers of the language. However, this process of identity negotiation was complicated by gaps in their pragmatic competence, their preexisting identities and differing expectations on the part of Korean interlocutors. Ultimately, the analysis shows that the question of what constitutes “appropriate” use of address terms in CMC interactions involving L2 learners of Korean is unstable and open to negotiation. The implications of this finding for future research and for KSL (Korean as a Second Language) teaching methodologies are addressed in the conclusion.",,10.11139/CJ.31.3.264-284,https://doi.org/10.11139/CJ.31.3.264-284,forward

However, its study in L2 language testing is still scarce. The aim of this paper is to research the extent to which pragmatic competence as defined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) has been accommodated in the task descriptions and rating scales of two of the most popular Oral Proficiency Interviews (OPIs) at a C1 level: Cambridge’s Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) and Trinity’s Integrated Skills in English (ISE) III. To carry out this research, OPI tests are first defined, highlighting their differences from L2 pragmatic tests. After pragmatic competence in the CEFR is examined, focusing on the updates in the new descriptors, CAE and ISE III formats, structure and task characteristics are compared, showing that, while the formats and some characteristics are found to differ, the structures and task types are comparable. Finally, we systematically analyse CEFR pragmatic competence in the task skills and rating scale descriptors of both OPIs. The findings show that the task descriptions incorporate mostly aspects of discourse and design competence. Additionally, we find that each OPI is seen to prioritise different aspects of pragmatic competence within their rating scale, with CAE focusing mostly on discourse competence and fluency, and ISE III on functional competence. Our study shows that the tests fail to fully accommodate all aspects of pragmatic competence in the task skills and rating scales, although the aspects they do incorporate follow the CEFR descriptors on pragmatic competence. It also reveals a mismatch between the task competences being tested and the rating scale.

Elizabeth Mokoro,2024.0,Pragmatic Competence in Second Language Learners,"Purpose: The general objective of the study was to analyze pragmatic competence in second language learners. 
Methodology: The study adopted a desktop research methodology. Desk research refers to secondary data or that which can be collected without fieldwork. Desk research is basically involved in collecting data from existing resources hence it is often considered a low cost technique as compared to field research, as the main cost is involved in executive’s time, telephone charges and directories. Thus, the study relied on already published studies, reports and statistics. This secondary data was easily accessed through the online journals and library. 
Findings: The findings reveal that there exists a contextual and methodological gap relating to pragmatic competence in second language learners. Preliminary empirical review revealed that pragmatic competence is crucial for effective communication in a second language, often lacking in learners despite their grammatical proficiency. Explicit instruction in pragmatic norms and strategies significantly improved learners' communication abilities. Cultural immersion and authentic language use were found essential for developing practical pragmatic skills. The study also highlighted the importance of considering individual differences, such as motivation and language aptitude, to tailor instruction and enhance pragmatic training effectively. 
Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The Speech Act Theory, Politeness Theory and Socio-Cultural Theory may be used to anchor future studies on pragmatic competence in second language learners. The study highlighted the need for a broader theoretical understanding that integrates sociolinguistics and cognitive sciences, recommended incorporating pragmatic skills into language curricula through authentic dialogues and interactive activities, and advocated for policies that prioritize pragmatic competence in language proficiency standards and assessments. It emphasized the importance of cross-cultural awareness and recommended collaborative efforts among educators, researchers, and policymakers to develop comprehensive frameworks. The study also suggested ongoing research to monitor the effectiveness of these changes and adapt educational practices accordingly.",,10.47941/ejl.2044,https://doi.org/10.47941/ejl.2044,forward

The tool serves the final exam of a course offered to second-year students of English language and literature. Of the three parts of the exam, (1) reading, (2) language awareness, and (3) writing, the third part (language awareness) explicitly addresses students' pragmatic competence. In the light of our work, assessing students' pragmatic competence is shown to involve the identification of certain levels of competence ensuing from the interpretive routes learners follow in their attempt to (a) interpret the communicator's intention, (b) identify the linguistic devices that lead them to this interpretation, and (c) explicitly verbalize the link between linguistic devices and interpretation. The suggested ranking of levels draws on data from statistical analysis of 190 final exam scripts. The proposed assessment of pragmatic competence manifested when dealing with written discourse is considered to be an innovative testing tool, because it is a discourse-based approach to testing pragmatic competence, where both explicit and implicit meanings are retrieved by drawing on a naturally-occurring wide range of lexical and grammatical features. More importantly, the proposed assessment constitutes an accurate testing tool because it allows for levels of pragmatic, hence linguistic, competence to naturally unveil in an authentic reading context requesting the reader's spontaneous reaction and contribution to the process of meaning making in L2.",,10.1515/IP-2012-0003,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP-2012-0003,forward
Emi Fukasawa,2019.0,Changes in Speech Acts During Study Abroad Programs: Japanese Students Studying in the United States and Australia,"This paper details an exploration into changes in speech acts and interactions in English (i.e., requests and refusals) in nonclassroom interactions before and after study abroad programs. I transcribed role-plays of two Japanese students before and after they completed study abroad programs in the United States and Australia, carried out periodic online interviews during their stays overseas, and conducted follow-up interviews once they returned to Japan. The results show that changes in the use of expressions occurred for three reasons: 1) input-initiated changes from noticing form–meaning–function relationships, 2) instruction-initiated changes, and 3) output-initiated changes. Because some of the changes were problematic and led to misunderstandings or impoliteness, I conclude that learning from natural input alone is not sufficient to learn how to navigate between function and situation. Therefore, the results suggest that explicit feedback and instructions in classrooms are important before and during study abroad programs.

Emily Black,2017.0,Extending talk on a prescribed discussion topic in a learner-native speaker eTandem learning task,"Abstract Opportunities for language learners to access authentic input and engage in consequential interactions with native speakers of their target language abound in this era of computer mediated communication. Synchronous audio/video calling software represents one opportunity to access such input and address the challenges of developing pragmatic and interactional competence (Barron and Black 2015, Constructing small talk in learner-native speaker voice-based telecollaboration: A focus on topic management and backchanneling. System 48. 112–128). The synthesis of telecollaborative technology with the development of pragmatic and interactional competence is an area of burgeoning research (Taguchi 2011, Teaching pragmatics: Trends and issues. Annual Review of Applied Linguistics 31. 289–310). The present study represents a contribution to this growing area set in the particular context of an eTandem partnership. Data is drawn from Language LINC, a corpus of telecollaborative eTandem interactions between German-speaking learners of English and English-speaking learners of German. The eTandem meetings that comprise this corpus were centred around tasks to be completed for the students’ respective language classes. The study investigates how learners and native speakers manage a pre-specified discussion topic set for the English portion of an eTandem meeting. As the topic is prescribed, it imposes constraints on the students’ interactions and requires them to continue talk on this topic for an extended amount of time. Student participants delimit their talk by clearly initiating and later closing down the topic. Within these boundaries, questions are used as a resource to confront the interactional problem of extending talk on the prescribed topic.",,10.1515/cercles-2017-0005,https://doi.org/10.1515/cercles-2017-0005,forward

Specifically, this article discusses the teaching of “challenging” incongruent speech behaviours (such as sarcasm, banter, and irony) in a group of Anglo-Norman dialogues of the late Middle Ages. The present work focuses on the representation of incongruent speech acts in the dialogues, how this representation speaks to a pedagogical method that incorporated humour, and also the possible functions of humour in the pedagogical environment. The topic of incongruent performance and its pedagogical implications will also be considered. By discussing the depiction and role of incongruent speech behaviours in the dialogues, I argue that these texts were sophisticated teaching aides that may have used humour as a pedagogical tool to teach more difficult elements of language use.",,10.1515/multi-2018-0095,https://doi.org/10.1515/multi-2018-0095,forward

Three qualitative conclusions are arrived at in connection with and emerging from interpretations of the textual data: (1) the speech acts produced by the participants used various structures such as statements, questions, commands, instructions, prohibition and description; (2) the speech acts denoted various kinds of communicative or speech functions like expressives, directives, representatives, referentials, comissives, and metalinguistics; and (3) the occurrence of one particular communicative function can dynamically entail specific kinds of communicative functions in the light of the available context.  Some categories of speech functions were not consistent with the purpose of the communicative event of thesis examination.",,10.26418/jeltim.v1i2.33263,https://doi.org/10.26418/jeltim.v1i2.33263,forward

Esther Usó-Juan,2013.0,Effects of Metapragmatic Instruction on EFL Learners' Production of Refusals,"Research into the teaching/leaming of pragmatic competence in both second and foreign language contexts has shown, in general, that simple exposure to input is insufficient for learners to develop pragmatic competence (Rose, 2005) and therefore, instruction in pragmatics is necessary to facilitate the learning of this competence in order to use language appropriately. In an attempt to expand this line of research, the present study examines the effects of explicit instruction through metapragmatic information on learners' production of an under-researched speech act, that of refusals. Pedagogical intervention is organized progressively in six steps: Researching, Reflecting, Receiving, Reasoning, Rehearsing and Revising (MartinezFlor and Uso-Juan, 2006). These steps are designed to help learners understand the form-function relationship of refusals in different social contexts. Participants' performance in pre- and post-test was compared. Results showed the benefits that this pedagogical proposal can have on learners' pragmatic production of refusals.1 IntroductionOver the last few decades, specifically after the original formulation of the notion of communicative competence (Hymes, 1972), the seminal description of its components for pedagogical purposes (Canale, 1983; Canale and Swain, 1980) and the emphasis placed on the component of pragmatic competence (Bachman, 1990), one of the main goals of language teaching professionals is the development of learners' communicative competence in a second (L2) or foreign (FL) language. As recent models of communicative competence have shown (Celce-Murcia, 2007; Uso-Juan and Martinez-Flor, 2006), communicating appropriately and effectively in the target language requires not only mastery over the features of the language system but also over the pragmatic rules of language use. It is necessary to learn how to use and understand language that is appropriate to the contextual and cultural parameters of the specific situation, because failure to do so may characterize non-native speakers as being insensitive, rude or even offensive. Given this necessity, instruction in pragmatics has been a major concern in communicative language teaching (Martinez-Flor and Uso-Juan, 2010), but still language teachers hesitate to incorporate pragmatics in their classrooms. This hesitation, as summarized by Liu (2010), could be attributed to: i) inadequacy of the description models offered by theoretical pragmaticists (Thomas, 1983); ii) difficulty of teaching pragmatics since it involves a high degree of 'face threat' (Matsuda, 1999); iii) lack of available pedagogical resources for teaching pragmatics (Matsuda, 1999) and iv) lack of valid methods for testing pragmatics (Liu, 2006). Consequently, more interventional studies on pragmatic development that utilize research-based teaching materials and different testing methods should be conducted to inform language educators.Guided by this theoretical framework, the present study attempts to determine the effectiveness of pragmatic instruction on a group of Spanish learners studying English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in relation to the speech act of refusals to requests. The rationale behind the selection of this speech act derives from the fact that, given its face-threatening nature, learners need to possess considerable pragmatic expertise to be able to perform it successfully. To this end, this chapter first presents an overview of the most pertinent research on teaching English refusals to L2/FL learners. Following this, it describes the study with a detailed explanation of the participants, the instructional treatment, the instrument and procedures for data collection and data analysis. Finally, the findings obtained by means of analyzing learners' responses in the pre- and post-test are presented and discussed.2 Literature review on teaching English refusalsA refusal is a speech act that functions as a response to an initiating act such as a request, an invitation, an offer or a suggestion. …",,10.1163/9789401209717_006,https://doi.org/10.1163/9789401209717_006,ancestry

Drawing on Taguchi’s (2018) classification of pragmatics learning strategies, the instructional intervention followed a strategy-based approach to help learners understand the form–function–context mapping of email requests in the academic context. A total of 110 naturally occurring email requests for action addressed to three faculty members were collected at two different times: as a pre-test (i.e. before engaging learners in the instructional period), and as a post-test (i.e. after learners’ participation in the treatment sessions). Learners’ email messages were analysed considering both their appropriateness of use as well the frequency of utilization of different structural (i.e. subject line, openings and closings) and content components (i.e. request strategies and internal request modifiers). Results showed that strategy instruction helped learners write more appropriate email requests after the instructional period. The findings suggest that arming learners with a variety of strategic tools may lead to pragmatic development in actual language use.",,10.1177/13621688211066997,https://doi.org/10.1177/13621688211066997,forward

Eva Alcón-Soler,2017.0,Pragmatic Development During Study Abroad: An Analysis of Spanish Teenagers’ Request Strategies in English Emails,"ABSTRACT Previous research has shown that adolescent second language learners benefit from pragmatic instruction during study abroad (Alcón-Soler, 2015). As a follow-up investigation, the present study looked at late adolescent study-abroad learners, and it examined both the immediate effect of pragmatic instruction and the pragmatic trajectories that adolescent learners follow once they move from the instructional context to real email communication. Email requests in English produced by 60 (30 treatment and 30 control) Spanish teenagers studying in England were analyzed with regard to the impact of instruction on the frequency of indirect request strategies and internal modifiers. In addition, the pragmatic trajectories of two learners—one high producer and one low producer of request modifiers—were analyzed qualitatively on four separate occasions during the study-abroad experience. The findings show the positive effects of instruction on learners’ use of indirect request strategies and request modifiers. However, there is no homogeneous pattern of change during participants’ study-abroad experiences. Closer examinations of the pragmatic trajectories of two learners show that learners’ perceptions of request imposition or their desire to be accepted in the community in which they find themselves may explain pragmatic changes.",,10.1017/S0267190517000125,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190517000125,forward

"Eva Alcón-Soler, J. R. G. Pitarch",2013.0,The Effect of Instruction on Learners' Use and Negotiation of Refusals,"Research into Interlanguage Pragmatics has often focused on the effect of instruction on speech act production. However, features related to the interactive nature of conversation are rarely used in most of the pedagogical proposals for teaching the speech acts. Considering research outcomes on the benefits of pragmatic instruction, the need to conduct pragmatic intervention at the discourse level (Felix-Brasdefer, 2006b; Kasper, 2006) and the value of audiovisual input as a source of pragmatic input (Alcon, 2007; Fernandez-Guerra, 2008; Martinez-Flor, 2008), the present study focuses on the effect of instruction on learners' use of refusal strategies and concern for pragmatics. Alcon's (forthcoming) pedagogical proposal for teaching the speech act of refusals at the discourse level is used during the instructional treatment. In addition, pragmatic input is provided for the present study by means of scenes from the series Stargate, which were controlled for speech act type (refusals to requests) and social distance (+ power and + social distance). Findings from the study support Schmidt's (1993, 1995, 2001) noticing hypothesis, thus providing further evidence that high levels of attention-drawing activities are helpful for pragmatic learning. In addition to the differences as regards learners' use of refusal strategies, learners' attempts to accommodate the non-compliant nature of the speech act of refusals seem to have also been influenced by the teaching of refusals at the discourse level.1 IntroductionResearch into Interlanguage Pragmatics (ILP) has often focused on speech act production. Speech acts such as requests, apologies, complaints and refusals have received a great deal of attention over the years, but most of these studies ignore the interactive nature of conversation in their analyses of speech acts. Similarly, features related to the interactive nature of conversation are rarely used in most of the pedagogical proposals for teaching the speech acts or in most studies on speech act instruction (Martinez-Flor and Alcon, 2007, on suggestions; Olshtain and Cohen, 1990, on apologies; Rose and Ng Kwai-Fun, 2001, on compliments and compliment responses; Alcon, 2005, 2008; Martinez-Flor, 2007; Safont, 2005, 2007; Salazar, 2007; Takahashi, 2001; Uso-Juan, 2007, on requests; Kondo, 2008, on refusals). In addition, although results of these studies support Schmidt's (1993, 1995, 2001) noticing hypothesis and provide evidence of the positive effect of instruction (see also Alcon and MartinezFlor, 2005, 2008; Codina, 2008; Jeon and Kaya, 2006; Rose and Kasper, 2001; Takahashi, 2010), they ignore the interactive nature of conversation and the potential of teaching pragmatics at the discourse level.In the case of refusals, and as reported by Gass and Houck (1999: 2), the complexity of the speech act requires ""face-saving manoeuvres to accommodate the non-compliant nature of the act"". Most of the research on refusals has applied or adapted Beebe et a/.'s (1990) taxonomy, thereby focusing on semantic formulas, especially when dealing with learners or when contrasting NS and NNS use (see Al-Eryani, 2007; Al-Issa, 2003; AlKahtani, 2005; Felix-Brasdefer, 2003, 2006a; Geyang, 2007; Keshawarz, Eslami and Ghahraman, 2006; King and Silver, 1993; Kondo, 2001, 2008; Kwon, 2004; Salazar et al., 2009, among others). However, Felix-Brasdefer (2009) shows clearly that refusals function as a response to an initiating act and they are co-constructed by two or more interlocutors over multiple turns. In a similar line and in the area of language pedagogy, Felix-Brasdefer (2006b) and Alcon (forthcoming) present pedagogical models for teaching refusals at the discourse level. Felix-Brasdefer (2006b) presents three pedagogical sessions for teaching the negotiation of refusals across multiple turns in Spanish. The first one, communicative actions and cross-cultural awareness, focuses on cross-cultural awareness of refusing in English and Spanish, as well as providing pragmalinguistic input on refusals. …",,10.1163/9789401209717_005,https://doi.org/10.1163/9789401209717_005,ancestry
"Eva Ogiermann, S. Bella",2020.0,"An Interlanguage Study of Request Perspective: Evidence from German, Greek, Polish and Russian Learners of English","
The present study examines request perspective, the least researched form of mitigation in requesting, while focusing on a type of request characterized by a strong preference for speaker perspective in English and for hearer perspective in most other languages researched to date. It examines requests produced by 900 speakers from nine different (inter)language groups: five groups of native speakers (English, German, Greek, Polish and Russian) and four groups of advanced learners of English as a foreign language (German, Greek, Polish and Russian L1s).
While our learners used more conventionally indirect forms than did the native speakers of the respective L1s, showing awareness of this English pragmatic norm, they retained a preference for the hearer perspective. These results suggest reliance on pragmatic universals as an alternative explanation to pragmatic transfer, also illustrating the need to address less salient pragmatic features in English language teaching.",,10.1163/26660393-bja10003,https://doi.org/10.1163/26660393-bja10003,forward

Educators as well as researchers exploring a new domain of inquiry may rely on the conclusions from meta-analytic reviews rather than reading multiple primary studies. This article calls for caution in this regard because the outcome of a meta-analysis is determined by how effect sizes are calculated, how factors are defined, and how studies are selected for inclusion. Three recently published meta-analyses are reexamined to illustrate these issues. The first illustrates the risk of conflating effect sizes from studies with different design features; the second illustrates problems with delineating the variable of interest, with implications for cause-effect relations; and the third illustrates the challenge of determining the eligibility of candidate studies. Replication attempts yield outcomes that differ from the three original meta-analyses, suggesting also that conclusions drawn from meta-analyses need to be interpreted cautiously.",,10.1017/S0272263120000327,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263120000327,forward

The participants’ English language proficiency, as determined by an IELTS test sample, was intermediate, and then they were randomly split into two groups, namely experimental and control. Before and after the treatment, a Written Discourse Completion Test (WDCT) served as a pre-and post-test given to the two groups to assess statistically significant differences between them. The experimental group received direct instruction on request and suggestion speech acts via the presentation of the carefully chosen movie and TV series clips. In contrast, the control group was exposed to a minimal amount of pragmatics through printed texts. The findings demonstrated that the experimental group outperformed the control group. More precisely, the findings revealed that movie and TV series clips had a significant influence on learners’ production of requests and suggestions. Considering the above findings, the researchers propose EFL teachers apply movie and TV series clips to improve their Students’ pragmatic competence in class.",,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.974757,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.974757,forward

The results show that the reliability of the test reaches ?=.798 which means it is acceptable for a language test. Further development of test items is required to achieve more adequate test reliability. The findings also suggest that learners' pragmatic knowledge can be influenced by both study-abroad experience and linguistic competence. These factors may contribute to learners' ability to appropriately respond to pragmatic utterances from the test. Thus, language learners should focus on increasing their linguistic proficiency to enhance their understanding and use of pragmatic language.

Flack, Saira B S Karrim",2017.0,Facilitating pragmatic skills through role-play in learners with language learning disability,"Background Role-based learning involves the process whereby learners acquire skills, knowledge and understanding through the assumption of roles within real-life settings. Role-play holds potential as an effective learning strategy for children; however, there is limited research on the use of role-play as a therapy method within the field of speech-language pathology. Children with language learning disability (LLD) typically present with difficulties in social communication, which can negatively affect their social and academic achievement. Aim The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of role-play as a therapy approach targeting the pragmatic skills of stylistic variation and requesting for clarification in learners with LLD. Method The use of combined positivist and interpretivist paradigms allowed for the implementation of an embedded mixed methods design. An experimental pretest-posttest design was implemented. Eight participants, who were learners with a diagnosis of LLD, were purposefully selected. Data collection was conducted over five phases, utilising the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (4th Ed.) Pragmatics Profile, discourse completion tasks, session plans and session records. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and were supplemented by qualitative data from session records. Results Results revealed improvements in stylistic variation and requesting for clarification post role-play intervention, with minimal changes in the control group. Limitations of the study have been reported for consideration when interpreting results. Conclusion Role-play as a therapy approach targeting two pragmatic skills, stylistic variation and requesting for clarification, was found to be beneficial for learners with LLD. Recommendations for the implementation of role-play as a therapy approach were made.",,10.4102/sajcd.v64i1.187,https://doi.org/10.4102/sajcd.v64i1.187,forward

The analysis is divided into two parts: the first investigates distributional frequencies of nine central modals across the two corpora; the second explores and compares the semantics of four selected modal auxiliaries (must, can, may, and should) in the two corpora. If it is assumed that textbooks should be an accurate reflection of authentic native speakers’ language use, then support for the acquisition of modality in the textbooks proved to be less than ideal. Although there is a reasonably good coverage of modals in the textbooks in terms of frequency, the semantic analysis reveals discrepancies between the native corpus and the textbooks. Learners are exposed to a limited range of meanings that do not fully reflect authentic use. Findings are also discussed from an alternate perspective whereby strong representations of potentially difficult to acquire uses of modals in the textbooks can be seen as beneficial for acquisition.Résumé:Les auteures étudient la modalité dans les manuels destinés aux apprenants de l’anglais en analysant la fréquence et la distribution des verbes modaux dans deux corpora—celui de la langue des locuteurs natifs authentiques et celui, pédagogique, qu’utilisent les apprenants francophones de l’anglais au Québec—, dans le but de définir les domaines dans lesquels une aide supplémentaire à l’apprentissage pourrait être bénéfique. L’analyse se divise en deux volets : dans le premier, les auteures étudient la distribution des fréquences de neuf expressions centrales de la modalité dans les deux corpora ; dans le second volet, elles explorent et comparent la sémantique de quatre auxiliaires modaux sélectionnés (must, can, may et should) dans les deux corpora.

Feng Xiao,2015.0,Adult Second Language Learners' Pragmatic Development in the Study-Abroad Context: A Review.,"The ability to use language effectively in communication is regarded as important as knowledge of grammatical rules in the communicative competence models (Bachman & Palmer, 1996, 2010; Canale & Swain, 1980). Pragmatic competence, namely the ability to understand and use linguistic forms appropriately according to context, is thus accepted as a vital component of language ability (e.g., Bachman & Palmer, 1996, 2010). Recently, pragmatic competence and development have captured growing interest among L2 pragmatics research (for a review, see Kasper & Rose, 1999, 2002; Kasper & Roever, 2005; Taguchi, 2010). Specifically, a series of studies have been conducted in the study abroad (SA) context (e.g., Barron, 2003; Iwasaki, 2010; Kinginger, 2008; Matsumura, 2001, 2003; Schauer, 2006a, 2006b; Taguchi, 2008a, 2008b), because, compared to a domestic classroom setting, the SA context is believed to provide greater opportunities to communicate with native speakers, and these opportunities are assumed to lead to pragmatic gains (Kinginger, 2008, 2009). For example, expressions such as “would you+verb” and “could I +verb” are usually used to make a request, and expression like “why not+verb” and “how about +verb” are often interpreted as suggestions. This conventional language use for pragmatics is recurrent in the target-language community, providing learners more exposure to such language use and consequently, more opportunities to use such conventional pragmatic expressions in context.",,10.36366/frontiers.v25i1.349,https://doi.org/10.36366/frontiers.v25i1.349,forward

However, increased proficiency does not guarantee a native-like pragmatic performance because proficiency effect varies depending on the nature of target pragmatic features such as types of speech acts (degrees of directness and conventionality) (e.g., Cook & Liddicoat, 2002; Felix-Brasdefer, 2007), modalities of pragmatic performance (comprehension and production) (e.g., Bradovi-Harlig, 2008, 2009), social variables involved in task situations, such as social status (e.g., Allami & Naeimi, 2011), social distance (e.g., Maeshiba, Yoshinaga, Kasper, & Ross, 1996), and power relationship (e.g., Al-Gahtani & Roever, 2012).

Communicating feelings through language in cross-cultural interactions,"Abstract This study examines cross-cultural communication in English between Americans and Brazilians through the lens of intercultural pragmatics. Three groups of speakers participated: native speakers of American English, native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, and English learners who spoke Brazilian Portuguese as a first language. Using a mixed design including role plays and interviews and both quantitative and qualitative data, the study identified pragmatic transfer among the ESL learners, who also showed evidence of developing awareness of the sociolinguistic norms of the target language and its speakers.",,10.1515/ijsl.2011.013,https://doi.org/10.1515/ijsl.2011.013,forward

The theme of the conference was Integrating informal learning into formal language education. 
 
As contact time with students is increasingly reduced in higher education, teachers are looking at ways to support their students with resources that can be used outside the classroom. This means that many teachers are looking at approaches such as flipping the classroom or initiatives like the use of social media to access resources or interact with peers or native speakers, telecollaboration activities between learners in different countries, or the co-creation of learning artefacts such as videos, websites, or texts. The incorporation of such activities into the curriculum blurs the boundaries between formal and informal activity. 
 
The chapters in this book provide insights into many types of these innovative approaches to teaching languages at university and beyond. The contributing authors have experimented with new strategies to enrich their students’ learning experience or identified new ways of using existing resources in and outside the classroom.",,10.14705/RPNET.2018.22.9782490057108,https://doi.org/10.14705/RPNET.2018.22.9782490057108,forward

Towards that aim a description of the circumstancesin which the concept of communicative competence emerged ispresented in addition to two different models of communicativecompetence: the model of Canale and Swain (1980, 1983) and themodel of Bachman (1990). As a consequence of the role pragmaticcompetence plays to help learners be communicatively competent,the area of learners’ interlanguage pragmatics has gained increasedattention. Observational and interventional studies have beenconducted to understand the process of pragmatic acquisition.Factors that influence the learning of pragmatics have beenidentified, and issues related to the teachability of pragmatics andtesting pragmatic ability have been tackled.",,10.38169/0661-000-022-013,https://doi.org/10.38169/0661-000-022-013,forward
Fred Seizo Tsutagawa,2013.0,Pragmatic Knowledge and Ability in the Applied Linguistics and Second Language Assessment Literature: A Review,"Almost forty years after Stalnaker’s (1974) initial call for “the development and application of a pragmatic theory in which detailed explanations of phenomena relating to linguistic contexts can be given” (p. 214), a unifying construct definition and theory still does not exist to explain fully pragmatic knowledge and ability (Roever, 2011, 2013). Given that test validity and reliability are crucial concerns in the field of second language (L2) assessment, it is important that we try to develop a more comprehensive theoretical construct, so that tests of pragmatic ability will have more construct validity, better represent the target language use (TLU) domain of the test construct, and thus have results that are hopefully more generalizable and useful to stakeholders. This paper presents a brief review of the extensive pragmatics literature and examines how the construct of pragmatic knowledge and ability has been operationalized from the perspective of theoretical and applied linguists. The paper presents (1) an introduction to the theoretical foundations of pragmatics, (2) a brief survey of applied empirical studies in L2 pragmatics, and (3) an overview of how the L2 assessment field has conceptualized pragmatic knowledge and ability, looking also at the various theoretical frameworks that have been proposed and utilized. Validation studies for the assessment models, although scarce, are discussed where appropriate. Lastly, some general ideas and suggestions are offered to help lead us towards a unifying construct definition of pragmatic knowledge and ability.",,10.7916/D8BZ65NN,https://doi.org/10.7916/D8BZ65NN,forward
"G. Berent, R. Kelly, Tanya Schueler-Choukairi",2012.0,L2 AND DEAF LEARNERS’ KNOWLEDGE OF NUMERICALLY QUANTIFIED ENGLISH SENTENCES,"This study assessed knowledge of numerically quantified English sentences in two learner populations—second language (L2) learners and deaf learners—whose acquisition of English occurs under conditions of restricted access to the target language input. Under the experimental test conditions, interlanguage parallels were predicted to arise from acquisitional pressures imposed by derivational economy on universal grammar (UG)–guided semantic interpretation. The results of a task in which participants matched sentences to multiple discourse depictions confirmed the predicted parallels. However, in matching underinformative sentences to depicted contexts, the L2 and deaf learner groups overactivated discourse-pragmatic knowledge. The restriction of indefinite noun phrases to singleton indefinites and the cancellation of scalar implicatures rendered sentences more informative in underinformative contexts, producing incorrect—although principled—interpretations. These results inform English acquisition at the interface of semantics and discourse pragmatics and provide further support that economy pressures yield L2 learner and deaf learner interlanguage parallels as observed, for instance, in learners’ interpretative knowledge of universally quantified English sentences.",,10.1017/S0272263111000490,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263111000490,forward

It highlights how this microblogging and social networking service provides authentic settings that are both dynamic and communicative, and which facilitate the cultural enrichment of first-year French learners, by enhancing their socio-pragmatic awareness and developing their multiliteracy skills in a second language. We argue for the importance of making students aware of this linguistic culture from an early stage of their language studies. This invisible second language culture is rarely discussed in traditional classrooms and only sporadically presented in foreign language textbooks; however, it can easily be experienced in digital environments like Twitter, making it an ideal context for such exposure. Our results suggest that the incorporation of linguistic cultural elements is indispensable to the development of intercultural communicative competence, a skill that paves the way for successful communication across national boundaries and in different electronic discourses.

This article investigates whether a social networking community (SNC) website such as Facebook can be exploited in the context of an intermediate foreign language class to promote competent, literate L2 learners. Intermediate language learners had to search groups in Facebook that were linked to the course themes and conduct a linguistic analysis focusing on greetings, leave-takings, and vocabulary selection in order to identify the language typically used in this electronic environment.

Familiarisation with these norms is also an important aspect of socialisation for native speakers entering a new community of practice. This study focuses on pragmatic instruction of English as an additional language and native speaker learners preparing to enter undergraduate study. In particular, the instruction focused on one community of practice which undergraduates typically encounter: groups undertaking joint projects. The instruction was explicit, drawing on semiauthentic and naturalistic scripted samples of discourse relevant to the target community of practice. This report considers six cases of the total 15 participants in order to explore changes in their pragmatic competence and ability to participate effectively in the target community of practice. The data are derived from pre- and post group discussions and discourse completion tasks as well as post instruction participant reflections on group negotiations and intercultural communication. Instruction was found to have had a positive impact on the pragmatic competence of these participants as well as raising their awareness of cultural differences as they learned to interact in an intercultural third place.

Gabriel Bărbuleț,2024.0,Pragmatic strategies in teaching the Romanian language to international students,"The following paper examines effective language-teaching strategies for international students learning Romanian amidst the increasing globalization. Addressing challenges faced by diverse learners, the study employs a methodology encompassing literature review, classroom observations, and interviews with experienced instructors. Emphasizing the importance of pragmatic elements in language instruction, the research explores the integration of technology, cultural immersion, and real-world applications to enhance pragmatic competence. Grounded in sociolinguistic theories, the article underscores the role of pragmatic competence in effective communication. Beyond linguistic structures, language instructors are urged to incorporate nuanced elements reflecting Romanian culture. Pedagogical strategies tailored to international students include task-based activities, role-playing, and language immersion. Assessment involves qualitative analysis of student performance, feedback, and proficiency assessments. The article also delves into the role of technology, discussing the integration of virtual reality, online platforms, and multimedia resources for immersive learning. The study concludes with implications for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers, advocating for culturally sensitive language curricula. Overall, it contributes to the discourse on language education by emphasizing the interconnectedness of language and culture, promoting pedagogical approaches that foster cross-cultural communication.

"Gabriele, Alison",2010.0,Deriving meaning through context: Interpreting bare nominals in second language Japanese,"Previous studies on the second language acquisition of telicity have suggested that learners can use morphosyntactic cues to interpret sentences as telic or atelic even in cases where the cues differ in the first language (L1) and second language (L2) (Slabakova, 2001, 2005; Gabriele, 2008; Kaku et al., 2008a, 2008b). The present study extends this line of research by focusing on a case in which learners cannot rely on morphosyntactic cues in order to reach the appropriate aspectual interpretation. We examine the acquisition of telicity by English-speaking learners of Japanese, focusing on how learners interpret bare count nouns such as kaado 'card' that obligatorily display count noun morphosyntax in English. In Japanese, a bare noun such as kaado is ambiguous with respect to number and therefore a verb phrase such as kaado-o kakimashita 'wrote card' can be interpreted as either telic 'wrote the cards' or atelic 'wrote cards' depending on the context. The results of two studies with both intermediate (Study 1: n = 38; Study 2: n = 38) and advanced (Study 1: n = 7; Study 2: n = 10) learners of Japanese show that there are learners at both levels of proficiency that have difficulty with the interpretation of bare count nouns and assign an exclusively telic reading to a verb phrase such as kaado-o kakimashita 'wrote card'. We argue that this interpretation is due to the boundedness of count nouns in L1 English and propose that a retreat from negative transfer is difficult when there is variability in the native speaker input and when meaning has to be derived from context in the absence of morphosyntactic cues.

Twenty eight Saudi female students in the Preparatory Year (PY) at King Saud university, were randomly selected to conduct an oral information-gap task. The participants were asked to perform the task two times with two-week interval between the two performances. The oral performances were transcribed and analyzed to measure fluency and accuracy of language output. The collected data were coded for the two dimensions of oral production (fluency and accuracy), based on the established criteria. A within group dependent t-test for paired samples was computed to find out whether there were significant differences between the mean scores of the first and the second performances. The findings revealed that task repetition resulted in significant differences in the subjects’ oral discourse in terms of fluency and accuracy.

Ten Chinese students who are currently studying at Northern Arizona University (NAU) were invited to participate in the research. They had different lengths of residence in the United States ranging from one year to five years. Based on Lu’s (2014) study on the same group of students, the length of residence in English immersive environment should be positively correlated to comprehensibility and intelligibility and only slightly correlated to accentedness. The investigator of this study collected the amount of time each spends on nine critical daily life activities in a regular semester. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to demonstrate the relationship between English speaking competence and the time devoted to each of the nine activities. Follow-up interviews were conducted to each participant to qualitatively reinforce and verify the statistical results.

Gillian Mansfield,2014.0,Mind the gap between form and function. Teaching pragmatics with the British sitcom in the foreign language classroom,"Abstract This article intends to show how situation comedies may be used in the English language classroom to develop awareness-raising activities aimed at soliciting an understanding of essentially pragmatic and cultural aspects of everyday language. After a brief overview of studies on pragmatic teachability (Rose and Kasper 2001, 2002) and learnability (Taguchi 2011) in the language classroom over the last twenty years or so, verbal humour in situation comedy will be investigated with a view to presenting learners with the kinds of word play that are clearly intended to invoke laughter. With reference to a second-year degree course in modern languages at the University of Parma (Italy), it will be seen how learners can be motivated to resort to previously acquired theoretical knowledge of various pragmatic expedients (Brown and Levinson 1978; Leech 1983; Levinson 1984; Yule 1996) with a view to recognizing the intended illocutionary force of utterances and exchanges in the light of Grice's (1975) co-operative principle in conversation. This approach is justified by Bouton's (1994) claim that an understanding of implicature is a necessary learning target. Although it comprises written-to-be-spoken text, the situation comedy is an excellent source of “real” everyday language in which Grice's maxims are constantly broken or flouted through intentional ambiguity for the purposes of provoking laughter. By encouraging learners to perceive the fuzzy line of demarcation between the form and communicative function of words and phrases in the ongoing exchange structure of a conversation, it will be possible to see how they become more motivated to search for examples of their own (Bardovi-Harlig 1996) and discuss them with the teacher during their post-course assessment. The teacher is thus able not only to discern whether learners have effectively become more aware of the subtleties and implicatures of language meaning in the creation of verbal humour, but also incidentally, benefit from a subsequent addition to her sitcom corpus for future courses.",,10.1515/cercles-2013-0020,https://doi.org/10.1515/cercles-2013-0020,forward

This article explores the possibility of using pause placement in writing process data to determine the likelihood that a multiword unit is processed as a whole in the mind. The data are texts produced by learners of English and corresponding keylog files from the Process Corpus of English in Education (PROCEED). N-grams are selected on the basis of the finished texts and retrieved from the keylogging data. The pause placement patterns of these n-grams are coded and serve as a basis to compute the Pause Placement and Processing (PPP) score. This score relies on the assumption that n-grams which are delineated but not interrupted by pauses (hence taking the form of ‘bursts of writing’) are more likely to be processed holistically. The PPP score points to structurally complete n-grams such as in fact and first of all as being more likely to be processed holistically than structurally incomplete n-grams such as that we and to the .

"Gomez-Laich, Maria Pia",2016.0,Second language learners’ divergence from target language pragmatic norms,"Pragmatic competence is an indispensable aspect of language ability in order for second and foreign language (L2/FL) learners to understand and be understood in their interactions with both native and nonnative speakers of the target language. Without a proper understanding of the pragmatic rules in the target language, learners may run the risk of coming across as insensitive and rude. Several researchers (Bardovi-Harlig, 2001; Kasper &amp; Rose, 2002) suggest that L2 pragmatics not only can be taught in the L2/FL classroom, but, more importantly, that explicit approaches that involve direct explanation of target pragmatic features are beneficial for learning pragmatics. Just as native speakers of a language acquire a “set of dispositions to act in certain ways, which generates cognitive and bodily practices in the individual” (Watts, 2003, p. 149), instructors can help learners to become aware of the pragmatic features that characterize the target language. Although the importance of explicit teaching of pragmatics is well recognized in the literature, learning norms and rules of pragmatics largely depends on learners’ subjectivity. Learners’ convergence or divergence from the L2 pragmatic norms, both consciously and out of awareness, sometimes depends on whether these norms fit their image of self and their L1 cultural identity. Since identity-related conflict can have significant consequences for the acquisition of second language pragmatics, failing to consider the centrality of learners’ identities will produce an inadequate understanding of SLA. This paper synthesizes studies that document the reasons why learners opt to remain foreign by resisting certain L2 practices. The following synthesis question was proposed: Why do language learners resist the pragmatic norms of the target language?", Journal Article,10.14746/ssllt.2016.6.2.4,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/second-language-learners-divergence-target/docview/2771779465/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Native English speakers in at-home and study-abroad contexts were tested twice during a semester of Japanese study on their ability to judge the correctness of and categorize nouns by their pitch pattern. Regression analyses indicated that the ability to store nonnative-like sound sequences in phonological short-term memory (PSTM), as well as auditory processing ability, predicted a significant degree of perceptual gains made over a 12-week interval. However, these predictors were task specific in that PSTM capacity predicted correctness judgment gains, while auditory processing accounted for variation in categorization. Furthermore, despite learners in the at-home context performing slightly better overall, processing resources adhered to the same predictive pattern when context was taken into account. The results suggest that (a) neither increased input during study-abroad nor targeted instruction is sufficient for most learners to acquire lexical accent; (b) processing resources support the acquisition of lexical prosody, but these may depend on how learning is assessed; and (c) PSTM operates across learning contexts, suggesting it to be a domain-general capacity in early-stage nonnative language acquisition.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0142716419000377,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/exploring-variation-nonnative-japanese-learners/docview/2342975396/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

A lexical search was carried out in various corpora from the newspaper genre using the verbs congratulate in English and its dictionary counterparts tebrik etmek and kutlamak in Turkish along with their various lexical forms, which not only report the act of congratulating but also perform it. The results of the study showed that there were cultural differences and similarities in the conceptualization of congratulatory happy events. It was found that there were subtle differences between the events of tebrik etmek and kutlamak in the Turkish data and that the Turkish tebrik etmek was closer to congratulating although congratulating events were relatively more restricted.

I reexamined their procedures, and reassessed the 49 unique samples they used in their meta-analysis. In doing so, I identified three key methodological limitations with the study, pertaining, respectively, to (a) the data collection procedure, (b) the coding system, and (c) the statistical analysis. I argue that the lack of data quality inherent in the primary studies, the oversimplified coding scheme, and the inappropriate use of effect size statistics combine to compromise the validity of the conclusions Norris and Ortega have drawn from their meta-analysis. I subsequently provide alternative procedures which may yield a more empirically sound research synthesis, recommending, for future meta-analysts, the „best evidence synthesis‟ approach where conclusions are drawn from combining quantitative and qualitative analyses.",,10.7916/D84M9H5B,https://doi.org/10.7916/D84M9H5B,forward

They completed morphological awareness measurements (morpheme segmentation, morpheme analysis and homophone awareness), cognate awareness measurements that tapped into three different types of bilingual cognates, as well as two word-learning measurements (definitional knowledge and lexical inference). Drawing upon multivariate regression analysis, the study demonstrated that cognate awareness contributed to L2 Japanese word learning. Awareness of false cognates yielded stronger predictions in both outcome measurements. Regarding morphological awareness, the study indicated that morphological awareness had a unique contribution to L2 Japanese word learning above and beyond cognate awareness. More specifically, the findings underscored the importance of morpheme analysis and homophone awareness in Japanese word learning.",,10.1080/13670050.2022.2157203,https://doi.org/10.1080/13670050.2022.2157203,forward

"Hae Ree Jun;Mu, Bing",2024.0,An Ecological Perspective on Agency: L2 Learners’ Sociopragmatic Interpretations and Strategies in a Study Abroad Context,"In applied linguistics, there has been a growing body of L2 pragmatics studies that investigate the intricate relationship between language learners’ subjective pragmatic choices and various contextual factors. The current study contributes to the understanding of language learner agency by illustrating the complex processes through which language learners enact their agency in response to varying contextual factors when making their sociopragmatic interpretations and strategies. To capture the ecological nature of agency, this study conceptualizes agency as contextually, interpersonally, intrapersonally, spatially, and temporally embedded. Through the in-depth examination of the accounts of three L2 learners of Japanese regarding their interactions with religious group members during their study abroad in Japan, this study demonstrates language learners’ divergent ways of enacting their agency, stemming from their orientations to the unique configurations of various contextual attributes in the L2 interactions. Such differences were rooted in and guided by their past experiences, present environments, and future aspirations that impacted their sociopragmatic perceptions, expectations, and choices. This study provides a complicated picture of language learner agency as a dialogic and reflexive process in which learners interact with contextual factors and adapt their sociopragmatic choices. Thus, it calls for an ecological, processual, and holistic approach to language learner agency through the close examination of the ways in which various contextual factors come together in L2 interactions, the process of how language learners orient to dynamic configurations of contextual factors, and what guides such orientations.", Journal Article,10.3390/languages9050174,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/ecological-perspective-on-agency-l2-learners/docview/3059527212/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Furthermore, the projects introduced in Section C enable students who come from a language background other than English to apply whatever they have understood of Sections A and B to their own language and culture. While I commend the authors for addressing immensely interesting topics in their book, I have one suggestion for its future editions. The sheer excellence of the book forces the reader to wonder why the notion of vagueness, especially intentional vagueness, has not received the attention it deserves. As the authors would probably agree, there have been some useful investigations into vagueness in communication (e.g. Channell, 1994; Cutting, 2007). Therefore, I suggest that, in line with this healthy tradition of research, a separate unit be devoted to the introduction and analysis of vague language. Overall, Archer, Aijmer and Wichmann successfully make a close and strong connection between theory and practice in their book. Besides being a very informative and thought-provoking contribution, their book suggests points of departure for further research and suitable topics for discussion in advanced seminars. This book helps us to broaden our understanding of the use of language in context and is thus essential reading for undergraduate and graduate students of language as well as for teachers.

Conversational implicatures, in general, do not bring problems for native speakers but they become problematic for second language learners. Through this study, we attempt to measure and explain second language learners' comprehension on idiomatic implicatures. The inquiry covers to what extent second language learners comprehend idiomatic implicatures and what strategies the learners to interpret this type of implicatures use.

Furthermore, task-based games in language learning have the potential to motivate and engage learners in meaningful learning while promoting autonomy and reducing anxiety, particularly among second language learners. It was also discovered that digital game-based learning is more effective than non-digital game-based learning because non-digital game-based learning cannot cover all critical elements of TBLT during implementation.

Building on theories of multimodal learning, the present study explored how auditory, visual and gestural training of Japanese pitch accent affected behavioral, neural and meta-cognitive aspects of pitch perception across two experiments. Experiment 1 used a between-subjects pre/posttest design to train native English speakers to perceive Japanese pitch accents in one of the following three conditions: (1) baseline (audio + flat notation), (2) pitch height notation (audio + notation mimicking pitch height) and (3) pitch height notation + a left-hand gesture (L-gesture) (to engage the contralateral right hemisphere specialized for suprasegmental pitch processing). Our results indicated that (2) pitch height notation training was most robust in its benefits, as participants in this condition improved on trained and novel words alike. Experiment 2 used a within-subjects design to extend Experiment 1 in three ways: adding a right-hand gesture (R-gesture) condition (to engage more segmental language areas in the left hemisphere), introducing a neural correlate of cognitive load (measured by EEG alpha and theta power) and performing a metacognitive subjective assessment of learning (e.g., ‘Which training did you find the most helpful?’). The results showed that although there were no differences among our four training conditions on learning outcomes or EEG power, participants made the most positive subjective evaluations about pitch height notation and R-gesture training. Together, the results suggest that there may be a ‘just right’ amount of multimodal instruction to boost learning and increase engagement during foreign language pitch instruction.", Journal Article,10.1017/langcog.2024.24,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/multimodal-training-on-l2-japanese-pitch-accent/docview/3141169010/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Sixty native English speakers participated in 1 of 4 types of training: (a) audio-only; (b) audio-mouth; (c) audio-hands; and (d) audio-mouth-hands. Before and after training, participants were given phoneme perception tests that measured their ability to identify short and long vowels in Japanese (e.g., /kato/ vs. /kato:/). Although all 4 groups improved from pre- to posttest (replicating previous research), the participants in the audio-mouth condition improved more than those in the audio-only condition, whereas the 2 conditions involving hand gestures did not.

It aims to examine the most appropriate strategies used by 2nd year students of English as compared to those of 4th year when refusing their interlocutors' invitation, suggestion, and offer. WDCT questionnaire was used to collect data from 40 Iraqi undergraduate students of English: 20 2nd year and 20 4th year. Adopting Beebe et al.'s (1990) theory of refusal, data collected was analyzed quantitatively using statistical analysis. The findings revealed that the 2nd year students of English were more frequent in using direct refusals than their 4th year counterparts. This means the latter were more aware of using refusals politely than the former. On the other hand, the findings showed that 4th year students more frequent in their use of indirect refusal strategies that the 2nd year students. This indicates that the EFL learners of low proficiency level might not bridge the gap between the pragmalinguistic strategies and the grammatical form of the target language. This means that they were not pragmatically competent of the use of the appropriate pragmalinguistic strategies. This implies that the 2nd year students need to pay more attention to pragmatics and use their refusal strategies appropriately. Thus, the paper recommends conducting further research on the use of refusal speech act in Arabic and English.",,10.14500/kujhss.v3n1y2020.pp166-173,https://doi.org/10.14500/kujhss.v3n1y2020.pp166-173,forward
"Hyejin Cho, Youjin Kim, Seyoung Park",2021.0,Comparing students’ responses to synchronous written corrective feedback during individual and collaborative writing tasks,"Abstract The present study examined students’ attention to linguistic forms during writing tasks and compared individual and collaborative writing conditions. Furthermore, the ways students in both conditions process indirect synchronous written corrective feedback (SWCF) and the ways they respond to it (i.e., uptake) were investigated. The target linguistic forms were Korean honorifics, which are closely related to Korean culture, honoring the elderly by using a different set of linguistic features. Twenty-nine learners of Korean were divided into two groups: collaborative and individual writing groups. The collaborative group completed e-mail writing tasks in pairs, whereas students in the individual group carried out the same tasks alone. During the tasks, indirect SWCF was provided on the target pragmatic features (i.e., honorifics). Think-aloud protocols and pair talk were audio-recorded. Students’ attention to linguistic forms was operationalized as the occurrence of language-related episodes (LREs), and their processing of SWCF was determined using feedback-related episodes (FREs). Uptake was identified based on students’ final writing output. The findings suggest that the collaborative group resolved linguistic errors more accurately than the individual group. In terms of the linguistic target features and uptake of SWCF, both groups demonstrated similar patterns, suggesting mediating effects of SWCF on students’ task performance.",,10.1080/09658416.2021.1937194,https://doi.org/10.1080/09658416.2021.1937194,forward
Hyekyeng Kim,2016.0,An Investigation into EFL Learners’ Perception towards L2 Pragmatic Instruction,"The present study investigated EFL students’ perception toward the pragmatic instruction provided as a part of regular English curricula. A total of 52 university students from various majors participated in the study. The treatment was given for nine weeks during the regular class hours in terms of four speech acts, compliments, apologies, requests, and refusals, with the goal of enhancing the learners’ pragmatic awareness as well as pragmatic competence. A questionnaire and the learners’ reflection journals were adopted as data collection instruments, and an eclectic design was adopted to analyze their perception. Both the intermediate and low groups showed positive perception in terms of the four major categories—interest, usefulness, importance, and motivation, yet more than half of the learners from the low group found that learning L2 pragmatics was difficult due to the complexity and length of some of the sentence patterns of formulaic expressions. Further, there were significant differences between subjects regarding the category of difficulty for each speech act. Nevertheless, the learners expressed that pragmatic instruction facilitated their communication skills, enhanced their pragmatic awareness on intercultural differences, as well as instilled confidence in English interactions. These findings imply learners’ motivation and needs for learning L2 pragmatic features.",,10.17507/TPLS.0603.02,https://doi.org/10.17507/TPLS.0603.02,forward
Hyekyeng Kim,2017.0,THE EFFECTS OF PRAGMATIC INSTRUCTION ON THE PRAGMATIC AWARENESS AND PRODUCTION OF KOREAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS,"Despite the ongoing research of interlanguage pragmatics, intervention studies concerning pragmatic instruction have not been conducted as actively. The present study aims to investigate the effects of pragmatic instruction on Korean university students specifically regarding compliment responses. The effects of the instruction were examined in terms of the students' pragmatic awareness and production, according to the various language proficiency levels of the students. A total of 106 Korean university students from various majors participated in the study. The experimental group received explicit pragmatic instruction, which entailed metapragmatic instruction, awareness raising activities, and output practice regarding compliment responses, whereas the control group was exposed to the target features with no explicit instruction. A set of pragmatic awareness questionnaire and discourse completion tasks were administered as the data collection instruments and an eclectic design was adopted to analyze the effects of the instruction regarding their pragmatic awareness and production. The results indicate that explicit pragmatic instruction provided positive effects for raising the level of pragmatic awareness in the low group. Additionally, both the intermediate and low groups showed a significant improvement in production, as confirmed by the examination between and within subjects, and also displayed a range of formulaic expressions with a less idiosyncrasy attributed to first language transfer. These results call for further attention to pragmatics in second language (L2) teaching and learning.",,10.17509/IJAL.V7I2.8136,https://doi.org/10.17509/IJAL.V7I2.8136,forward
I. Kecskés,2015.0,How does pragmatic competence develop in bilinguals?†,"This paper aims to discuss how the emerging new language with its own developing socio-cultural foundation affects the existing L1-governed knowledge and pragmatic competence of adult sequential bilinguals. It is assumed that these bilinguals already have an L1-governed pragmatic competence at place, which will be adjusted to accommodate the socio-cultural requirements of the new language. So there is no separate L2 pragmatic competence. What happens is that the existing L1-governed pragmatic competence becomes bilingual pragmatic competence while changing dynamically under the influence of the new language and its socio-cultural requirements and behaviour patterns blending the emerging features and skills with the existing ones. I will argue that there is a basic difference between the development of pragmatic competence in L1 and the sequential development of bilingual pragmatic competence. While the former is controlled mainly by the socio-cultural environment the latter is mostly motivated by individual will and preference. In the L1 language development and social development go hand in hand as a mostly subconscious, automatic and instinctive process in which individual consciousness and willingness to acquire social skills and knowledge play a relatively limited role. The whole process depends mainly on exposure to and nature of socio-cultural environment. Bilingual pragmatic competence, however, develops differently. When the new language is added gradually the existing L1-governed pragmatic competence is affected (besides exposure to L2 and environment) and motivated by individual control, consciousness and willingness to modify existing skills and behaviour patterns and acquire particular social skills and ignore others. This is not to say that the socio-cultural exposure and environment is not important. It of course is. However, it appears that there is more individual control included in bilingual pragmatic development than is the case in L1 pragmatic development.",,10.1080/14790718.2015.1071018,https://doi.org/10.1080/14790718.2015.1071018,forward

Yet how does it emerge in pragmatically mature but linguistically developing adult L2 learners? We used one comprehension and two production tasks, based on Falkum and colleagues (2017), to investigate metonymy abilities in 34 Japanese adult learners of English as an additional language (EAL) and a control group of 31 native English speakers. We also examined how time constraints and exposure to examples of referential metonymy affected production. In the comprehension task, both EAL-learner and native-speaker participants chose metonymic readings at above chance levels. In both production tasks, all participants produced innovative metonyms. Additionally, the findings indicate that, in L2, exposure to examples dramatically increases metonymy production, while time pressure decreases it. The results suggest that participants can both comprehend and produce novel metonyms in L2, with a possible explicitness vs. production costs trade-off.", Journal Article,10.1017/langcog.2021.4,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/i-moustache-returns-referential-metonymy/docview/2789810133/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Ilka Floeck, Joanna Pfingsthorn",2016.0,Comparing Instrument-induced Effects in EFL Requests: Task-based Approach versus Discourse Completion Task,": In Interlanguage Pragmatics (ILP) research, the Discourse Completion Task (DCT) is the main source of insight into speakers’ productions of pragmatic phenomena. Its omnipresence as a means of data collection can be explained by the need of comparability of data sets and (sociolinguistic) variable control. However, some studies suggest a discrepancy between surface realisations observed in naturally occurring data and experimental data like DCTs (cf. e.g. Beebe and Cummings 1996; Golato 2003).Unfortunately, the results of these studies are inconclusive and do not offer any information about quantitative differences in realisation patterns and about the impact of different methodological approaches on interlanguage data. It is therefore the aim of the present study to compare the influence of two methods of data collection, DCTs and task-based elicited conversations, on the realisation of the head act strategies in requests produced by advanced learners of English. Overall, our results show a significant difference in the distributions of request head act strategies across the two methodological conditions. The conversational head acts are substantially more direct than the requests elicited by DCTs. The patterns observed in learner data strongly resemble the ones found in native speaker requests in the same methodological scenarios. This implies that despite earlier claims, advanced learners can display target-like language use. The resemblances furthermore indicate that semi-naturalistic methods of data collection are a more valid means to obtain learner data that is representative of naturally occurring conversations.",,10.19195/0301-7966.54.4,https://doi.org/10.19195/0301-7966.54.4,forward

Irina Ivanova,2018.0,Teachers’ Perceptions Of The Role Of Pragmatics In The EFL Classroom,"The need to prepare foreign language learners for successful cross-cultural communication increases the importance of developing their pragmatic competence. However, due to different factors, classroom procedures are still largely dominated by form-focused instruction and manipulation, and the focus on pragmatic phenomena remains somewhat neglected or marginalised. The present study looks into teachers’ awareness of the pragmatic domain and its impact on their attitudes and approaches to developing the pragmatic component of communicative competence. Data analysis showed that most of the teachers are aware of the main issues involved in teaching pragmatic competence. They were able to name different speech acts and give a variety of appropriate examples. However, about 43% couldn’t name any speech acts or gave wrong answers. Teachers’ awareness of pragmatic appropriacy was demonstrated in the extensive lists of topics and behaviours which they considered inappropriate in cross-cultural encounters.",,10.46687/silc.2018.v03.003,https://doi.org/10.46687/silc.2018.v03.003,forward
"Isgandar Bababayli, Nalan Kızıltan",2020.0,A comparative sociopragmatic analysis of the dialogues in Turkish and Azerbaijani B1-B2 EFL textbooks,"Different communities assess social distance, social power, rights and obligations, and degree of imposition used in specific speech acts differently. As a result of this difference, foreign language learners are likely to make sociopragmatic failure. This kind of failure is harder to correct because of the learners’ justifiable sensitivity in social (or political, religious, and moral) matters. Nevertheless, the research has proven the effectiveness of instruction on development of learners’ awareness of sociopragmatic aspects of language use. However, there is almost no investigation on the representation of sociopragmatic variables in second or foreign language textbooks. Considering that textbooks are essential for providing input for the learners in development of their sociopragmatic competence, we compared EFL textbooks designed for and employed in public schools of Turkey with those designed for and employed in public schools of Azerbaijan, to evaluate how sociopragmatic and related variables have been addressed in dialogues present in these textbooks. The results of the investigation revealed that there are some significant differences between Turkish and Azerbaijani textbooks regarding representation of speech acts, vertical distance, and strength of socially defined rights and obligations. These differences, on the other hand, can be accounted for by the inadequate representation of speech situations. By this study, we aspired to draw textbook writers’ attention to such inadequacies elimination of which may result in sociopragmatically more adequate textbooks, and attract second- or foreign language teachers and learners’ attention on the significance of sociopragmatic competence for appropriate language use.",,10.17263/JLLS.803869,https://doi.org/10.17263/JLLS.803869,forward

(Cognition, 151, 68-75, 2016), and as compared with the listeners' native tongue (L1 Japanese). In the experiment, listeners listened to locally time-reversed words and pseudowords in their L2 English and L1 Japanese where every 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, or 110 ms of speech signal was flipped in time-these stimuli contained either many fricatives or stops. The results suggested that the intelligibility of locally time-reversed words and pseudowords deteriorated as the length of reversed segments increased in both listeners' L2 English and L1 Japanese, while listeners understood locally time-reversed speech more in their L1 Japanese. In addition, lexical context supported perceptual restoration in both listeners' L1 Japanese and L2 English, while phonemic constituents affected perceptual restoration significantly only in listeners' L1. On the other hand, locally time-reversed words and pseudowords in L1 Japanese were much more intelligible than those in L1 English reported in Ishida et al. It is possible that the intelligibility of temporally distorted lexical items depends on the structure of basic linguistic units in each language, and the Japanese language might have a unique characteristic because of its CV and V structure.", Journal Article,10.3758/s13414-021-02258-5,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/perceptual-restoration-locally-time-reversed/docview/2555688360/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

These styles, which are often associated with formal or informal contexts, also index complex social and situational meanings, and native speakers are reported to shift their styles to create desired contexts. In order to better understand L2 development of the use of the plain and polite styles during study abroad, the current study examined the use of the polite/plain styles and style shifts among five English-speaking male students who studied in Japan for one academic year by comparing their performances both quantitatively and qualitatively in oral proficiency interviews before and after they studied abroad. Upon return, three predominantly used the polite style talking to the interviewer (their former teacher), while two primarily used the plain style. Though the quantitative analysis may lead one to conclude that these two students regressed in their pragmatic competence, the qualitative analysis revealed that all five learners gained some understanding of social meanings of the plain and polite styles and became more active social agents who make decisions to shift the styles."," Article , Report",10.1093/applin/amn047,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/style-shifts-among-japanese-learners-before-after/docview/61807181/se-2?accountid=9902,eric

We will then present ways for teaching grammar as a communicative resource through a look at the pragmatic functions of grammatical expressions used to express communicative action, such as the conditional, the imperfect, tag questions, impersonal expressions, and adverbials. The importance of classroom input and the role of pragmatic variation when teaching pragmatics in the classroom are also addressed. Finally, we propose a four-step pedagogical model for the teaching of pragmatics with online activities that can be used directly in the classroom, and this article closes with a recommendation that pragmatics be integrated into the language curriculum.",,10.1353/HPN.2012.0124,https://doi.org/10.1353/HPN.2012.0124,forward

Second, we undertake a corpus-based study of the speech act-indicating interactional uses of ‘don’t worry’, fangxin and bie-danxin, teasing out their conventional uses.

In order to find a fitting methodology, and in the absence of any guidance within applied linguistics, we willingly delved into challenging techniques and debates from other disciplines. A few years later, we had to search long and hard to find enough synthesists working on language learning and teaching issues to warrant a book, but we did, and we saw that new effort as an important, if initial, step towards the adoption and adaptation of research synthesis, and particularly the subset of methods known as meta-analysis, to the problems of applied linguistics. Now, some ten years after our first publication on the topic, applications of meta-analysis have increased dramatically in the field, as this Timeline clearly shows. For some topics (e.g. interaction, corrective feedback), we have even seen several studies replicating and building on each other. We are pleased with these developments and welcome the efforts of the field to engage in rigorous and meaningful reviews of L2 research, with an eye towards cumulative explanation of key phenomena. At the same time, we also hope that researchers will avail themselves of the full potential of systematic research synthesis, which considerably transcends the narrower domain of meta-analysis and includes other quantitative as well as qualitative methods that more fully enable the task of synthesizing accumulated knowledge in the increasingly diverse research landscape of applied linguistics.",,10.1017/S0261444810000200,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0261444810000200,forward

Zhao (2003) notes that CMC research is limited in terms of investigating the effects these types of discussions have on other features of language development. Even so, the existing research indicates a positive connection between the use of written chat and oral production (e.g., Healy-Beauvois, 1997; Payne & Whitney, 2002). However, no other investigations specifically address the effects of CMC (written or oral) on pragmatic acquisition. In this study, two classes of third-semester Spanish students (N = 27) participated in small group discussions as well as pre and post role-play tasks that elicited the invitation refusal. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of these role plays illustrate that synchronous discussion type does have an effect on pragmatic development.

As a language learner, being able to use different modes of communication for remote participation, understanding authentic electronic discourses, and engaging in digital communities are essential for success in our technology-saturated world. Thus, expanding one’s language repertoire to adapt to a multiplicity of communicative contexts is fundamental. Participating in a multilingual world is usually understood as being able to speak a language (i.e., having language fluency, and sometimes accuracy as well as complexity). We know, however, that being a competent speaker of a language involves more than being fluent. As González-Lloret (2019) points out, a capable speaker needs to engage in appropriate language use to effectively accomplish any communicative act. A speaker that is grammatically competent but inappropriate will be regarded as impolite or unfriendly (Thomas, 1983). This may have critical consequences, especially in high-stakes situations such as business interactions, formal introductions, and work interviews.

For example, knowing how to play guitar may help a person who is learning to play the piano, or experience playing team sports may help a person who has a job that involves teamwork, or having learned math in school may help a person who is shopping. Questions about whether and how learning is applied in different contexts are central to an understanding of human behavior, and answers to such questions are of practical value to educators.

To this end, students at a Midwestern college engaged in live video chat pre-test conversations in Spanish in which a native speaker was instructed to compliment the student as to naturally assess the response. The student was not aware that s/he would be complimented; as such, this tool may be the most authentic way to assess student pragmatic proficiency within a classroom setting. For comparison purposes, a multiple choice test was also administered. After the pretests, pragmatic interventions on compliment sequences were presented in class, followed by a repeat of the pretests (now posttests). Growth between the tests was the main focus of the data analysis process. Statistical and anecdotal results indicate that the pragmatic lessons greatly increased the students’ ability to recognise appropriate compliment sequences in Spanish, but not to produce them. While these findings are not groundbreaking, the innovative nature of the assessment method used should encourage future researchers to use similar assessment techniques for measuring pragmatic proficiency.",,10.1080/09571736.2019.1709887,https://doi.org/10.1080/09571736.2019.1709887,forward

Ji Young Kim,2023.0,Spanish–English Cross-Linguistic Influence on Heritage Bilinguals’ Production of Uptalk,"The present study examines the production of uptalk in Spanish and in English by Spanish heritage speakers in Southern California. Following the L2 Intonation Learning Theory, we propose that cross-linguistic influence in heritage bilinguals’ uptalk may occur along multiple dimensions of intonation. In this study, we examined the systemic dimension (i.e., presence of uptalk and presence of uptalk with IP-final deaccenting), the frequency dimension (i.e., frequency of uptalk and frequency of uptalk with IP-final deaccenting), and the realizational dimension (i.e., pitch excursion and rise duration) of heritage bilinguals’ uptalk. Our data showed that the three dimensions of intonation demonstrate varying degrees of cross-linguistic influence. The heritage bilinguals produced uptalk with IP-final deaccenting in both languages (i.e., systemic dimension), but produced it more in English than in Spanish (i.e., frequency dimension). That is, IP-final deaccenting emerges in heritage bilinguals’ uptalk in Spanish, but heritage bilinguals seem to recognize that this is an English feature that is not allowed in Spanish and try to suppress it as much as possible when producing uptalk in Spanish. However, in the realizational dimension, the heritage bilinguals demonstrated either phonetic assimilation to English (i.e., pitch excursion) or individual variability conditioned by language learning experience (i.e., rise duration). The asymmetry found across the dimensions suggests that, when bilinguals’ two languages are in competition for finite online resources, such as in the case of spontaneous speech production, phonological distinctions between L1 and L2 prosodic structures are kept, whereas phonetic differences that do not lead to any change in meaning are more prone to undergo cross-linguistic influence in order to reduce online processing cost. This study attempts to fill a gap in the literature on the cross-linguistic influence of intonation by bringing attention to heritage bilinguals. Heritage bilingualism introduces bilingual contexts that are often left unnoticed in traditional L2 acquisition scenarios (e.g., transfer from L2 to L1 intonation, asymmetry between order of acquisition and language dominance). Given that many aspects of cross-linguistic influence are shared across bilinguals, the investigation of heritage bilinguals’ intonation will contribute to building robust models of bilingual intonation.", Journal Article,10.3390/languages8010022,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/spanish-english-cross-linguistic-influence-on/docview/2791667408/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Based on the elaborate experimental design and accurate statistical analysis, the conclusion can be drawn that in the short run, explicit instruction in discourse markers can improve listening proficiency immediately in contrast with the effect of implicit instruction that is not significant, but in the long term, however, the differences between the explicit and the implicit disappear and the implicit can improve listening proficiency as well as teaching performance apparently.",,10.5539/ELLS.V4N1P48,https://doi.org/10.5539/ELLS.V4N1P48,forward

Results show that the instructed group outperformed the control group immediately after the pre-study abroad (pre-SA) instruction, as well as after the year abroad. The significant difference between the two groups, however, decreased after the period abroad as the control group also showed significant improvement without the pre-SA instruction.

Jie Huang,2014.0,Intercultural Pragmatics,"The purpose of this study is to investigate how viewers who speak different languages interpret cinematographic metaphors in a filmic advertisement. The study is organized in three parts: First, we offer a theoretical model that predicts the offline mental mechanisms that occur while people interpret filmic metaphors, based on an existingmodel of visualmetaphor processing. Second, we evaluate the model in a think-aloud retrospective task. A TV-commercial is projected individually to 30 Spanish, 30 American, and 30 Persian participants, who are then asked to verbalize their thoughts. The commercial was previously segmented, analyzed using FILMIP (Filmic Metaphor Identification Procedure), and marked for metaphoricity by two independent analysts. The collected data is then evaluated in two formal content analyses. In the first one, two independent coders classified all the clauses used by the 90 participants in relation to the steps outlined in the theoretical model. In the second analysis, those clauses in which the participants were constructing their metaphorical interpretation of the filmic advertisement were annotated for the type of metaphor they constructed. The general results show that: (1) somemental processes seem to bemore prominent in some cultures and not in others, and (2) genre-related knowledge plays a crucial role in constructing filmic metaphors in certain cultures and not in others. With this study, we theoretically formalize and empirically test the types of operations reflected in the language that viewers use to describe how they interpret filmic metaphors, thus advancing the current theory and methods on filmic metaphor interpretation from cognitive, semiotic, and cross-cultural perspectives.",,10.1080/07268602.2014.884914,https://doi.org/10.1080/07268602.2014.884914,forward

Some studies have demonstrated that SA participation is beneficial to learners’ L2 development, whereas others have not supported such a relationship. The first phase of this meta-analysis analyzed the methodological features of 66 studies, while the second synthesized 11 quantitative studies comparing L2 linguistic gains between SA and at home (AH) learners. Results from the comparisons indicate that SA learners outperform AH learners and that short-term SA is more effective than long-term SA in terms of L2 linguistic development. Along with outlining potential concerns about conducting meta-analyses on SA research, I conclude this article with suggestions for future research directions.Cette étude est une synthèse des méthodes et des résultats de travaux publiés portant sur le développement linguistique d’apprenants de langue seconde (L2) dans le contexte d’études à l’étranger.

Six pairs received pragmalinguistic support, while the others wrote their suggestions on their own. Audio-recorded pair discussions were coded qualitatively, and the written suggestions were analyzed in terms of linguistic and pragmatic characteristics. The results showed that pragmalinguistic support encouraged the participants to engage more in language-related and task-related episodes. Also, their suggestions contained more diverse lexical downgraders and conventional suggestion-giving expressions. By contrast, those who wrote suggestions without pragmalinguistic support engaged more in pragmatic-related episodes, relying extensively on epistemic modal verbs (e.g., would). The findings indicate that pragmalinguistic support may help L2 users to better attend to task content and language, producing lexically and pragmatically richer output.",,10.1515/iral-2021-0138,https://doi.org/10.1515/iral-2021-0138,forward

As the use of English for international communication increases, it is important to examine such interactions from multiple viewpoints. While previous studies have investigated various aspects of study abroad for EFL learners, the perspectives of target community members (TCMs) have often been overlooked. Therefore, this study investigated differences in EFL teacher and nonteacher TCM perceptions of five Japanese university study abroad students’ spoken pragmatic output. Students completed 10 oral discourse completion tasks before and after their one-semester study abroad. The EFL teacher and nonteacher TCM groups watched videos of and rated each task for formality and appropriateness. Findings showed the two groups perceived gains related to student speech and development. However, teachers rated on the pre-departure tasks lower but the post-tasks higher, while the TCMs did not identify as much improvement.

Methods: Fourteen undergraduate students (Ab Initio, Intermediate and Advanced Japanese level) who studied Japanese language at University of Sussex in the 2020/21 used Sail App to practice speaking Japanese with native Japanese speakers who were registered Sail App users living in Japan. Sussex students were asked to have a total of 6 speaking and listening skills evaluations by 5 Japanese native speakers who were also Helte Co Ltd staff. The 5 Japanese native speakers evaluated 14 students on 4 occasions (the initial baseline evaluation, the second month, and the third month and final evaluation). The students also self-evaluated of their listening and speaking skills on 2 occasions (the initial baseline evaluation and the final evaluation). Results: After three months, only 1 student completed all 6 evaluations and 3 students completed 4 native speakers’ evaluations by Helte Co Ltd staff. The majority of students’ speaking ability remained unchanged. However, the perception discrepancies of speaking and listening skills between Sussex students and Japanese native speakers were found. Conclusion: The majority of Ab Initio and Intermediate level students had a tendency to evaluate their listening and speaking skills higher than those by native Japanese speakers.

The participants were 50 Catalan/Spanish bilingual students (aged 12–14) from three intact classes who were learners of English as a Foreign Language and with an upper-intermediate level of proficiency. The three groups followed different approaches to teaching pragmatics: G1 was instructed in pragmatics following a task-supported approach; G2 was also instructed in pragmatics but no tasks were used; and G3 was a control group with no instruction on pragmatics and no use of tasks, either. To assess pragmatic learning, role-plays were used both before and after the pedagogical intervention. The pragmatic analysis focused on the speech acts of giving opinion, agreeing/disagreeing, interrupting, and acknowledging the interlocutor. Results showed that the two instructed groups, regardless of the type, were more pragmatically competent in the posttest in one of the pragmatic moves (i.e., interrupting). Additionally, G1 presented statistically significant differences in the posttest when acknowledging the interlocutor. Regarding the control group, no differences were found in any of the moves. These findings suggest that instruction in general, and task-supported instruction in particular, has a positive impact on the development of interlanguage pragmatics in a classroom context.",,10.1075/ap.18010.bar,https://doi.org/10.1075/ap.18010.bar,forward

This article explores some of the potential causes for the lack of implementation of pragmatics instruction in second and foreign language classrooms (Skyes, 2013) and suggests means of overcoming such challenges. Pedagogical linguistics, in the form of pedagogical pragmatics, offers insight into meeting the challenges of limited theoretical support for curricular development, lack of authentic input in teaching materials, lack of instructor knowledge, and lack of reference books and pedagogical resources for teachers. The final challenge for pedagogical linguistics and pragmatics researchers is conveying relevant research findings to teachers; means for accomplishing this are discussed in the final section of the article.",,10.1075/pl.19013.bar,https://doi.org/10.1075/pl.19013.bar,forward

Whereas debates about course content have often emphasized the importance of specificity, the presence of mixed disciplinary groups has complicated the widespread adoption of specialized teaching. We suggest that pragmatics has potential to serve as a common element because it encompasses the study of communicative action both within and outside professional communities and can thus be emphasized in any class, regardless of its degree of specificity. While pragmatic elements are fundamental to contemporary teaching approaches, we argue that these manifestations have not kept up with evolutions in interlanguage pragmatics. In order to show this, we problematize the notion of appropriateness as described in the Common European Framework of References for Languages (CEFR), comparing it with the way that the notion has been treated in contemporary interlanguage pragmatics. Finally, we provide examples of how developments in pragmatics regarding appropriateness have been integrated into both specialized and non-specialized teaching.",,10.4000/APLIUT.6813,https://doi.org/10.4000/APLIUT.6813,forward

Eighty-one learners of English at a Japanese university were divided into explicit (n = 37) and implicit (n = 44) groups for 3 hours of instruction. Written production data were collected before the interventions, immediately after them, and five months later. Learners' use of epistemic stance forms was analysed by using: (i) a measure of individual use of epistemic stance forms; and (ii) learner corpus analysis. The explicit intervention was found to be considerably more effective than the implicit intervention in both the short- and long-term for most of the targeted forms. However, in cases when learners lacked a form for a specific function before the intervention, both types of instruction appeared to be equally effective. While this research generally provides strong support for explicit instruction, the potential of implicit interventions for certain forms needs further investigation.",,10.1093/APPLIN/AMS076,https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/AMS076,ancestry

"K. Tan, Atieh Farashaiyan",2012.0,The effectiveness of teaching formulaic politeness strategies in making request to undergraduates in an ESL classroom,"It is widely acknowledged that the main thrust of second language (L2) teaching and learning is establishing and developing the communicative competence of learners. Especially, in recent years, the focus has shifted more towards intercultural communicative competence (ICC). As such, it is more practical that educational endeavors should be directed both towards the grammar or lexis of the target language as well as the appropriate use of these grammatical and lexical systems in a variety of situations by considering different social and contextual factors. Therefore, this study embarks on the effect of explicit instruction of formulaic politeness strategies among Malaysian undergraduates in making request. Sixty Malaysian undergraduates participated in the study. The students included two groups of intervention and control groups. The data were cumulated through three tests, namely open ended completion test, a listening test and an acceptability judgment test. Treatment or experimental group received explicit instruction with structured and problem-solving and input tasks. The comparison was made between the performance of treatment group and that of control in terms of the pre-test and post-test. The findings show that the treatment group outperformed significantly than the control group. This matter is suggestive that in this probe, explicit form-based instruction was successful for learners to comprehend and produce the English politeness strategies effectively in making request. The findings of this study will be beneficial for material developers and teachers to make use of form-focused strategies more effectively to teach second language pragmatic features to Malaysian students.",,10.5539/ASS.V8N15P189,https://doi.org/10.5539/ASS.V8N15P189,ancestry

Because of a lack of research on migrant doctors (rather than migrant patients) and on pragmatic aspects of doctors' communication with patients (rather than on strictly linguistic aspects), the present study investigated the pragmatic competence of doctors using an L2 in their clinical setting. By means of discourse completion tasks, L1 and L2 doctors in Belgium and Sweden were studied in terms of how they modify their interactions with patients. Discrepancies were found between the different groups of doctors. The Belgian L1 doctors used more internal modification than their L2 colleagues (syntactic and lexical modification of their main message). The Belgian L2 doctors' underrepresentation of syntactic and lexical modification is counterbalanced by a native-like pattern for external modification, whereby these doctors seem to pay particular attention to consolidation. The Swedish L1 doctors used more external modification (adding an utterance after their main message) than their L2 colleagues, but the Swedish L2 doctors used more internal, syntactic modification which can be understood as an expression of an overcompensation strategy to ensure adequate mitigation and consolidation. Pragmatically, one type of Swedish L2 underrepresentation, i.e., external modification, is counterbalanced by another type of modification, i.e., internal modification.",,10.1515/iprg.2010.005,https://doi.org/10.1515/iprg.2010.005,forward

This study investigates this issue by focusing on a learning scenario where predicate-level variability exists in the L1 input. We investigate whether Japanese learners of English can learn to invalidate event cancellation readings (Tsujimura, 2003) in English and how such knowledge develops with increasing English proficiency. We address these questions by examining how Japanese learners of English interpret accomplishment predicates that allow an event cancellation reading in Japanese but not in English. A truth-value judgment task was administered to 60 beginner, 96 intermediate, and 40 advanced Japanese learners of English as well as 20 L1 English and 20 L1 Japanese speakers. Our results showed that Japanese learners of English progressed toward a targetlike representation of aspectual entailment. We argue that such progress follows two parallel routes: a grammatical route rooted in the learners’ growing awareness of the English determiner and number morphology combined with a statistical route rooted in the learners’ inferences based on missing data.", Journal Article,10.1017/S014271641900047X,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/acquisition-aspect-l2-computation-event/docview/2342975320/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
Kamal Hasan Jawad,2021.0,Condolence in Classroom Teaching: Iraqi EFL University Students' Pragmatic Deviation,"Research studies concerning pragmatic acquisition by students have established that  pragmatic nonconformity or deviation in the execution  of speech acts, among which is ""condolence"", is primarily due to  the students' incompetence to identify the proper meaning and to handle the proper form. In Iraqi context, most Iraqi EFL university students are found to inapproriately use illocutionary acts, as they digress from the sociocultural standards and pragmalinguistic rules used for making condolence. When producing circumstances comprising the use of the expressive condolence, students' speeches and responses do not conform to those of native speakers. Their replies seem awkward or refer to certain spoken situations other than those required in the communicative process or interaction. Thus, the study intends to identify Iraqi EFL students' deviation in the performance of the expressive condolence in order to get at the reasons behind this unconventionality. To achieve this aim, fifty Iraqi EFL college students of the University of Baghdad , College of Languages, Department of English, have been chosen to give ( data) replies to a test containing five situtations involving the production of condolence. Responses to the test have shown that negative transfer of L1 socio-pragmatic knowledge and lack of pragma-linguistic rules are the main characteristics that EFL Iraqi students resort to when handling condolence. Socio-pragmatic deviation occurs because they are linguistically unconscious of the conventions and means used in the target language; therefore, their performance is a non-native one. Further, lack of syntactic and semantic knowledge is an influential factor in producing certain spoken situations of condoling.",,10.17762/PAE.V58I1.1290,https://doi.org/10.17762/PAE.V58I1.1290,forward
Kanik Mehmet,2010.0,Interlanguage pragmatics in Turkish,"This study aims to investigate interlanguage pragmatics in Turkish. For this pur-pose, a discourse completion questionnaire including four request situations was given to 33 learners of Turkish at a university in Istanbul, Turkey as well as 45 Turkish native speakers in two different programs at the same institution. The data were then coded into request strategies. The length of requests and the number of strategies employed were also coded. The request strategies were analyzed using the chi-square test while the length and the number of strategies were analyzed using the independent samples t-test. Results indicate that the two groups differed in head act strategies and downgrader strategies only in situation 3 while they differed in situation 2 through 4 in using supportive moves. In the length of the requests, number of supportive moves and the number of downgraders, the groups differed in only one situation. This shows that although differences are observed, there is no drastic difference between native-Turkish speaking students and learners of Turkish as a second language. This shows that even after one academic year in the target speech community, learners tend to choose strategies similar to the native speakers of the target language. The effect of sojourn in the target community could be further researched by comparing learners of Turkish in the target speech community to those that learn Turkish outside of the target speech community after the same amount of time spent learning Turkish..",,10.1501/dilder_0000000137,https://doi.org/10.1501/dilder_0000000137,forward
Karen Glaser,2014.0,The Neglected Combination: A Case for Explicit-Inductive Instruction in Teaching Pragmatics in ESL,"A substantial part of interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) research has contrasted ex- plicit and implicit teaching designs, generally finding that explicit approaches— those featuring metapragmatic rule provision—are more effective than their implicit counterparts, which are characterized by the absence of metapragmatic information. A second dichotomy used to characterize instructional designs, that of deductive vs. inductive approaches, has received somewhat less attention. Con- cerned with the sequencing of the instruction rather than the criterion of whether or not to provide rules, this concerns the question of whether to choose (deductive) rules or (inductive) language use as the starting point of the instruction. Although the two dichotomies are interrelated, they are often unjustifiably merged, with the labels deductive and explicit, on the one hand, and inductive and implicit, on the other, being used interchangeably. This article illustrates the reasons for this oversimplification and argues that the resulting focus on the contrast of explicit-deductive and implicit-inductive designs has led to overlooking a third possible constellation: the explicit-inductive framework. Adopting a classroom perspective, the article further attempts to point out the advantages that this neglected combination can have for the teaching and learning of pragmatics in ESL.",,10.18806/TESL.V30I7.1158,https://doi.org/10.18806/TESL.V30I7.1158,forward

This unnaturalness may be caused by not exploiting the appropriate cultural and language specific aspects in the target language. The current study focuses on a narrative characteristic of Japanese; perspective taking consistency in writing a story, and the uses of its associated structures. By examining intermediate L2 learners of Japanese whose L1 is English, this study seeks to prove whether classroom instruction helps to overcome unnaturalness caused by the inappropriate uses of perspective taking and not using its associated structures in the short- and long terms. The results of this study show that instruction helps L2 learners to maintain the consistent perspective both in the short- and longterms. However, the instruction seems to have not affected the L2 learners' utilization of a variety of perspective taking structures. Taken together, this study offers implications for earlier instruction on the learning of the narrative characteristic.", Journal Article,10.17507/jltr.1205.01,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/learning-narrative-characteristic-perspective/docview/2574809250/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Kasper, Gabriele;Wagner, Johannes",2014.0,Conversation Analysis in Applied Linguistics,"For the last decade, conversation analysis (CA) has increasingly contributed to several established fields in applied linguistics. In this article, we will discuss its methodological contributions. The article distinguishes between basic and applied CA. Basic CA is a sociological endeavor concerned with understanding fundamental issues of talk in action and of intersubjectivity in human conduct. The field has expanded its scope from the analysis of talk--often phone calls--towards an integration of language with other semiotic resources for embodied action, including space and objects. Much of this expansion has been driven by applied work. After laying out CA's standard practices of data treatment and analysis, this article takes up the role of comparison as a fundamental analytical strategy and reviews recent developments into cross-linguistic and cross-cultural directions. The remaining article focuses on applied CA, the application of basic CA's principles, methods, and findings to the study of social domains and practices that are interactionally constituted. We consider three strands--foundational, social problem oriented, and institutional applied CA--before turning to recent developments in CA research on learning and development. In conclusion, we address some emerging themes in the relationship of CA and applied linguistics, including the role of multilingualism, standard social science methods as research objects, CA's potential for direct social intervention, and increasing efforts to complement CA with quantitative analysis.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0267190514000014,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/conversation-analysis-applied-linguistics/docview/1638979480/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Speech data were collected from twenty university Japanese L2 learners in Australia, ranging from beginner to super-advanced levels, utilizing naturalistic conversation and a “spot the differences task” to elicit question sentences. The learners’ speech was transcribed and their use of yes/no questions was analyzed based on the Prominence Hypothesis. Question particles (e.g., ka? ne? deshoo?) used by the learners were also analyzed. The results indicated that the acquisition of yes/no questions in Japanese L2 generally followed the developmental stages defined by the Prominence Hypothesis. However, ‘prosody only’ (i.e., use of rising intonation), which is hypothesized as the first L2 question construction after single word questions, was not used by the L2 Japanese learners. Instead the learners used sentence-final question particles from the beginning to indicate the interrogative mood. Also, as the learners’ developmental stages progressed, they became able to utilize a wider variety of question particles. These findings are important both theoretically and practically in learning and teaching Japanese L2. This study provides empirical evidence supporting the Prominence Hypothesis in a typologically head-last, subject-object-verb (SOV) language.", Journal Article,10.18848/2327-7882/CGP/v17i02/13-34,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/acquiring-yes-no-questions-japanese-as-second/docview/2713034266/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

 The present study explores the influence of individual differences in experience, perceptual acuity, and working memory on the development of both declarative and automatized aspects of L2 phonological vocabulary knowledge. A total of 486 Japanese English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) students took part in two vocabulary tests designed to measure declarative (meaning recognition) and automatized knowledge (lexicosemantic judgement task). Their performance was tied to the quantity and quality of their EFL experience, as well as their scores in auditory processing and working memory. While several significant, modest correlations between experience, aptitude, and vocabulary outcomes were observed, certain predictor variables were uniquely associated with either declarative or automatized vocabulary performance. Specifically, individuals with more extensive, typically language-focused EFL training and greater working memory demonstrated higher levels of declarative knowledge. Conversely, those who pursued extracurricular practice outside the classroom – exposing themselves to auditory materials and/or participating in study-abroad experiences – showed a more automatic execution of vocabulary knowledge.",,10.1017/s1366728924000609,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1366728924000609,forward

 The present study revisits the differential roles of form, meaning, and use aspects of phonological vocabulary knowledge in L2 listening proficiency. A total of 126 Japanese English-as-a-foreign-language listeners completed the TOEIC Listening test, working memory and auditory processing tests, the Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire, and several tasks designed to tap into three broad aspects of phonological vocabulary knowledge: (1) the ability to access phonological forms without any orthographic cues (phonologization), (2) the ability to recognize words regardless of the talker (generalization), and (3) the ability to determine the semantic and collocational appropriateness of words in global contexts in a fast and stable manner (automatization). Whereas the perceptual, cognitive, and metacognitive variables made relatively small contributions to L2 listening proficiency (0.4%–21.3%), the vocabulary factors explained a large amount of the variance (77.6%) in the full regression model (R2 = .507). These large lexical effects uniquely derived from the three different aspects of phonological vocabulary knowledge—automatization (55.3%), phonologization (20.8%), and generalization (1.5%). The findings suggest that successful L2 listening skill acquisition draws on not only various levels of phonological form-meaning mapping (phonologization, generalization) but also the spontaneous and robust retrieval of such vocabulary knowledge in relation to surrounding words (automatization).",,10.1017/s027226312300044x,https://doi.org/10.1017/s027226312300044x,forward

 By adopting a pre- and post-test design, the current study longitudinally examined the complex relationship between two different dimensions of phonological vocabulary knowledge (declarative vs. automatized) and their ultimate impacts on global L2 listening proficiency among 133 Japanese EFL students. The declarative group focused solely on what target words sound like and mean via meaning recognition tasks. The automatization group worked not only on such form-meaning mappings but also on prompt access to the target words in a semantically, collocationally, and grammatically appropriate manner via lexicosemantic judgment tasks. Compared to the declarative group, the automatization group showed relatively robust learning in both declarative and automatized dimensions of target words. Although neither training approach showed clear superiority, the results suggest that relative gains in automatized, rather than declarative, dimensions are associated with enhanced L2 listening proficiency. The distinction between declarative and automatized dimensions of phonological vocabulary knowledge, along with the absence of a direct link between training type and improved listening proficiency, offers valuable insights for future extension studies.",,10.1017/s0142716424000468,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0142716424000468,forward

When an individual is communicatively competent, he/she can carry out an effective conversation in social situations. Therefore, pragmatic competence establishes a compelling factor in English language learning as it permits second/foreign language learners to carry out successful conversations in real-life interactions outside the classroom atmosphere. The improvement of foreign language learners’ pragmatic competence will strengthen their communicative competence. The purpose of this paper is to assess foreign language learners’ comprehension of conversational implicatures by using a multiple-choice discourse test (MCDT) and their performance in a discourse completion test (DCT). Through the use of a quantitative analysis, 54 adult learners of English at C1 and B2 levels of proficiency defined by the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) in a university in Cyprus were tested on their use of implicatures and speech acts. EFL learners were more successful in the MCDT regarding the comprehension of formulaic and idiosyncratic features but received lower results in the DCT. As well as testing the proficiency level, this study was also designed to investigate the difference between the gender performances of the DCT and MCDT. The results revealed that there is no statistical significance between the male and female respondents in terms of pragmatic competence. Based on these results, the role of teaching pragmatics in EFL classrooms portrays a major aspect for a sustainable learning environment.

Although much emphasis has been placed in Korean language learning and teaching on the importance of honorific styles, my article reveals that this at times has come at the expense of ignoring the other side of the coin: non-honorific language. Indeed, Korean language teaching materials delay the teaching of non-honorific language to intermediate level and then only deal with them in a perfunctory way. This is unfortunate as the pragmatics of non-honorific styles can be complex and learners frequently encounter these styles outside of class, even when their Korean level is rudimentary. I argue that this lack of emphasis on non-honorific language is not limited to Korean but represents a common tendency within language pedagogy to avoid language that is considered ‘casual’ or ‘impolite’. With traditional teaching materials doing a poor job at representing these facets of language use, the solution I put forward is the use of multimedia activities.

However, the EFL teacher, who is usually the chief facilitator in an EFL context, is marginalized both as a focus of research and in the development of their pragmatic skills in English. An unfair reason generally given is that adult learners have a sufficient stockpile of already acquired pragmatics knowledge in their L1, which would serve them as needed. Yet, as observed over the years this assumption is proving costly.

In this article I will draw on recent research into the demands of two different professions, childcare and medicine, to consider some of the issues faced by transnationals seeking to master not only the language but also the professional and community cultures underlying talk at work.

Lama Nassif,2021.0,Codeswitching between Modern Standard and Colloquial Arabic as L2 sociolinguistic competence,"Multidialectal use of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Colloquial Arabic (CA) has become standard practice among Arabic speakers.
 Therefore, a question facing Arabic instructors and curriculum planners is what methods to adopt to raise learners’ awareness of
 this sociolinguistic reality. Some programs introduce MSA and one variety of CA from the beginning of Arabic instruction. However,
 the question of how learners who receive multidialectal training use MSA and CA simultaneously in their speech productions and how
 their MSA–CA use evolves over their years of Arabic study remains under-researched. The current study addressed these questions by
 studying the speech productions of 51 second language (L2) Arabic learners enrolled in three years of Arabic instruction. The data
 show that the participants consistently code-switched between MSA and CA, and seemed to conform to sociocultural norms designating
 MSA as more formal and CA as more personal and intimate. As learners’ proficiency levels increased, a wider range of
 sociolinguistic functions was observed. The study reinforces the importance of L2 Arabic curricula decisions that embrace the
 multidialectal use of Arabic in the L2 Arabic classroom and asserts learners’ ability to use MSA and CA simultaneously.",,10.1075/AP.19022.NAS,https://doi.org/10.1075/AP.19022.NAS,forward

Significant differences existed at the overall level and in conducting speech acts and performing routines at the category level according to gender. Significant differences were also found in the four aspects of conducting speech acts: 1) correct speech acts, 2) typical expressions, 3) amount of speech and information, and 4) levels of formality, directness and politeness. In addition, in some individual items in understanding conversational implicature and performing routines, significant differences were found.

 Improving the teaching of invisible culture is a recognised need in the TESOL sector. While there are both scholars calling for a
 more nuanced focus in classrooms, and teachers willing to take this approach, there has yet been no systematic approach developed
 for its teaching. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between theory and pedagogical need by proposing that the Natural Semantic
 Metalanguage (NSM) is a useful tool in ELT through which resources for teachers and learners can be developed. In particular, it
 will discuss the results of a pilot study into using cultural scripts to teach cultural norms, demonstrate how they can be applied
 to classroom teaching situations, and discuss how materials can be developed from the theories.",,10.1075/ARAL.17030.SAD,https://doi.org/10.1075/ARAL.17030.SAD,forward

Efforts to address the knowledge gap of understanding of culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students within the mathematics community, specifically those focused on mathematics learning disabilities, have typically focused on strategies for specific mathematics concepts and skills such as computation, word-problem solving, or fraction strategies. As the population of CLD students who are identified both as culturally and linguistically diverse and having a specific learning disability in the area of mathematics increases, there have been increased efforts to identify strategies that support the complexity that their identities bring to mathematics instruction. Much of this work is nascent in the field, and as such, this paper provides a variety of evidence-based strategies that provide appropriate whole-class instruction and intensive interventions for CLD-MD students.",,10.3389/feduc.2023.1276423,https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2023.1276423,forward
"Lee-Ellis, Sunyoung",2011.0,THE ELICITED PRODUCTION OF KOREAN RELATIVE CLAUSES BY HERITAGE SPEAKERS,"In response to new theoretical claims and inconclusive empirical findings regarding relative clauses in East Asian languages, this study examined the factors relevant to relative clause production by Korean heritage speakers. Gap position (subject vs. object), animacy (± animate), and the topicality of head nouns (± topicalization) were manipulated as experimental variables, and factors that appear to have been confounded in previous studies (e.g., context, proficiency) were controlled for or measured. Data were collected from Korean native and heritage speakers using an elicited production task. Group results failed to show a subject advantage, but individual analysis revealed that the effect of gap position varied for speakers at different levels of Korean proficiency. Results from the topicalized lead-in condition as well as error analysis revealed two different sources related to these patterns: Traditional asymmetry (i.e., subject advantage) appears to reflect the noun phrase accessibility hierarchy effect, whereas backward asymmetry (i.e., object advantage) seems to stem from word order strategy. Proficiency scores exhibited a modest correlation with the different individual response patterns. However, an animacy effect was not observed. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of a general learning strategy, language universals based on informational prominence, the role of proficiency, and the effect of task demands.

"Leila Javdani, E.

The research was triggered by the need for EFL learners to enhance their ability to use English effectively in different social interactions. Two research instruments: a Multiword Chunk Test and a Discourse Completion Test were employed to collect data for this systematic inquiry. Major findings derived from the study highlighted the fact that Iranian advanced EFL learners with higher repertoire of multiword lexical knowledge demonstrated higher pragmatic ability and outperformed in expressing the speech act of request. On the account of findings, it is inferred that knowledge of multiword lexical items is of paramount importance for interactions in different contexts in general and expressing the politeness strategies in particular. It can be argued that insufficient and limited knowledge of multiword units could be a major hindrance to effective learning and communication, resulting in pragmatic failures in many intercultural communication situations.",,10.17507/TPLS.0604.13,https://doi.org/10.17507/TPLS.0604.13,forward
"Leila Ranta, Alisa Zavialova",2022.0,The Challenges of Conducting Research in Diverse Classrooms: Reflections on a Pragmatics Teaching Experiment,"For researchers, the typical way of determining whether a pedagogical innovation works is by conducting an experiment. In migrant settings, however, experiments are more challenging to carry out due to the diversity of the learner population. Unfortunately, how to deal with these challenges is not addressed in a practical way in research methods textbooks, which typically provide a normative view of the research process. This paper aims to draw attention to the realities of classroom research carried out in the Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC) setting. These classes consist of adult immigrants and refugees from a wide range of cultural, linguistic and educational backgrounds. We illustrate how this diversity along with other characteristics of LINC programs impact the decision-making of the researcher with respect to a pedagogical experiment focused on pragmatics. The study compared a formula-enhanced approach to teaching speech acts to the more mainstream approach aimed at raising learners’ meta-pragmatic awareness about speech act behaviour. The pre-post-delayed-post-test gains appear to favour the Formula group, but the interpretability of these results is compromised by the fact that the composition of the two classes was very different. Discussion of the limitations of this case study feeds into a broader consideration of the implications for classroom research of linguistic and cultural diversity typical of L2 educational contexts like LINC.",,10.3390/languages7030223,https://doi.org/10.3390/languages7030223,forward

Liam Wilson,2023.0,Investigating the coverage of speech acts in Hong Kong ELT textbooks,"In this investigation, speech acts targeted for instruction in ELT (English Language Teaching) textbooks commonly used in Hong Kong were examined using relational content analysis. The aim was to discover which speech acts are frequently presented or not evident, so that this information could be compared to that which has been found in prior studies in other locations. This is important because, from a pedagogical viewpoint, teachers need to ensure textbooks help students learn to use as wide a range of speech acts as possible. As textbooks also need to provide clear examples and information to help learners understand how and when to use speech acts, in this research, the presentation of the speech acts was examined to identify the pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic information. It was found that there was a tendency to include certain speech acts much more frequently than others, and that some were not included at all. There was also a general lack of clear pragmalinguistic (such as the presentation of indirect speech acts) and sociopragmatic information (such as dealing with high degrees of social distance) presented. This suggests that these factors could be given further consideration and that there are improvements that could be made to both the way that textbooks are written and selected for use. Therefore, this study contributes valuable information about the speech acts in Hong Kong ELT textbooks to and has important implications for both textbook writers and English teachers regarding the field of pragmatics.",,10.56040/lmdw2014,https://doi.org/10.56040/lmdw2014,forward

To fill this gap, a quasi-experimental research was conducted with 46 undergraduate students in a Chinese university, who were randomly assigned to two conditions: a treatment group and a comparison group. The treatment group received an eight-week explicit stance instruction, while the comparison group received curriculum-based writing instruction at the same time. Academic texts were collected both prior to and after the period of intervention. Results revealed that the treatment group outperformed the comparison group in the post-test in terms of academic writing quality and stance performance.

Unfortunately, however, second language (L2) researchers often fail to report and even more often fail to interpret reliability estimates beyond generic benchmarks for acceptability. As a means to guide interpretations of such estimates, this article meta-analyzes reliability coefficients (internal consistency, interrater, and intrarater) as reported in published L2 research. We recorded 2,244 reliability estimates in 537 individual articles along with study (e.g., sample size) and instrument features (e.g., item formats) proposed to influence reliability. We also coded for the indices employed (e.g., alpha, KR20). The coefficients were then aggregated (i.e., meta-analyzed). The three types of reliability varied, with internal consistency as the lowest: median = .82. Interrater and intrarater estimates were substantially higher (.92 and .95, respectively). Overall estimates were also found to vary according to study and instrument features such as proficiency (low = .79, intermediate = .84, advanced = .89) and target skill (e.g., writing = .88 vs. listening = .77). We use our results to inform and encourage interpretations of reliability estimates relative to the larger field as well as to the substantive and methodological features particular to individual studies and subdomains.

Interpreting Effect Sizes in L2 Research,"The calculation and use of effect sizes—such as d for mean differences and r for correlations—has increased dramatically in second language (L2) research in the last decade. Interpretations of these effects, however, have been rare and, when present, have largely defaulted to Cohen's levels of small (d = .2, r = .1), medium (.5, .3), and large (.8, .5), which were never intended as prescriptions but rather as a general guide. As Cohen himself and many others have argued, effect sizes are best understood when interpreted within a particular discipline or domain. This article seeks to promote more informed and field-specific interpretations of d and r by presenting a description of L2 effects from 346 primary studies and 91 meta-analyses (N > 604,000). Results reveal that Cohen's benchmarks generally underestimate the effects obtained in L2 research. Based on our analysis, we propose a field-specific scale for interpreting effect sizes, and we outline eight key considerations for gauging relative magnitude and practical significance in primary and secondary studies, such as theoretical maturity in the domain, the degree of experimental manipulation, and the presence of publication bias.",,10.1111/LANG.12079,https://doi.org/10.1111/LANG.12079,forward

 Pragmatic competence is an essential component in communicative competence (Bachman & Palmer, 2010; Canale, 1983). Therefore, teaching pragmatic knowledge plays an important role in a foreign language curriculum, particularly in teaching English as a ForeignLanguage (EFL). However, there exists a lack of literature about the teaching of pragmatics with little empirical research on teachers’ and learners’ perceptions in Iran. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of focus-on-form instruction (FFI) speech acts on Iranian EFL learners’ pragmatic competence. Cooperative grouping, role plays, and other pragmatically oriented tasks were used to promote the learning of the intended speech acts. To come up with conclusive and persuasive findings, 132 Iranian male and female learners, intermediate- above, served as the subjects. The Oxford Placement Test (OPT) was used to evaluate the participants’ language proficiency level. Teachers’ and students’ questionnaires about the instructions and teachers’ interview were used as the instruments in this study. Data collected by different instruments were analyzed and compared by way of a mixed method and. then was triangulated to enhance its validity and reliability. The finding of the study showed that explicitness leads to better pragmatic knowledge development than the implicit knowledge. This study showed that consciousness-raising at the metapragmatic level improved EFL learners’ pragmatic performance and variety of form-strategy use substantially; thus, it should be taken more seriously in L2 instruction and material development.",,10.21203/rs.3.rs-72116/v1,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-72116/v1,forward

 This study aims to investigate Iranian EFL teachers’ perception and instructional practices towards form-focused instruction of speech acts specifically request, apology and invitation. To this aim, through sequential explanatory mixed methods design the researchers used criterion sampling and 30 English language instructors in Islamic Azad University (IAU) of North Tehran Branch served as the subjects. To attain general perception and teaching practices of instructors towards form-focused instruction of speech acts, they were asked to answer a pragmatic questionnaire. Besides, in order to achieve an enhanced awareness concerning instructors’ perceptions and practices regarding form-focused instruction a semi-structured interview was conducted for the same 30 English language instructors. Finally, six classes were observed by the investigators through convenience sampling. Likewise, through the triangulation approach, the investigators studied and merged the required data. The statistical results of the quantitative and qualitative data analysis revealed that form-focused instruction of speech acts is mostly focused by the Iranian EFL instructors. Most of them agreed with the use of explicit strategies for instructing request, apology and invitation speech acts rather than implicit strategies. Additionally, the explicit strategies were used by most of the instructors in EFL classes.

Ahmadian,2018.0,Explicit and implicit instruction of refusal strategies: Does working memory capacity play a role?,"This study investigated the differential effects of implicit and explicit instruction of refusal strategies in English and whether and how the impacts of instruction methods interact with learners’ working memory capacity (WMC). 78 learners of English were assigned to three groups (explicit, implicit, and control). Implicit instruction was operationalized through input enhancement and provision of recast. In the explicit instruction group, participants received description and exemplification of refusal strategies and were provided with explicit corrective feedback. Prior to the treatment, all participants took WMC test, Discourse Completion Test (DCT) and completed a pragmatics comprehension questionnaire (CQ). Results revealed that explicit instruction was more effective than implicit instruction for both production and comprehension of refusals and that both implicit and explicit groups maintained the improvement in the delayed post-test administered two months later. In addition, whilst WMC scores were positively and strongly correlated with gains in the immediate and delayed post-test for both DCT and CQ in the implicit group, no meaningful relationship was found for explicit and control groups. The unique feature of this research is demonstrating that explicit instruction of refusal strategies equalizes learning opportunities for all learners with differential levels of WMC.",,10.1177/1362168818783215,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362168818783215,forward

Broadly considering various facets of pragmatics, pragmatic assessment has not been potentially brought into perspective. To address this discourse gap, this study, guided by the principles of mixed-method design, pursued three purposes: to inspect the matches and mismatches, to explore rating variations, and to assess the rater consistency between the holistic and analytic rating methods of disagreement speech acts in L2 by non-native English teachers. As a result, 12 different pragmatic situations for disagreement DCTs accompanied by EFL learners' responses to each situation were rated by 50 non-native English teachers. Initially, they were asked to rate it holistically, incorporating both ratings and providing comments. The content analysis of raters' comments indicated sixteen disagreement criteria. The descriptive statistics also revealed variations across different situations. Moreover, the teachers were asked to rate it analytically based on the assessment rubrics adopted from Ishihara and Cohen (2010). The findings of intra-class correlations implied that respondents were more consistent in analytic rating. Moreover, the results indicated that there was a convergence between the two rating methods suggesting that the raters adopted the same level of leniency and severity in rating. Overall, the results accentuated the significance of pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic aspects of language for EFL raters. Finally, the results of the present study place a premium on the importance of pragmatic assessment training as well as cultural awareness.",,10.22099/JTLS.2020.34820.2738,https://doi.org/10.22099/JTLS.2020.34820.2738,forward

This study aims to investigate native EFL teachers’ major criteria in assessing the speech act of complaint produced by Iranian EFL learners. To fulfill this end, two groups of experienced native raters, including American (n=47) and British (n=30) EFL/ESL teachers, were elected for evaluating the complaint discourse completion tests (DCTs) made from video-prompts which were answered by EFL learners before. The content analysis of raters’ comments on the EFL learners’ productions revealed eleven different criteria  including logical reasoning and comments, politeness, linguistic appropriacy, semantic formula, interlocutors’ relationship, register choice, formality, degree of intensity, cultural accommodations, degree of directness, and finally fluency and naturalness  respectively from the most to the least frequent ones. The result of the t-test and chi-square analysis proved that British and American raters differed significantly in their degree of variations and preferences of these criteria. The results further showed that EFL learners’ responses seemed unreasonable and impolite to native raters which might be due to the different cultural norms between L1 and L2 societies and consequently encourage us to be aware of the importance of teaching sociopragmatic knowledge to the EFL learners.",,10.22111/IJALS.2015.2672,https://doi.org/10.22111/IJALS.2015.2672,forward

As ILP assessment has received more attention recently, the necessity of investigation on the EFL teachers‟ rating criteria for rating various  speech  acts  has  become  important.  In  this  respect,  the  present  study  aimed  to investigate  the  native  and  non-native EFL teachers‟ rating scores and criteria  regarding  the speech  act  of  request.  To  this  end,  50  American  ESL  teachers  and  50  Iranian  EFL  teachers participated to rate the EFL learners‟ responses to video-prompted Discourse Completion Tests (DCTs)  regarding  the  speech  act  of  request.  Raters  were  supposed to rate the EFL learners‟ responses and mention their criteria for assessment. The results of the content analysis of raters‟ comments revealed nine criteria that they considered in their assessment. Moreover, the result of  the  t-test  and  chi-square analyses of raters‟ rating scores and criteria proved that there are significant differences between native and non-native EFL teachers‟ rating pattern. The results of this study also shed light on importance of sociopragmatic and pragmalinguistic features in native  and  non-native teachers‟ pragmatic rating, which can have several implications for L2 teachers, learners, and material developers. معیارهای معلمان زبان بومی و غیربومی در نمره دهی کنش کلامی درخواست : مورد معلمان انگلیسی زبان آمریکایی و ایرانی چکیده: طی چند دهه اخیر،  جنبه های  متفاوتی از دانش منظور شناختی  و تاثیر آن بر آموزش و فراگیری زبان دوم در تحقیقات متعدد مورد بررسی قرار گرفته است. با این حال، در میان تحقیقات مختلف، ارزیابی منظور شناختی بینازبانی تقریبا یک موضوع جدید محسوب می شود و بسیاری از جنبه های آن مورد بررسی قرار نگرفته است. به دلیل اهمیت زیادی که اخیرا ارزیابی منظور شناختی بینازبانی پیدا کرده است، ضرورت بررسی معیارهای سنجش معلمان انگلیسی بومی و غیربومی در نمره دهی کنش های کلامی آشکار گشته است. در این زمینه، تحقیق حاضر با هدف بررسی معیارها و نمره های داده شده توسط معلمان انگلیسی  بومی و غیربومی در ارزیابی کنش کلامی درخواست صورت پذیرفته است.  بدین منظور، 50 معلم انگلیسی زبان آمریکایی و 50 معلم انگلیسی زبان ایرانی برای ارزیابی مجموعه موقعیت آزمون تکمیل گفتمان زبان آموزان ایرانی مشارکت کردند. معلمان می بایست پاسخ های داده شده توسط زبان آموزان را نمره داده و معیار هایی که  برای ارزیابی در نظر گرفته بودند، ذکر می کردند. در نتیجه ی تحلیل محتوای نظرات معلمان،9 معیار که معلمان در ارزیابی زبان آموزان در نظر گرفته بودند مشخص شد. علاوه بر این، نتیجه ی آزمون تی و مربع خی نمرات داده شده و معیارهای ذکر شده معلمان نشان داد که تفاوت معناداری بین روش های نمره دهی معلمان بومی و غیر بومی وجود دارد. همچنین نتایج به دست آمده از این مطالعه  اهمیت ویژگی هایمنظور-جامعه شناختی و زبان-منظورشناختی را در ارزیابی منظور شناختی معلمان بومی و غیربومی مشخص کرده می تواند کاربرد گوناگونی برای معلمان زبان دوم،  دانش آموزان، و طراحان کتاب های درسی داشته باشد. کلید واژه ها: نمره دهی منظور شناختی بین زبانی، ملاک نمره دهی،  در خواست، آزمون موقعیت تکمیل گفتمان",,10.22108/ARE.2017.21326,https://doi.org/10.22108/ARE.2017.21326,forward

After creating a pool of responses to the death announcements and through careful content analysis, the utterances by native Persian speakers, EFL learners, and native English speakers were coded into seven, nine, and seven categories, with expression of affection ( n = 109, 46.38%), wishes for the deceased ( n = 34, 59.64%), and wishes for the deceased ( n = 32, 23.70%) being the most prevalent ones, correspondingly. Moreover, tests of Chi-square revealed that there was a statistically significant difference among the three groups.

Based on focus group interviews with students and teachers, we show that Danish students and teachers find it awkward to adopt the German Sie when German is the language of instruction in Denmark, typically resulting in pragmatic transfer of the Danish informal norm instead. Adopting a critical pedagogy perspective, we discuss how Sie seems to violate Danish cultural values of egalitarianism, causing cultural cognitive dissonance (CCD) in CLIL learning environments. We show that Danes cope with CCD by rejecting Sie or employing (sometimes quite complex) strategies to avoid direct address altogether. However, our investigation also reveals that CCD is partly locational/situational, and that Danes are less reluctant to use Sie in Germany or towards a native German teacher, suggesting a need to raise awareness about this issue in CLIL-courses and foreign language courses where language and intercultural training is taking place ‘at home’ and possibly with a teacher who is not a native speaker of the language. Finally, we offer some suggestions for attenuating this discomfort by rethinking the way that German polite forms of address are taught, and we make the critical point that a major premise of CLIL teaching - the idea of learning a foreign language ‘on one’s own territory – may give rise to cultural resistance, to which teachers should be alert.",,10.7577/fleks.2135,https://doi.org/10.7577/fleks.2135,forward

Nearpod is a useful cloud-based application to support self-paced learning. This paper aims to probe the effect of learning through Nearpod on EFL learners’ request performance. Researchers designed seven self-access courses to teach requests. The data was collected from 11 EFL learners through Online Oral Discourse Completion Tasks before and after the treatment. The post-test results revealed that the participants significantly improved their request performance after the treatment. The learners’ responses in the pre-test and the post-test were also qualitatively analyzed for an in-depth investigation of the changes in their requesting behavior. The findings revealed that the learners stopped modality generalization and started using a variety of modal verbs according to the context of situation after the treatment. Additionally, it was indicated that self-paced pragmatics instruction helped learners overcome the pragmatic failures regarding the main verb use in request head acts. Furthermore, the differences regarding the learners’ use of internal and external modifiers were also documented. After the treatment, they performed various internal modifiers that were either absent or uncommon in the pre-test data. Alerters and grounders were found to be the most frequent external modifiers in both the pre-test and the post-test data set. In summary, the results indicated that self-paced learning helped learners improve strategies for performing appropriate requests.",,10.7575/aiac.alls.v.12n.6.p.67,https://doi.org/10.7575/aiac.alls.v.12n.6.p.67,forward

The study found that the non-native speaker teachers (NNSTs) evidenced a developed sense of sociopragmatic knowledge in high imposition L2 requests for action, and employed politeness strategies that were indicative of a concern to maintain social and face relationships in virtual consultations. It is argued that despite their advanced English language proficiency, the teachers’ reliance on directness, excessive formality, and lengthy grounders could still put them out-of-status and render their emails as pragmatically inappropriate. The study further confirmed significant differences in how the two groups perceive appropriateness and politeness in direct and unmodified student email requests to faculty. Overall, while the NSs judged the emails primarily according to their content and, to a lesser extent, according to their form and framing devices, the NNSTs focused almost exclusively on form and framing devices (in/formality, in/directness, nature and extent of mitigation, opening/closing moves, forms of address).",,10.1515/pr-2020-0046,https://doi.org/10.1515/pr-2020-0046,forward

The findings revealed a complex picture with mixed results. Even though external modification showed some positive effects after the intervention, the study revealed no gains in relation to the overall use of internal modification as the learners’ overall use of lexical/phrasal mitigators deviated even more from NS usage after the pedagogical treatment. We argue that, in relation to the learners’ pragmalinguistic performance, the results seem to confirm the fact that surrounding factors such as the duration, quantity and quality of the pedagogical intervention play a complex role in accounting for such mixed findings. Results further showed that the way learners perceived social reality was not affected by the instructional treatment. Our findings suggest that learners’ sociopragmatic development may not be as easily amenable to teaching as pragmalinguistic development. The development of L2 sociopragmatic awareness seems to need both longer explicit pedagogical instruction and rich exposure to the target language environment.",,10.5070/L210333950,https://doi.org/10.5070/L210333950,forward

M. Gomez-Laich,2016.0,Second Language Learners' Divergence from Target Language Pragmatic Norms.,"Pragmatic competence is an indispensable aspect of language ability in order for second and foreign language (L2/FL) learners to understand and be understood in their interactions with both native and nonnative speakers of the target language. Without a proper understanding of the pragmatic rules in the target language, learners may run the risk of coming across as insensitive and rude. Several researchers (Bardovi-Harlig, 2001; Kasper & Rose, 2002) suggest that L2 pragmatics not only can be taught in the L2/FL classroom, but, more importantly, that explicit approaches that involve direct explanation of target pragmatic features are beneficial for learning pragmatics. Just as native speakers of a language acquire a “set of dispositions to act in certain ways, which generates cognitive and bodily practices in the individual” (Watts, 2003, p. 149), instructors can help learners to become aware of the pragmatic features that characterize the target language. Although the importance of explicit teaching of pragmatics is well recognized in the literature, learning norms and rules of pragmatics largely depends on learners’ subjectivity. Learners’ convergence or divergence from the L2 pragmatic norms, both consciously and out of awareness, sometimes depends on whether these norms fit their image of self and their L1 cultural identity. Since identity-related conflict can have significant consequences for the acquisition of second language pragmatics, failing to consider the centrality of learners’ identities will produce an inadequate understanding of SLA. This paper synthesizes studies that document the reasons why learners opt to remain foreign by resisting certain L2 practic-es. The following synthesis question was proposed: Why do language learners resist the pragmatic norms of the target language?",,10.14746/SSLLT.2016.6.2.4,https://doi.org/10.14746/SSLLT.2016.6.2.4,forward

As with any other large field of study, some subareas have become the focus of study, often influenced by advances and research in applied linguistics, while others remain to be explored further; among these is the area of technology-mediated second/foreign language (L2) pragmatics, also known as interlanguage pragmatics. The lack of research in this area is puzzling if one considers that pragmatic competence is one of the essential components of communicative competence and that most of the technologies today exist in the service of communication. This article reviews the efforts so far to explore the connections between interlanguage pragmatics and a variety of technologies and innovations, as well as existing resources to bring L2 pragmatic teaching into the language classroom. It then suggests unexplored areas where technology could be used to aid the development of pragmatic competence and where pragmatic theory can inform SLA research.",,10.1017/S0267190519000047,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190519000047,forward
M. González‐Lloret,2022.0,Technology-mediated tasks for the development of L2 pragmatics,"Developing pragmatic competence implies the learning of the norms and principles that affect the behavior of participants in a culture (i.e. sociopragmatics) and the ability to choose the language to realize those norms (i.e. pragmalinguistics). Learning to be pragmatically appropriate in the second language (L2) is not easy, and although it is possible without instruction, research shows that instruction helps development (Plonsky & Zhuang, 2019). This article advocates that technology-mediated tasks are an excellent and effective pedagogic tool to promote L2 pragmatic development. The article will introduce some key findings of studies that incorporate technology and pragmatics as well as those that have investigated tasks and L2 pragmatics to then focus on those studies that incorporate the three elements: tasks, technology and L2 pragmatics. These studies are grouped by their main focus of investigation: (1) the task, (2) the technology, or (3) the L2 pragmatic feature. As a whole, these studies show the possibilities that tasks and technology-mediated contexts have to engage learners in discursive practices that may not be possible otherwise, exposing them to the cyberpragmatics of an ever-growing digital world.

Two groups of freshman English majors were randomly assigned to the experimental (enhanced input) group and the control (mere exposure) group. Initially, a TOEFL test and a discourse completion test (DCT) ensured homogeneity of the groups in terms of general proficiency and pragmatic competence. Then, the participants received the instructional treatments on English politeness strategies (PSs). They read and listened to dialogues containing the intended PSs. The target PSs were in bold typeface in enhanced input group’s dialogue booklet and in regular font in mere exposure group’s booklet. Subsequently, the groups took the DCT posttest. The analysis of the pretest and posttest data revealed the following results: Iranian intermediate EFL learners differed from English native speakers in their use of PSs; there was a low relationship, an insignificant correlation (rxy = .25), between general proficiency and pragmatic competence (i.e. competence in English PSs) of Iranian intermediate EFL learners; and input enhancement had a significantly greater effect on the acquisition of English politeness strategies (both comprehension and use of PSs) than simple exposure to PSs. The study implies that EFL learners should be provided with a specific instruction on English PSs and PSs should be presented in a noticeable way (e.g. typographically enhanced).",,10.5539/ELT.V6N12P136,https://doi.org/10.5539/ELT.V6N12P136,forward
"M.

Moreover, the potential of literature as a means of introducing learners into the social practices and norms of the target culture, which underlie the pragmatic competence, has not been fully explored. This study, then, set out to investigate the possible contribution of plays , as a medium of instruction, to the pragmatic development through either explicit or implicit mode of instruction. To this end, 80 English-major university students were assigned to four experimental groups: two literary and two nonliterary groups. One of the literary groups (Implicit Play) received typographically enhanced plays containing the speech acts of apology, request, and refusal and the other (Explicit Play) received the same treatment in addition to the metapragmatic instruction on the acts. The medium of instruction for the nonliterary groups were dialogs containing the given functions; they were also given either enhanced input (Implicit Dialog) or input plus metapragmatic information (Explicit Dialog).

It was rather the mode of instruction that mattered most, where explicit groups outperformed their implicit counterparts. These findings indicate that even though implicit teaching, that is, exposure to enhanced input followed by some awareness-raising tasks, is effective in pragmatic development, it cannot contribute so much to learning as can the explicit instruction.",,10.18869/ACADPUB.IJAL.18.2.109,https://doi.org/10.18869/ACADPUB.IJAL.18.2.109,forward

The CBPI intervention consisted of six group sessions with a pre-test - instruction - post-test design. While minor inter-level differences exist, all participants in the intervention exhibited enhanced sociopragmatic capacity. Participants demonstrated a shift from rule-of-thumb-based thinking to a focus on the meaning potential of utterances.

The participants (N = 144) carried out an open role-play where requests and responses to such requests were required. A seven-point scale was used to assess grammatical competence in a different way to previous studies, which generally equate grammar with proficiency levels. The study describes the interface between the acquisition of grammar items and the development of pragmatic competence. The results show that as the learners become more grammatically competent, they tend to use more elaborate requests and responses and more pragmatically appropriate utterances. Further evidence is, therefore, provided to the parallel development of grammar and pragmatics in a context that has received little attention so far. The findings will also be discussed in relation to the EFL classroom.",,10.1515/eujal-2014-0027,https://doi.org/10.1515/eujal-2014-0027,forward

This study aimed to explore the effects of concurrent group dynamic assessment (G-DA) on Iranian EFL learners’ learning of requests and refusals, following a mixed method design. In the experimental part of the study, 2 intact classes were homogenized by a pretest, with 24 written discourse completion tasks (WDCTs), carried out by the participants as the treatment. Concurrent G-DA group received calibrated feedback, whereas the nondynamic assessment (N-DA) group was explicitly provided with pertinent assistance without considering their zone of proximal development (ZPD). Additionally, for the sake of a qualitative study, all the dialogues between the teacher and pairs of students under investigation were audiorecorded while they were receiving the treatment. Finally, a WDCT posttest was administered to both groups. Results of the analysis of the data, using t test, showed that the G-DA group performed significantly better than the N-DA group. Also, the qualitative microgenetic analysis of the dialogues between the learners and their teacher indicated the effectiveness of concurrent G-DA in learning requests and refusals, thus corroborating the efficiency of dynamic assessment (DA) in pragmatic instruction.

Furthermore, none have juxtaposed the effect of incorporating an output-based instruction with an input-based one. The study employed an experimental design over a 13 week period with 90 students randomly assigned to the one of the five groups consisting of four treatment groups and a control group. Each treatment group received one of the following kinds of instructions: (a) individual input-based, (b) collaborative input-based, (c) individual output-based, or (d) collaborative output-based. Treatment groups’ performance was compared with that of a control group on pretests and posttests consisting of a multiple choice discourse completion task and a written discourse completion task. The results indicated that there was a significant difference between pre- and posttests of the four experimental groups in both awareness and production. The results lend support to Schmidt’s (1993) noticing hypothesis and Swain’s (1985) output hypothesis and provides evidence for the success of Sharwood Smith’s (1991, 1993) input enhancement techniques.

The most common approach taken in studies on instruction is to focus on a speech act and to develop a lesson that acts as a separate unit for the learners (or study participants). The current article presents a slightly different approach, suggesting that language educators enhance grammar lessons that are already part of the curriculum with instruction on pragmatics. Instead of developing additional units, this article shows how grammar lessons can be extended and enhanced using internet searches on Google and YouTube to find authentic materials in addition to authentic written texts.

The factors were grouped into three major domains: affective, cognitive, and interpersonal. It is claimed that in each domain, proficient L2 listeners have developed strategies, that is, plans of conscious action, in order to address persistent challenges of L2 acquisition. For the affective domain, the strategies concern development of resilience in order to maintain long-term motivation and investment of identity as an active user of the L2. For the cognitive domain, the strategies involve relearning the phonological system of the L2 as an independent system in order to counteract native language influences and using compensation tactics to supplement the influences of semantic organization of one’s native language. For the interpersonal domain, the strategies involve accommodation to communication styles and a task orientation to interaction. Research is reviewed from cognitive psychology, neurolinguistics, pragmatics, bilingualism studies, and language pedagogy, with the aim of identifying particular obstacles faced by L2 listeners and practical approaches used to cope with them.",,10.1080/10904018.2014.937895,https://doi.org/10.1080/10904018.2014.937895,forward
"M. Rostamy, Kaivan Parhoodeh",2015.0,The effect of instruction on learning refusals in EFL learners,"The major aim of learning a second or foreign language is communication. In order to be a competent communicator, we must get familiar with the ingredients of speech and language. Speech acts are one of the principal elements and functional units of communication. In this realm, refusals play a key role. Due to their inherently face threatening nature, refusals are of an especially sensitive nature, and a pragmatic breakdown in this act may easily lead to unintended offence or breakdowns in communication. Refusals are also of interest due to their typically complex constructions. They are often negotiated over several terms and involve some degree of indirectness. While there are a great number of studies which examine certain speech acts, the amount of research on refusals is much more limited. The aim of this study is to investigate whether either of the instruction types, explicit vs. implicit, proves more efficient in improving pragmatic performance of Iranian EFL learners. For this reason, 45 male, military intermediate EFL learners all between19-25 years of age in a military language institute, in Tehran, Iran, were selected to participate in the study. A pretest/posttest design was adopted in this study. Having formed the three groups under investigation, (explicit, implicit and explicit-implicit) I measured all subjects’ pragmatic performance of L2 refusals through Discourse Completion Tests, DCTs. All groups were exposed to conversations from 'spectrum' English books which embody refusals. The findings proved the efficiency of explicit instruction over implicit one in increasing Iranian EFL learners' pragmatic performance.",,10.17722/JELL.V3I1.43,https://doi.org/10.17722/JELL.V3I1.43,forward

The data set comprises task-based group discussions performed by 167 young Greek Cypriot (n = 88) and Norwegian EFL learners (n = 79), aged roughly 9, 11 and 13. The findings reveal that lived experiences were spontaneously used by all age groups, most often to ground understandings of the interplay between language and context. In addition, they were employed to make generalisations about in/appropriate pragmatic behaviours and ground explorations of similarities and/or differences between L1 and L2.

Among different components of CC, a large number of L2 studies have attended to the construct pragmatic competence, which deals with both pragmalinguistic knowledge and sociopragmatic knowledge. As such, interlanguage pragmatics research is interested in the pragmatic competence and pragmatic performance of L2 learners; however, teaching pragmatics to Non-native Speakers (NNSs), especially EFL learners, is a thorny issue. As a result, pragmatic competence has been noticeably absent from ELT curricula, despite the fact that it has an assured place in different models of CC. The reasons for this neglect lie behind the obstacles to teaching and learning pragmatics in the ESL/EFL classroom settings. Thus, drawing on the published literature, this very paper primarily aims at discussing challenges and lacunas in teaching and learning pragmatics within the confines of EFL classrooms. Subsequent to this, the paper enlists suggestions to overcome these obstacles. To this end, the paper focuses on four broad areas: the EFL context, ELT materials and resources available to L2 learners in the EFL context, teacher education, and assessment of pragmatic knowledge.",,10.20535/2410-8286.108300,https://doi.org/10.20535/2410-8286.108300,forward

The performance of a treatment group was compared to the performance of a control group on pre-, post-, and follow-up tests consisting of a discourse completion test and an acceptability judgment test. The results indicated that the two treatment groups outperformed the control group, with the identical task repetition group exhibiting more statistically significant improvement in the discourse completion test (a planned written-production test) and the acceptability judgment test (a planned written-judgment test). The results implied that identical task repetition stimulates deeper perceptual and mental processing than task-type repetition in learners' recognition and production of second language (L2) request downgraders.",,10.1515/IP-2012-0004,https://doi.org/10.1515/IP-2012-0004,ancestry

Treatment group performance was compared to that of a control group on the pretests, post-tests, and delayed post-tests: an unplanned written-production test, an unplanned written-judgment test. The results showed that the CI and SI groups performed significantly better than the control group on an unplanned writtenjudgment test. There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups on the unplanned written-judgment test, which indicated that the sociopragmatics-focused instruction attracted the attention of the SI group to the sociopragmatic features of English request hedges directly, and the group perhaps then transferred their attention to the pragmalinguistic features of English request hedges. As a result, the sociopragmatics-focused activities alone had some effects on recognizing English request hedges. However, a comparison of those learners in the two experimental groups in the unplanned written-production test demonstrated an advantage for the CI group and implied that the input-based learning through not only sociopragmatics-focused activities but also pragmalinguistics-sociopragmatics connection activities contributed more to deep perceptual and mental processing of English request hedges, thereby resulting in developing more firmly established explicit knowledge.",,10.22492/IJLL.1.1.01,https://doi.org/10.22492/IJLL.1.1.01,forward

The cognitive linguistic approach consisted of applying the metaphor politeness is distance in the teaching of different degrees of politeness. It involved a spatial concept projection through which participants could understand degrees of politeness in terms of the spatially visualized concepts of near–far and high–low relationships associated with three social variables – closeness, power, and speaker difficulty – in either animated or static illustration. In contrast, the non-cognitive linguistic approach involved rote learning of target English polite requests in a list. The results demonstrated that the static version of the cognitive linguistic approach enabled participants to process degrees of politeness and perform as well as those who underwent the animated version. Moreover, the animation effects did not appear to have had a major impact on the overall performance of groups subjected to both cognitive language approaches.

Because Japanese verbs occur at the ends of clauses, this information cannot be used to predict the roles of preceding nominals. Kamide, Altmann and Haywood (2003) showed that native Japanese speakers use case markers to predict forthcoming linguistic items. In the present study, we investigated whether second language learners of Japanese demonstrate such predictive effects when processing sentences containing either the monotransitive or ditransitive constructions. A visual-world paradigm experiment showed that, although native speakers generated predictions for syntactic outcomes, the learners did not. These findings underscore the usefulness of morphosyntactic information in processing Japanese and indicate that learners fail to make full use of case markers to generate expectations regarding syntactic outcomes during online processing. Learners may rely on nonlinguistic information to compensate for this deficit in syntactic processing.", Journal Article,10.1017/S1366728914000881,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/use-case-marking-predictive-processing-second/docview/1879249496/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Furthermore, a third discourse-that of the CMC platform-also affected her discursive practices, both in terms of interaction and performance of multiple identities.

Mahmoud Ibrahim,2018.0,Explicit Versus Implicit Modes of EFL Reading Literacy Instruction: Using Phonological Awareness With Adult Arab Learners,"There is a strong belief among language teachers that intensive exposure to language alone can lead to acquisition. The present study is a qualitative- quantitative research design that used a quasi-experimental design to compare between the effectiveness of intensive exposure to language versus phonological awareness explicit instruction on adult Arab EFL learners’ EFL reading literacy in a Saudi university context. The study is also concerned with Saudi adult learners’ attitudes towards phonological awareness instruction. Participants (N=89) were all male students enrolled in an intensive EFL undergraduate program, where they were required to pass an intensive EFL course. Sample were randomly divided into a treatment group (N=47), who received phonological awareness treatment, and a control group (N=42) who were exposed to language intensively. Posttest findings confirmed the significant effect of phonological awareness instruction on the sample’s EFL literacy. Moreover, positive attitudes towards the program were detected in the interviews held at the end of treatment. Therefore, the study recommended introducing phonological awareness instruction to develop Arab learners’ EFL literacy.",,10.5539/elt.v11n9p144,https://doi.org/10.5539/elt.v11n9p144,forward

Teaching Refusals to EFL Learners of English,"To achieve communicative competence, L2 learners' need to develop their pragmatic competence and this may be fostered with the help the learners receive from their teachers. This paper is an attempt to investigate the efficacy of explicit instruction of refusal at pragmatic level to four types of acts- invitations, suggestions, offers and requests. Adopting a pretest/posttest design as with treatment and control group, the two groups in this study were exposed to the treatment. Data collected by means of written Discourse Completion Test (DCT) as well as written self report suggest that the instructional approach resulted in gain in L2 pragmatic ability of the experimental group. The delayed posttest used in the study confirmed the findings. The findings may contribute to the interlanguage pragmatic pedagogy, especially in the EFL context and suggest that meta-pragmatic information the L2 learners received through pedagogy may lead to learners' L2 pragmatic development.",,10.4304/JLTR.3.4.814-821,https://doi.org/10.4304/JLTR.3.4.814-821,ancestry

Also, L2 learners’ use of culturally specific expressions, such as proverbs, has not been adequately investigated. The present study investigated the effects of telecollaboration on L2 learners’ perceptions of their ICC knowledge and skills in relation to one type of verbal communication (proverbs) in Japanese. Nineteen L2 novice learners of Japanese were involved in the study, and they telecollaborated with 23 native speakers of Japanese using Facebook. They learned Japanese proverbs through Facebook videos introduced by their Japanese peers, followed by in-class follow up sessions and a reflection log activity, and they then performed skits in Japanese. Their perceptions of their ICC knowledge and skills were compared using the pre- and the post-questionnaires, and their language production was analyzed.

The relationship between these identity processing styles and L2 learners’ pragmatic competence is a crucial issue that has not been explored thus far in an EFL context. Therefore, the present study sought to investigate the relationship between the information-oriented, diffuse-avoidant, and normative identity processing styles as measured by Berzonsky’s (2011) Identity Processing Style Inventory (ISI-4) and L2 speech-act knowledge and production among 122 (82 F and 40 M) Iranian upper-intermediate to advanced proficiency level learners. A validated 35-item multiple-choice discourse completion test (MDCT) including five frequent English speech acts (requests, apologies, refusals, complaints, and compliments/compliment responses) and a related role-play interactive test were then employed. The application of multiple regression revealed that diffuse-avoidant and normative identity processing styles were significant but moderate contributors to both pragmatic knowledge and production; however, information-oriented identity processing style was a weak significant predictor.

In this regard, the performance of second and foreign language learners against the norms of the target language and the factors affecting them have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To contribute to this ongoing research, this study aimed to elicit pragmatic requestive features of Iranian EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners with respect to (a) request directness, (b) request perspective, (c) internal modification, and (d) external modification in eight social situations. This study also examined whether language proficiency and two contextual factors of social power and social distance affect Iranian EFL learners’ requests in English. Participants were a total of 60 university students or graduates who had taken TOEFL in the past 2 years and were thus categorized into low and high proficiency levels. A Written Discourse Completion Test (WDCT) was employed to elicit requests. To achieve the objectives of this study, both descriptive statistics and two-way ANOVA were employed. The results showed a significant main effect for contextual factors; participants’ choice of requestive features was affected by the two social factors of power and distance. Proficiency, however, did not have a significant effect on the pragmatic performance of participants. The findings of this study showed pragmatic development of participants on the one hand and some evidence of their underdeveloped pragmatic performance on the other hand, which makes explicit instruction a necessity.

"Marcella Caprario, Naoko Taguchi, R. Reppen",2022.0,Corpus-informed instruction of the pragmatic marker I mean,"ABSTRACT Pragmatic markers perform important communicative functions, but they can be difficult to learn in a second language because of their multifunctionality and lack of salience during communicative events. This study has two goals: (1) to describe the communicative functions of the pragmatic marker I mean in academic discourse; and (2) to provide instructional activities for teaching the multiple functions of the pragmatic marker I mean. Bottom-up corpus-linguistics techniques were used to discover frequent functions of I mean in a corpus of interactive classroom discourse. The results revealed three main communicative functions: (1) argumentation management, (2) communication management, and (3) interaction management (cf. Fant. 2016. Pragmatic markers in high-level second language use. In Advanced Proficiency and Exceptional Ability in Second Languages, ed. K. Hyltenstam, 15–42. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton). The results also revealed a range of subfunctions, including self-correction, elaboration, rapport building, and pause filling while holding the floor. These findings provided an empirical basis for the creation of pedagogical materials.

These challenges are examined within the framework of Relevance Theory. Research on interlanguage pragmatics of L2 Japanese is limited in scope, as studies mostly focus on speech acts and other sociolinguistic and interactional strategies. As a result, researchers have yet to formally establish how learners of Japanese have difficulties in regard to their production of meaning. This study draws on open-ended questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions to determine the pragmatic competence of L2 students across two Irish universities. The study demonstrates that learners have difficulties with processing both linguistic encoding and phenomena that involve inference. That is, learners’ inability to activate their pragmatic competence hinders their ability to produce communicative acts. Findings lend support to the need to enhance pragmatic competence among L2 learners through specific cognitive processes. This paper also contributes to the need for interlanguage pragmatics to be pursued in conjunction with current developments in Relevance Theory. It is argued that ideas developed within Relevance Theory can be particularly beneficial to the teaching and learning of pragmatic competence in the L2 classroom.", Journal Article,10.1515/ip-2023-4003,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/examining-interlanguage-pragmatics-relevance/docview/2850472506/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Maria-Pilar Safont-Jordà, Laura Portolés-Falomir",2013.0,Research Method Effects on Third Language Learners' Refusals,"Research in interlanguage pragmatics has largely ignored the multilingual background of language learners (Kasper, 2007, Safont-Jorda, in press). Although some studies have been conducted (Safont-Jorda, 2003, 2005a, b; Safont-Jorda and Alcon, in press), they have focused on the learners' requestive behavior. No studies on L3 learners' refusals have been published to date. Additionally, research methods employed in the analysis of L2 and L3 learners' pragmatic competence elicit the target pragmatic item in an artificial way, whether it be, written (i.e., Discourse Completion Test) or oral (i.e., role-play), as they provide learners with a written/oral prompt for an imaginary situation. In fact, learners provide potential answers (provided that fact tool place). Researchers have widely criticized this approach as it does not account for real communication. There are a number of situational factors influencing pragmatic and communicative development as shown by recent research (Dewaele, 2007) which are not considered if data collection is restricted to controlled pragmatic production. On that account, this paper compares refusal strategies employed in a DCT and in an instructional setting, that of the language classroom, by second and third language learners. Participants were 12 adult English learners engaged in an intermediate English course. They were Catalan-Spanish bilingual (6 subjects) and Spanish monolingual (6 subjects). As expected, results show a difference in the type of refusal strategies employed in real (i.e., classroom) and royal (i.e., oral role-play) interaction and they also point to the advantage of L3 over L2 learners in the variety of refusal strategies employed.1 IntroductionThe main aim of the present paper is to examine the effect of two variables on the pragmatic production of learners of English as a Foreign Language. On the one hand, we have taken into account the effect of the research method adopted on the use of refusal strategies. On the other, we have considered the learners' linguistic background, that is, whether they were monolingual or bilingual and thus were learning English as a second (i.e., L2) or as a third language (i.e., L3). Bearing our purpose in mind, we shall first consider those studies which have contrasted results obtained by means of an oral production task and those using ethnographic or pseudo natural data. Secondly, research on the role of bilingualism in language learners' pragmatic production will be taken into account and a particular focus will be given to the use of L3 refusals. Finally, results from our study on the effect of the research method and bilingualism in English learners' production of refusals will be described.1.1 Research methods in IL exhortative actsAccording to Clark and Bangerter (2004), three main methods have been employed in pragmatics research, namely those of intuition, observation and experiment.(...) With intuitions, you imagine examples of language used in this or that situation and ask yourself whether they are grammatical or ungrammatical, natural or unnatural, appropriate or inappropriate. This was Searle's method. With experiments, you invite people into the laboratory, induce them to produce, comprehend or judge samples of language, and measure their reactions. With observations, you note what people say or write as they go about their daily business. We will name these methods by their characteristic locations: armchair, laboratory andfield (Clark and Bangerter, 2004: 25).Interlanguage pragmatics research has adopted methods employed in LI pragmatics, and has particularly made use of 'laboratory' experiment methods. As stated by Jucker (2009), these elicitation techniques (i.e., laboratory) rely on the informants' cooperation. Participants have to imagine situations and report the way they would behave or the way they would expect others to behave in them. Some authors seek to determine the most effective method for measuring pragmatic ability (Brown and Ahn, 2011; Yamashita, 1996). …",,10.1163/9789401209717_011,https://doi.org/10.1163/9789401209717_011,ancestry

Marjorie N. Gómez,2016.0,Centrándose en Actos de Habla para Entender y Enseñar Pragmática en la Instrucción de Idiomas,"Pragmatics is considered to be an important aspect of language instruction. Today, scholars in language instruction recognize that learners must develop linguistic as well as pragmatic competence. Pragmatic competence helps learners understand, employ, and interpret language in context. However, pragmatics is regarded as one of the most strenuous aspects of language teaching and learning. Studies in pragmatics still seek to respond to the question about the teachability of targeted pragmatic features, which opens the question about whether pragmatics can be taught effectively. Can pragmatics be fully taught or must educators focus on key features of pragmatics such as speech acts, which is perhaps currently the most important established part of the subject? Certainly pragmatics and language teaching should accompany each other. However, in order to assist and assess learners in the appropriate use of language in context, language teachers today must receive some explicit instruction about pragmatics themselves. They need to be acquainted with the resources available to teach pragmatic norms. Speech acts, as part of pragmatics, can help teachers orient their instruction on developing a general awareness of how language forms are used in context. Speech acts provide a framework on which teachers can build learning opportunities for L2 pragmatic development. Speech acts can greatly support students´ development of pragmatic competence. Focusing on speech acts to teach pragmatics seems to be the answer today in language instruction; at least until new classroom research arise to help teachers find resources and materials of pragmatic features and norms.",,10.5377/FAREM.V0I16.2605,https://doi.org/10.5377/FAREM.V0I16.2605,forward

Marta Kaliska,2016.0,An Action-Oriented Approach to Language Corpora in Foreign Language Teaching,"Since the advent of communicative approach which focuses primarily on real-life communication acts, presenting new vocabulary and grammar structures within a given context or theme, language teaching has undergone a pattern shift. The methodology has acquired more interactive and sociocultural dimension involving an active attitude of learners towards their own learning process. It has developed into the actionoriented approach which views learners as social agents: members of society who have to accomplish (not only) linguistic tasks in a wider social context. According to CEFR (2001) language teaching/learning should embrace both linguistic activities and socio-cultural, pragmatic aspects of interpersonal communication where language is seen as a means to achieve non-linguistic goals. This approach implies more intensive involvement of learners who become conscious of their own needs and internal abilities, they learn by doing, by interacting with other learners (Vygotsky’s theory) and by exploring independently the sociocultural reality of a foreign language. In order to achieve such didactic goals, course syllabuses and materials need to be organized on the basis of authentic texts which reveal patterns of actual language within a sociocultural context. Language corpora can be a significant source of a real use of language, providing learners with linguistic, sociocultural and pragmatic data that allow them to analyze lexical and grammatical structures that occur in given real-life situations. Therefore, they can constitute ideal materials for designing didactic activities which can increase the motivation of learners as well. The presentation will attempt to show some action-oriented didactic solutions concerning the use of language corpora in designing teaching/learning activities conducive to more effective language acquisition.",,10.32612/UW.20804814.2016.2.PP.29-41,https://doi.org/10.32612/UW.20804814.2016.2.PP.29-41,forward

To address these gaps, the present study explored how Moroccan university professors view pragmatics and pragmatic teaching. It also explored how they use their pragmatic knowledge in the classroom. A total of 10 university professors (6 males and 4 females) from two public universities (Moulay Ismail and Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah) in Morocco participated in the current study. Quantitative data were collected by completing an anonymous questionnaire, while qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Participants expressed their perceptions and described experiences of the importance of teaching pragmatics, issues related to culture and identity in teaching English as a Foreign Language, and materials and tasks in teaching pragmatics. The findings yielded that linguistic knowledge is as essential as pragmatic knowledge. Thus, striking a balance between pragmatic and grammatical competence and teaching them simultaneously is crucial. Learners with advanced grammatical knowledge may fail to use the target language appropriately. As such, the results indicated that some teachers are unaware of the importance of introducing pragmatics to students in the early stages of learning English. Their skills are enough to be good at transmitting cultural knowledge and suitable language competence to students.

Recent trends indicate a rise in the frequency of short-term study abroad programs (less than 3 months, Allen, 2010), although research has shown that learners may need closer to 9 months to approximate native-like norms without instruction (FELIX-BRASDEFER, 2004). This raises the question of how much pragmatic development can be seen in short-term programs, and how to maximize this development. The current study analyzed the development of two expressive speech acts, compliments and apologies, in students who completed a five-week study abroad program in Merida, Mexico. During the program, learners received instruction on compliments, but not apologies. Speech act data was collected via a 24-item oral discourse completion task administered at both the beginning and end of the program and was further analyzed in SPSS. Results indicate that only some learners developed their production of apologies, while almost all learners showed development in their production of compliments, operationalized by an increased repertoire of strategies available. These results suggest the need for pragmatic instruction during short-term study abroad, and question the utility of native-speaker norms to measure pragmatic development during short-term programs.",,10.15448/1984-4301.2019.4.33989,https://doi.org/10.15448/1984-4301.2019.4.33989,forward

Status of pragmatics was analyzed in terms of the amount of pragmatic knowledge EFL leaners believed to have and the amount of pragmatic knowledge they believed to receive from teachers, classmates, course books, and exams. Additionally, attempts were made to find out whether or not there is a significant difference between male and female EFL learners in terms of pragmatic awareness. Results showed that Iranian EFL learners were aware of the importance of pragmatics and attributed a high level of pragmatic awareness to their teachers, but believed that they did not receive enough pragmatic knowledge from their teachers. The frequent method used by their teachers to teach pragmatics was error correction. Besides, learners believed that their classmates did not care enough about pragmatics, and course book and exams, from their point of view, did not cover enough pragmatic information. Gender played a significant role in pragmatic awareness of Iranian EFL learners.",,10.5539/ELT.V8N4P67,https://doi.org/10.5539/ELT.V8N4P67,forward

Accordingly, the present study aimed at investigating the influence of contrastive lexical approach (CLA), in comparison with explicit and implicit approaches, on Iranian EFL learners’ pragmatic competence. Sixty-three participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and received dissimilar instructional treatments for ten 30-minute sessions. A pretest-posttest equivalent-groups research design was carried out and pretest scores were used as the covariate in a one-way ANCOVA data analysis. CLA showed no significant advantage over the other two methods. Previous studies have often combined a contrastive method with explicit teaching. Confounding variables in this way may have made interpretation of results problematic. In the present research explicit and contrastive instructions were kept separate and no significant difference was found between the three treatments, although all instruction types enhanced the language learners’ pragmatic competence. As a result, a pragmatic teaching course is recommended which incorporates the useful teaching techniques and practices of these three approaches to teaching pragmatic competence.",,10.1515/IRAL-2016-0018,https://doi.org/10.1515/IRAL-2016-0018,forward

Thus, the present study aimed to investigate Iranian EFL Instructors' perception and instructional practices towards form-focused instruction of speech acts, specifically request apology and invitation. To this aim, through a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design, the present researchers selected 30 English language instructors in Islamic Azad University (IAU) of North Tehran Branch based on criterion sampling as the study participants. All the participants completed an adapted version of Pragmatic Knowledge Questionnaire (PKQ), and were successively interviewed in terms of their claimed perceptions and practices regarding form-focused instruction of speech acts through a semi-structured interview. Finally, six classes were observed by the researchers to get informed of their real classroom practices. The results of data analyses were then triangulated, and the findings revealed that Iranian EFL instructors used explicit strategies rather than implicit strategies to instruct speech acts in their classes. Also, they presumed and agreed that explicit instruction is more effective since this technique seems to be easier, understandable and without ambiguity for the learners.

"Michael Haugh, W. Chang",2015.0,Understanding im/politeness across cultures: an interactional approach to raising sociopragmatic awareness,"Abstract Politeness is an important aspect of communication, particularly across cultures where misunderstandings can have very negative relational consequences. Yet while various approaches to politeness in the context of second language learning have been developed, such approaches have either been largely atheoretical in their conceptualisation of politeness or have employed models that do not adequately capture participant understandings of politeness across cultures. In this paper, it is argued that an approach encompassing participant understandings of politeness is a more appropriate starting point for raising sociopragmatic awareness about im/politeness across languages and cultures. An interactional approach whereby raising pragmalinguistic awareness about the interactional achievement of particular meanings and actions in interaction is combined with raising sociopragmatic awareness about what underlies evaluations of those meanings and actions as im/polite is advocated. It is argued that raising sociopragmatic awareness in this way provides learners with the means to analyse differences between the politeness systems of their first and second languages, thereby allowing them to make more informed choices in regards to both constituting their L2 identities as well as their relationships with others.",,10.1515/iral-2015-0018,https://doi.org/10.1515/iral-2015-0018,forward

According to Taguchi (2005), these implicatures differ in the degrees of conventionality involved in producing them, hence requiring different degrees of processing effort on the learner’s part. Our second aim, therefore, is to examine which implicature type is more teachable. Two upper-intermediate classes of EFL learners were randomly assigned to the control and treatment conditions. The treatment group received meta-pragmatic instruction on the target implicatures and inferencing strategies while the control group followed a regular syllabus. The learning outcomes were measured by means of two parallel pragmatic listening tests before and after the study. An interview with eight learners was also conducted at the end of the study to examine the learners’ use of inferencing strategies. Results of the pragmatic listening tests suggested that while learners improved their comprehension of both types of implicatures, instruction produced a larger effect on indirect refusals. Findings from the interview also revealed more effective use of inferencing strategies by the learners after the treatment.

An Analysis of Referential Choice among Japanese–English Bilingual Children,"This study aims to examine whether a crosslinguistic influence (CLI) is exerted on the referring expressions of the spoken narratives of Japanese–English bilingual children in different discourse contexts. Thirteen early bilingual (school-age) children separately presented Japanese and English narratives for a wordless picture book and a speechless video clip. Further, seven Japanese and nine English monolingual children participated as controls. The linguistic devices that the children adopted to introduce, reintroduce, and maintain the topic were compared with those of their monolingual controls to detect any CLI. As predicted, CLI for English on Japanese was observed but not vice versa. In Japanese, bilinguals utilize significantly more noun phrases (NPs) compared with their monolingual counterparts. More crucially, this was observed only in the referent reintroduction context, indicating that only discourse contexts that require the integration of much pragmatic information may be vulnerable to English influence. Null forms are barely utilized in English narratives; thus, no influence from Japanese was observed. We present the referential choice patterns in the elicited spoken narratives of bilingual school-age children acquiring an under-researched language pair. By controlling for the discourse context, we demonstrate that CLI is more likely to manifest in the reintroduction context. These findings offer additional evidence for the interface and structural overlap hypothesis, further highlighting the criticality of considering information structure as an influencing condition.", Journal Article,10.3390/languages9040120,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/is-referent-reintroduction-more-vulnerable/docview/3046935305/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
Misty So-Sum Wai-Cook,2012.0,Study Abroad and Its Effect on the Pragmatic Performance of English Requests by Hong Kong English Language Students,"This thesis investigates the study abroad experience and its effect on the pragmatic development of second language learners. The research first describes affective and environmental dimensions of the study abroad experience as undertaken by a group of Hong Kong learners over a nine-month period of study at an Australian university. Second, it investigates changes in the way these learners performed requests in English over the duration of the study abroad experience. This data provides insights into their pragmatic development in English. Comparisons of request devices were made with a matched group of learners who continued their studies in Hong Kong and with a group of Australian native speakers. Finally the research examines the relationship between affective and environmental dimensions of the study abroad experience and changes in the performance of requests across the nine month study abroad period by the learners. This research takes a quantitative and qualitative approach to data analysis. A quantitative approach, using inferential statistics (ANOVA) was used to analyse learner self-report data gathered before and during the study abroad period using the Language Contact Profile. This data included information on time spent interacting or listening in English, attitudes and reasons for learning English, perceptions of the target language community, perceptions of Australia, self-rated proficiency and self-rated confidence scores. Similarly, inferential statistics (ANOVA and chi-square tests) were used to analyse and compare request performances obtained through oral Enhanced Discourse Completion Tests (EDCTs) and role-plays by three groups: the study abroad learners; an equivalent group of students in Hong Kong; and by a group of Australian native speakers. Finally, Spearman’s rho correlation was used to analyse the relationship between study abroad learners’ pragmatic performance and the affective and environmental dimensions of their experience. Qualitative data in the form of interview data and student entries in introspective diaries was collected to provide in-depth explanations for responses to the oral EDCTs and role-plays. Three main findings emerged from this study. The first finding relates to the environmental and affective dimensions of learners’ study abroad experience. Analyses revealed that, unsurprisingly, there was an overall increase in the number of hours study abroad learners listened and interacted face-to-face in English. Nevertheless, this increase plateaued after the first four months of learners’ sojourn in Australia and their interactions were mostly with other English learners who were their classmates, flat mates or friends through the Hong Kong Association at the university. These findings suggest learners established their network of friends in the first months of their sojourn in Australia, and it was unlikely learners went beyond this circle of friends during their stay in Australia. Thus, learners’ contact with fluent/native English speakers was limited. Additionally, and contrary to the common belief that there is a ‘homestay advantage’, learners living with a host family did not necessarily have more face-to-face interaction with fluent/native English speakers than those living in a student dormitory. Interaction between the host and the learner depended heavily on the individual learner’s attitude towards the host family. Furthermore, learners’ English input and face-to-face interaction correlated significantly with the increase in learners’ self-perceived confidence in speaking, communication and grammar, but not self-perceived proficiency. The second main finding concerns the pragmatic performance of English requests by at-home and study abroad learners, focusing specifically on three features of requests: request heads, softeners and external modifications. Results showed no change in the occurrence of these three features in requests made by the at-home learners at the beginning of the data collection period and again four months later. Similarly there was no change in the type of request heads and softeners used by the study abroad learners by the end of ninth months study in Australia. However, they had begun to use some of the request external modifiers that were frequently employed by native speakers of Australian English and used significantly more request external modifiers. These results lend support to the Complexification Hypothesis (Trosborg 1995) because learners first used the more routinised features before developing proficiency in the non-formulaic features of request external modifiers. More importantly, this study offered further support for the Bulge Theory (Wolfson 1986). The results in this study indicated that after nine months of being in Australia, the learners used a less familiar structure ‘conventional indirect request’ in close distance situations, such as with friends. However, in maximum social distance interactions between higher and lower status interlocutors, the learners employed direct requests to reduce cognitive burden to free more processing capacity for using external modifiers to express politeness. The third main finding relates to the effect of environmental and affective factors on the study abroad learners’ performance of English request devices. This study showed the number of request external modifiers study abroad learners used significantly increased with time. Furthermore, the results showed that by the end of the nine months, the number of request external modifiers study abroad learners used correlated significantly with a number of environmental and affective factors: learners’ overall English input, learners’ face-to-face interaction with English speakers in the living environment, as well as learners’ self-perceived proficiency and self-perceived confidence in speaking and communication, but not with their self-perceived proficiency in grammar. Overall, the research shows that learners can improve their pragmatic performance through exposure to English in the target language community in ways that are not seen in the language development of learners learning in an English as a foreign language setting. However, the results also show that study abroad learners may have quite limited opportunities to interact with English speakers during their sojourn abroad.",,10.26686/wgtn.17000731.v1,https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17000731.v1,forward
"Mohammad Baqerzadeh Hosseini, Hossein Pourghasemian",2019.0,Comparing the effects of explicit and implicit teaching using literary and nonliterary materials on learner’s pragmatic comprehension and production,"Abstract The present paper explored how plays could contribute to pragmatic development when employed as a medium of implicit or explicit instruction. 80 undergraduate English-major students were divided into four experimental groups two of which were literary and two nonliterary. Implicit Literary, as one of the literary groups was exposed to typographically enhanced plays containing the speech acts of, refusal, apology, and request. Explicit Literary, the other literary group received the same speech acts and metapragmatic instructions on the acts as well. For the nonliterary groups, dialogs which contained the given functions served as the medium of instruction for either Implicit Nonliterary containing enhanced input or Explicit Nonliterary having input plus metapragmatic information. All participants took a Multiple- Choice Discourse Completion Test (MDCT) and a Written Discourse Completion Test (WDCT) both before and after the instruction. Analysis of the participants’ performance on the pretest and posttest WDCT did not reveal any significant difference between the literary and nonliterary groups. Concerning the mode of instruction, explicit groups outperformed the implicit ones. Pre and posttest analyses of the participants’ performance on the MDCT revealed no significant differences among the groups in terms of the four teaching conditions implying that EFL learners’ knowledge of speech acts can be boosted by pragmatic instruction irrespective of the medium or mode of instruction.",,10.1080/2331186x.2019.1662979,https://doi.org/10.1080/2331186x.2019.1662979,forward
"Mohammed Bouknify, Khadija Anasse",2024.0,The Representation of Pragmatic Knowledge in Moroccan High School English Language Teaching (ELT) Textbooks,"Studies in the domain of English language teaching reveal a significant disparity between pragmatic findings and the approaches employed in English language instruction (Ishihara & Cohen, 2010). Investigations into the effectiveness of textbooks for teaching communicative skills, mirroring real-life conversations, show that English Language Teaching (ELT) textbooks often lack clear and thorough explanations of English conversational dynamics (Berry, 2000; Burns, 1998; Cane, 1998; Grant & Starks, 2001). According to the available literature on EFL/ESL textbooks, speech acts, and other pragmatic elements are largely neglected in both quality and quantity (e.g., Vellenga, 2004; Salazar Campillo, 2007; Neddar, 2010). Therefore, this study examines how textbooks cultivate pragmatic competence and evaluates the pragmatic content in EFL textbooks used in Moroccan high schools from 2006-2007. It aims to assess the depth and quality of pragmatic information covered in these textbooks. In addition to concentrating on metapragmatic details, the study discusses register, illocutionary force, politeness, appropriateness, and usage, as well as how textbook authors present speech acts. However, the study findings reveal that the selected textbooks provide insufficient pragmatic information. This underscores the necessity of supplementing EFL textbooks with more authentic materials and ample meta-pragmatic information. It is also essential to consider pragmatics during the textbook design process and enhance teachers' abilities to incorporate them into their classrooms.",,10.32996/ijahs.2024.4.2.1,https://doi.org/10.32996/ijahs.2024.4.2.1,forward
"Mohammed Nahar Al-Ali, Salsabeel M. Shatat",2022.0,Mitigating requesting acts by deaf Jordanian adults,"
The purpose of this study is to investigate the linguistic mitigating devices that deaf Jordanian adults use when making requests. To this end, a sample of 52 people (of whom 26 were hearing and 26 were deaf) was collected through a Discourse Completion Task (DCT). It was found that the two groups of participants showed variations in the way they structured their request acts and spelled them out. This was evident in the deaf group’s obvious underuse of certain request mitigation strategies and the lexico-grammatical items mapping them; in the absence of some strategies (i.e., sweetener, promise of reward, hint, and threat); and in the underassessment of social distance, relative power, and degree of imposition. This inappropriate use of requesting acts by deaf participants is attributed to their inadequate linguistic, pragma-linguistic and socio-pragmatic competence. The study concludes with some suggestions how to improve the Jordanian educational system for the deaf.",,10.1075/ps.20016.nah,https://doi.org/10.1075/ps.20016.nah,forward

Eighty ESL learners’ discourse appropriacy was measured using three pragmatically-oriented task types (complaint, refusal, and advice) across four different proficiency levels. The findings showed that, for all task types, as general proficiency increased, ratings of discourse appropriacy also increased. We found that there was a pronounced difference in discourse appropriacy between the intermediate and advanced proficiency levels, and that for learners at higher levels of proficiency, discourse appropriacy did not vary from task to task. In contrast, task type made a difference for less proficient learners in that the refusal task was particularly challenging compared with other tasks.",,10.1075/TBLT.10.10EKI,https://doi.org/10.1075/TBLT.10.10EKI,forward

"Mootoosamy, Khomeshwaree;Aryadoust, Vahid",2024.0,Transitioning from Communicative Competence to Multimodal and Intercultural Competencies: A Systematic Review,"The formulation of the construct of communicative competence (CC) was the consequence of the perceived “inappropriateness” of the theory of linguistic competence and performance. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of second language (L2) CC, a systematic review of 85 studies was conducted to assess how empirical studies have defined and operationalized the construct in the context of L2 learning and assessment. Four main themes emerged from the papers: (1) beliefs and perceptions about CC, (2) expansion of CC, (3) mixed specifications of CC, and (4) tests and measures of CC and communicative language ability (CLA). The analysis of these themes foregrounded several significant findings. First, the construct of L2 CC was significantly more prevalent in the body of research compared to L2 CLA. Second, CC has been perceived as a multifarious construct that has been researched from varied perspectives. It was found that older studies were more consistent with traditional approaches to defining CC and CLA, while the construct shifted focus to technology and self-appraisals in more recent studies. Third, there is no consensus amongst the reviewed studies about tests and methods of operationalization of CC, suggesting that the evidence provided is sample-specific and non-replicable. Importantly, it was found that over the years, CC has undergone a gradual evolution. With the multimodal and intercultural turn, CC has branched into new concepts namely intercultural and multimodal communicative competencies. Pertaining to these concepts, new notions such as telecollaboration, digital literacies, and multiliteracies have emerged. CC has also been, for long, analogous to performance, proficiency, social rules of language use, rules of appropriateness, willingness to communicate, self-perceptions of CC, and the goal of being a native speaker, which can add to the confusion surrounding the construct. The implications of the present research synthesis are two-fold. It becomes imperative to adapt world language classrooms to the rising trend in intercultural and multimodal communicative competencies. In addition, further replicable investigations should focus on developing optimal methods of operationalization that are in line with the new contemporary theoretical frameworks of language in the age of digital technologies and artificial intelligence.", Journal Article,10.3390/soc14070115,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/transitioning-communicative-competence-multimodal/docview/3085021521/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Mostafa Morady Moghaddam,2024.0,Troubles talk and complaints in teacher-student interactions,"
 Expressions of dissatisfaction are made either through troubles talk or complaints (Haugh, 2016). Against this backdrop, through the analysis of naturally occurring data in classroom interactions, this paper explores Iranian university students’ troubles talk and complaints, and how teachers reacted to them. The study’s findings reveal that female students generated more cases of troubles talk, whereas male students complained more in their interactions with teachers. In reaction to troubles talk, female teachers’ affiliative responses drastically outnumbered male ones, whereas in reaction to complaints, male teachers’ disaffiliative responses largely outnumbered female ones. The conclusion is that gender differences and the appraisal of the expression of dissatisfaction as troubles talk or a complaint play a pivotal role in teachers’ responses. In this study’s institutional context, complaints were not welcomed by the teachers, in that they linked students’ expressions of dissatisfaction to low self-efficacy or subjective judgment of teachers’ performance. This study highlights the importance of local contexts and practices in understanding the nature of complicated speech acts such as complaints.",,10.1163/18773109-01602004,https://doi.org/10.1163/18773109-01602004,forward

In the study we report on, data from 180 Iranian EFL students were collected (90 boys vs. 90 girls), and the Pearson-Product Moment Correlation Coefficient used to test whether and to what degree the macro and micro components of Prutting and Kirchner’s (1987) Pragmatic Protocol correlate with learners’ scores on the speaking component of the IELTS General Training Test, and whether any perceived relationship varies according to gender. Results indicated that the verbal and paralinguistic components of the Protocol correlated significantly with the different tasks that feature in the IELTS speaking test. This, we argue, has implications for language teaching, and in particular stresses the need to foster conditions that allow for the development in learners of a more fine-tuned understanding of the relationship between language and context and the ways in which particular components of pragmatic competence are called upon in the performance of different kinds of communicative tasks.",,10.30827/portalin.vi33.26643,https://doi.org/10.30827/portalin.vi33.26643,forward

Considerable viewpoints were obtained by analyzing the data collected from 104 Indonesian EFL teachers using questionnaires and focus group interviews. While still maintaining the conventional way of teaching English, these teachers admitted the importance of socializing English pragmatics to their students. They indicated that EFL learners needed to learn the socio-cultural norms of the target language in order to communicate appropriately. Teachers viewed politeness essential for learners to understand that failure to meet the required action might break interpersonal relationships. Therefore, they agreed that language classrooms should utilize interactive strategic tasks that involved learner-learner and teacher-learner interactions to foster the presence of pragmatic socialization in the classrooms. Even though most teachers were unsure about how they would put their ideas in practice, it was evident that teachers perceived both explicit and implicit language socialization processes promising and worth implementing.

More specifically, it explored how MLs’ interlanguage requests converged or diverged from English Natives’ (ENs) requests in the use of strategy types and (in) directness.  First, a contrastive pragmatic analysis of requests by Moroccan natives (MNs) and ENs is deemed necessary to provide native baseline data and establish MNs’ and ENs’ pragmatic norms of request performance. Second, an interlanguage request analysis is conducted to reveal the pragmatic features of MLs’ requests. The three sets of data for this study were collected via an open questionnaire as it serves the purpose of this investigation. The results revealed that MLs deviated from the ENs’ pragmatic norms of (in) directness, mostly by falling back on their native pragmatic norms, which bears testimony to pragmatic transfer. Requests do not seem to be conceived of in the same way by MNs and ENs, and MLs transferred their native request conception when performing in English. MLs used more direct strategies. The study predicts instances of cross-cultural misunderstanding and pragmatic failure in intercultural encounters between MLs and ENs, which is likely to cause undesirable cross-cultural clichés and stereotypes. The paper suggests some pedagogical implications to alleviate this problem among MLs.

"Myrto Grigoroglou, A. Papafragou",2017.0,Acquisition of Pragmatics,"How do children learn to bridge the gap between the literal, semantic meaning of words and the intended, pragmatic meaning of an utterance? The acquisition of pragmatics is the topic of an experimental field of study that investigates this question. According to an influential pragmatic theory proposed by the philosopher Paul Grice, communication is a collaborative effort governed by specific rules (or “maxims”). A collaborative speaker is expected to be as informative as required by the purpose of the communicative exchange (maxim of Quantity), truthful (maxim of Quality), relevant (maxim of Relation), and unambiguous (maxim of Manner). A collaborative listener makes inferences about the speaker’s intentions based on the assumption that the speaker is being cooperative and following the conversational rules. Later pragmatic theories such as Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson’s relevance theory have offered important alternatives to the Gricean framework but share several foundational assumptions with Grice’s approach, including the idea that human communication involves representing the speaker’s beliefs and goals. Whether young children are capable of making such inferences about the speaker’s mental states and how aspects of this ability might develop are the most important questions in the study of children’s pragmatic development. For many years, it was believed that children before the age of five or six were not able to entertain pragmatic inferences about the speaker’s intentions or knowledge state. However, more recent theoretical advancements in the semantics-pragmatics interface and the development of new methodological tools have led to a reconsideration of older findings. It appears increasingly likely that the skills required for pragmatic reasoning are in place from a very young age, but the process of applying those skills in communication is effortful and highly task dependent, and continues to develop until late childhood. This article focuses on prominent work on the acquisition of children’s pragmatic abilities in three areas that have generated a considerable body of data: Reference, Implicature, and Figurative Language.",,10.1093/ACREFORE/9780199384655.013.217,https://doi.org/10.1093/ACREFORE/9780199384655.013.217,forward

The flipped classroom model is a recently developed teaching method that constitutes a role change for teachers and learners, inverting the front-of-class instruction paradigm in favor of active and collaborative classroom learning. To potentially take advantage of this promising trend, the present study seeks to explore the effectiveness of the flipped classroom for developing Saudi EFL undergraduates’ pragmatic competence and language proficiency by focusing on the comprehension of conversational implicatures during one academic semester. A total of 100 students, assigned to flipped teaching group (n=50) and traditional teaching group (n=50), participated in the study. To elicit the required data, the Oxford Placement Test, a discourse completion test, and reflective e-portfolios were used. A post-test revealed that pragmatic competence significantly increased in the case of the flipped group. The mean score of the flipped group (M=18.48) was considerably higher than that of the traditional group (M=14.68). In following the flipped model of instruction, this progress was influenced by effective out-of-class preparation and appropriate manipulation of in-class time.",,10.5539/ijel.v10n2p107,https://doi.org/10.5539/ijel.v10n2p107,forward

Although the instruction took place in an English as a foreign language (EFL) context, the same dialogic approach is relevant to ESL in Canada and elsewhere, as picture books enrich narratives, visually mediating the context of language use in a manner comprehensible and captivating to young learners. The learners’ pragmatic development was scaffolded dialogically through instructional materials doubling as teacher-based assessments, including formality judgment tasks, discourse completion tasks, and student-generated visual discourse completion tasks, assessed through predesigned rubrics and written reflections by the teacher. Video-recorded data showed that repeated visual assistance provided by the teacher and peers led to enhanced pragmatic awareness and metapragmatic judgments of the relative levels of formality and politeness of the target pragmatic formulas. However, with little L2 exposure, these learners were often unable to produce newly introduced expressions and failed to match the demands of the context with appropriate language choices during this isolated series of instructional events.",,10.18806/TESL.V30I7.1157,https://doi.org/10.18806/TESL.V30I7.1157,forward

However, the ways of expressing congratulation may vary because the expressive speech act “congratulations” is not the only way to express happiness and share others their happy news. The present study investigates the congratulation strategies of Pakistani English as second language (ESL) learners and British English speakers under the influence of social distance variable. A quantitative approach is applied in the analysis with the frequency of strategies (semantic formulas) being numerically analyzed. The current study recruited 120 participants, and who were further divided into four different groups: 30 British English speakers, 30 Pakistani ESL learners in the elite class, 30 Pakistani ESL learners of the middle class, and 30 Pakistani ESL learners in the lower class. For data collection, a discourse completion test (DCT) was used as a tool. The findings reveal that the most frequently used types of congratulation strategy are illocutionary force indicating device (IFID) followed by overlapped strategies (a combination of two), an offer of a good wish, expression of happiness, request for information, encouragement, expression of surprise, and suggestion of celebration , while other types of strategies are not used by the participants. The study reveals the existence of crosscultural differences in the use of congratulations by Pakistani ESL learners. The findings further show how the middle and lower class of Pakistani ESL learners use a more elaborated form of compliment responses (CRs) as compared to Pakistani ESL learners of elite and British English speakers. The findings may help in understanding the pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic aspects of Pakistani ESL learners as compared to British English speakers.",,10.21203/RS.3.RS-708164/V1,https://doi.org/10.21203/RS.3.RS-708164/V1,forward

Nan Huang,2022.0,Revisiting L2 pragmatic competence through implicit vs. explicit instructional framework,"Successful interaction in the target language requires L2 learners to use and understand the grammatically correct language. At the same time, the language used is expected to produce socioculturally appropriate utterances that it refers to their Pragmatic competence. The latter entails acquiring pragmatic competence, which has proved to be very challenging for L2 learners. This is because they gain limited exposure to the use of language for real communication in an authentic social setting. Moreover, instruction has been found to influence the functional abilities in L2 as it equips the learners with the ability to produce and comprehend L2 in different situations. Focusing on the research conducted on the role of explicit and implicit instruction on L2 pragmatic competence, this study aimed to give a summative description of the empirical studies carried out on teaching pragmatics. The investigation ends up with a conclusion, instructional implications, and suggestions for future research.",,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.987729,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.987729,forward
Nancy Bell,2011.0,Humor Scholarship and TESOL: Applying Findings and Establishing a Research Agenda.,"Washington State UniversityPullman, Washington, United StatesResearch in the areas of second language (L2) pragmatics and ofconversational humor has increased in recent decades, resulting in astrong base of knowledge from which applied linguists can drawinformation for teaching purposes and undertake future research. Yet,whereas empirical findings in L2 pragmatics are beginning to find theirway into textbooks, recommendations and activities, intended tointegrate humor into the L2 classroom with the goal of increasinglearners’ proficiency in the use and understanding of L2 humor,remain based on intuition alone. Despite parallel developments in L2pragmatics and humor studies, the two areas of scholarship have largelyignored each other, with humor scholars focusing mainly on nativelanguage uses of humor, and applied linguists avoiding the study ofhumor by L2 users. The purpose of this paper is to bring these twofields together by outlining some major linguistic and sociolinguisticfindings of humor scholarship, discussing how these understandingsmight help us integrate humor into the L2 classroom in a principledmanner, and suggesting directions for future research on humor andL2 learners.doi: 10.5054/tq.2010.240857",,10.5054/TQ.2011.240857,https://doi.org/10.5054/TQ.2011.240857,forward
"Nancy Bell, S. Attardo",2010.0,Failed humor: Issues in non-native speakers' appreciation and understanding of humor,"Abstract What is it that makes humor difficult to understand and appreciate in a second language (L2)? Despite advances in research in both L2 pragmatics and humor studies, scholars have as yet had little to say on this topic. In interviews, learners themselves pinpoint culture, vocabulary, and the speed at which playful talk often takes place as difficulties. Yet, as we know, hypothetical self-reports of language use can be quite unreliable. Thus, this exploratory study aimed to examine L2 understanding of humor more systematically. Six advanced non-native speakers (NNSs) of English kept diaries in which they recorded their experiences with humor in English over an eight-week period. Group meetings were also held every two weeks during this time to allow the participants to elaborate on, interpret, and discuss their experiences. For the present study, all instances of failed humor were extracted and coded. These were used to construct a typology of failed humor, which identifies seven levels at which a speaker may fail to successfully engage in a humorous exchange. The data suggest that NNS failures differ from those of NSs largely from a quantitative, but not qualitative, standpoint.",,10.1515/iprg.2010.019,https://doi.org/10.1515/iprg.2010.019,forward
Naoko Taguchi,2011.0,"Pragmatic Development as a Dynamic, Complex Process: General Patterns and Case Histories","This longitudinal study asks 2 questions. The first one is: What patterns of pragmatic development can we observe among different pragmatic functions and attributes in a second language (L2)? The second question is: In what ways do individual differences and learning context affect the course of pragmatic development? Forty-eight Japanese college students studying English in an immersion setting in Japan participated in the study. They completed a pragmatic speaking task ( k= 12) that measured their ability to produce 2 speech acts, requests and opinions, in 2 situation types: low-imposition and high-imposition. The task was administered 3 times over 1 academic year. Gains in the appropriateness of the speech acts and fluency of production were analyzed. In addition, a subset of the participants was interviewed to seek the relationship between pragmatic gains and types of sociocultural experiences available on campus. Results revealed that appropriateness showed a profound increase for the low-imposition speech acts, but the production of high-imposition speech acts was slow developing. There was a large increase in speech rate at the initial stage for both situation types, but it showed stagnation at the later stage. Qualitative data revealed an interesting portrayal of the learners' history of participation and socialization related to pragmatic development.

Naoko Taguchi,2018.0,4. Pragmatic competence in foreign language education: Cultivating learner autonomy and strategic learning of pragmatics,"Three decades after the emergence of communicative competence models (e.g. Canale & Swain, 1980), pragmatic competence has established a recognition that learning a language extends beyond grammar. However, language curriculums and instructional materials are seldom pragmatics-focused. Although grammar appears systematically in course syllabi, pragmatics is usually addressed randomly as questions arise, often in conjunction with culture topics. Lack of the systematic appearance of pragmatic features, along with limited range of communicative situations and functions in classroom discourse and textbooks, has led to a general concern that classroom learning is poor in opportunities for pragmatic development (Bardovi-Harlig, 2001). To address this concern, this paper discusses autonomous learning and strategy training as a model of pragmatics pedagogy. Based on the data collected from Japanese ESL students in an immersion setting (Taguchi, 2012), I will illustrate a case of a strategic learner who cultivated a variety of self-directed resources for pragmatics learning, which led to a strong development of pragmatic competence. Based on this case study and drawing on the recent model of strategic self-regulation (Oxford, 2011), I will present the taxonomy of strategy instruction as a way of promoting autonomous learning of pragmatics. Strategy training can be an alternative form of formal instruction, assisting learners to take initiative in learning pragmatics from everyday, non-pragmatics-focused materials.",,10.1515/9781501505034-004,https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501505034-004,forward

"Naoko Taguchi, Feng Xiao, Shuai Li",2016.0,Effects of Intercultural Competence and Social Contact on Speech Act Production in a Chinese Study Abroad Context.,"This study investigated the effects of intercultural competence and amount of social contact in the development of pragmatic knowledge. All these variables were time-varying variables and measured twice over a 3-month study abroad. Participants were 109 American college students studying Chinese in a semester study-abroad program in Beijing. Using Kelley & Meyers's (1995) instrument, intercultural competence-defined as one's potential to succeed in intercultural adjustment-was measured by 4 factors: emotional resilience, flexibility/openness, perceptual acuity, and personal autonomy. A survey was used to assess the amount of time spent on a variety of social activities in Chinese. Pragmatic knowledge was measured with a spoken task, which assessed participants' ability to produce speech acts ( k = 24). Latent Growth Curve Modeling showed that cross-cultural adaptability and social contact, when combined, explained 26% of pragmatic gains. Cross-cultural adaptability had no significant direct effect to speech acts gains: It had indirect effects through social contact.

Students were prompted to use formulaic expressions during their text-based interactions with built-in characters. Several game-like features were incorporated into the practice (e.g., a plot and settings, character selections, and point systems). Pre-, post-, and delayed posttest results showed that students made significant gains in their knowledge of formulaic expressions after the practice, and their knowledge was maintained 2 weeks later. Interviews with individual students revealed some features that motivated them with the practice (e.g., videorecordings of authentic situations, interactions with the characters). However, some students did not perceive the practice as a game-like experience because of the linear, structured nature of the practice and limited decision-making power, leaving room for design improvement in the future.",,10.1111/FLAN.12292,https://doi.org/10.1111/FLAN.12292,forward

 This study explored the relationship between metapragmatic knowledge and transfer of learning from one speech act to another. Using a digital application, 105 Chinese learners of English received implicit instruction on how to formulate a high-imposition request to someone in a higher social status and larger social distance. Immediately after the instruction, they reported what they thought they learned or noticed during the instruction, which served as an indication of their metapragmatic knowledge. After this, they completed immediate and delayed post-tests that assessed their knowledge of the instructed speech act (request-making) as well as their knowledge of the uninstructed speech act, advice-giving (transfer item). Results showed that the participants made significant gains in their productive knowledge of both speech acts after the instruction. The participants’ metapragmatic knowledge significantly correlated with their test performance for both speech acts. These findings indicate that transfer of learning from one speech act to another can occur after instruction. The findings also support that metapragmatic knowledge established during instruction is related to the transfer.",,10.1093/applin/amac043,https://doi.org/10.1093/applin/amac043,forward

Target request head acts in DCT were scored, and request modifications were analyzed for frequency. The collaborative group outperformed the individual group on the production of the head act at immediate post. No group difference was found in request modifications.

Research has highlighted that second and foreign language learners show significant differences from native speakers in language use, in particular, with the execution and comprehension of certain speech acts (Bardovi-Harlig & Mahan-Taylor, 2003). Without effective instruction, differences in pragmatics are evident in the English of learners regardless of their first language background or language proficiency. In EFL contexts, such as Japan, where learners have limited exposure to native speaker norms, teaching and learning pragmatic competence can be particularly challenging. The authors describe an ongoing curriculum development project in a Japanese university context, where the goal is to design and implement an effective approach to teaching interlanguage pragmatics. Digitally enhanced Strategic Interaction (SI) sequences (Di Pietro, 1987) provide opportunities for learners to engage in realistic interactive situations that are mediated by use of model conversations, an online wiki space, and digital video technologies. The online space provides opportunities for learner reflection, peer assisted feedback, and detailed intervention from the instructor. Data analysis from pre- and post- written discourse completion tasks suggests that learners are able to use language in more context sensitive ways having engaged with the teaching/learning cycle design.",,10.4018/jsita.2013010104,https://doi.org/10.4018/jsita.2013010104,ancestry

As derived from the 2,106 scores generated, the quantitative results showed that both experimental groups significantly outperformed the control group. The qualitative results from content analysis of the interviewers’ 341 comments captured in video-stimulated recalls showed that various themes related to language ability featured most prominently in interviewer evaluations; the themes also differentiated above-average and below-average-rated candidates. The study underscores the extent to which communicative performance swayed interviewers’ judgements above other variables; these judgements in turn may prove a disadvantage for EAL candidates in their job interviews and thus merit the critical awareness and reflection of EAL candidates, interviewers, and trainers alike.",,10.1093/applin/amaa051,https://doi.org/10.1093/applin/amaa051,forward

The study employed an instructional experimental design over a 6-month period with 34 Chinese students assigned to either an explicitly instructed group or a control group receiving no instruction. Instruction took place prior to departure for the UK and performance was measured based on a pretest-posttest design using an oral computer-animated production test (CAPT). This paper explores the data in two specific ways. Firstly, the request data were analysed at the pre-and delayed test stages (six months into the study abroad period) to analyse the extent to which participants' reliance on L1 request strategies and language changes over time. Secondly, we measured the amount and type of contact with English which participants reported prior to and six months into the study abroad period. Results show that instruction facilitated development of pragmatically appropriate request language over time, with instructed learners showing significantly less reliance on L1 transfer than non-instructed learners. Contact with English increased significantly for both groups on all measures of language production but not all receptive contact with English. When compared, there was no significant difference between the groups' contact with English at each stage, suggesting that instruction did not result in significantly more interaction with English during the study abroad period.",,10.29140/ICE.V2N2.162,https://doi.org/10.29140/ICE.V2N2.162,forward

An investigation into the effects of video-driven prompts on less-studied and more complex teaching speech acts, such as complaints, will significantly supplement the inconclusive results of pragmatic interventional studies in foreign language contexts. To this end, the present study aims to investigate the effects of metapragmatic instruction on English complaints through the implementation of video-driven prompts to raise Saudi female EFL students’ awareness of the pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic aspects associated with the production of appropriate and accurate target-like complaints during one academic semester. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to collect data from 62 English majors, assigned to an experimental group (n = 31) and a conventional group (n = 31), at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia. To elicit the required data, a proficiency test and pre-/post-test written discourse completion tests (WDCT) were distributed among participants. The results of the posttest demonstrated significant improvement in participants’ pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic skills in the production of English complaints. The experimental group immensely outperformed the control group due to their exposure to authentic, contextualized video excerpts. The study supports the teachability of complaints as well as the benefits of incorporating metapragmatic awareness tasks based on contextually authentic input, which can, in turn, accelerate EFL students’ ability to produce pragmatically appropriate and accurate target-like complaints.",,10.31235/osf.io/n9uc7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n9uc7,forward

These approaches, however, have been used only to improve learners’ linguistic ability despite communicative models of language which pointed that knowledge of language also involves pragmatic ability (Bachman, 1990; Bachman & Palmer, 1996). The present study tries to explore the effect of two alternative assessment approaches (self-assessment and conference) on students’ production of four speech acts (apology, complaint, request, and refusal) plus politeness markers. A sample of 64 EFL students participated in this study. Metapragmatic explanations were given to three groups of university students studying English as a foreign language. The two treatment groups received instruction through self-assessment and conference and a comparison group was exposed to the conventional one-shot testing. The results of the One-Way ANOVA conducted after the treatment revealed an outperformance of alternative assessment approaches to the conventional one in the production of the four speech acts and politeness markers in WDCTs. A qualitative analysis of students’ self-ratings in the self-assessment group revealed that they focused more on linguistic criteria during the initial sessions and on pragmatic ones by the end of the treatment. It can be concluded that alternative assessment approaches are beneficial to students’ production of speech acts and politeness markers. In the end, the applicability and the positive effect of alternative approaches in pragmatic assessment are emphasized.",,10.22111/IJALS.2013.1642,https://doi.org/10.22111/IJALS.2013.1642,forward

In addition to this technique, instructors make use of field experience to give input to learners. Regarding the pragmatic communicative practice techniques, the quantitative and qualitative results showed that instructors mostly make use of role-play and pair- work techniques to engage learners to practice speech acts. Moreover, the results of the questionnaire and interview with regard to pragmatic corrective feedback techniques showed that instructors almost give feedback implicitly by reformulating learners’ mistakes and repeating their errors On the contrary, instructors give less metalinguistic information and explain the inappropriate expressions to learners.

However, ESL students in these educational institutions encounter numerous challenges to write email to their professors because of their unfamiliarity with email etiquette in English, inadequate English language proficiency, and lack of understanding of socio-cultural norms and values. Also, writing emails to professors requires higher pragmatic competence and critical language awareness of how email correspondence takes place in academic setting. Email requests written by ESL students are often seen as inappropriate or informal by their professors, resulting in pragmatic failure and being rejected.

This study examines the complexity of word order scrambling in L3 Korean from cross-linguistic perspective, and investigates the influence of L2 learning experience in L3 acquisition by novice early bilingual learners (English-Chinese/Malay) in Singapore (n=148). An untimed grammaticality judgement task (GJT), which manipulates Case-assigning cues (e.g. word order, animacy and case-marking morphemes) for competition, was employed to investigate an impact of word order scrambling and item grammaticality. Given different cue hierarchy among involved languages, learners experience a challenge in unlearning LI reliance on word order and animacy cues in Case assignment and adjusting to the novel cue hierarchy of L3 Korean. Conflicting information between animacy cue and word order cue triggers negative judgment on the GJT regardless of the sentences' true grammaticality. Irrespective of typological proximity of L2, L2 learning experience is found to be facilitative in the acquisition of scrambled structure of L3, conditionally on ungrammatical sentences. We argue that these findings imply that general L2 learning experience benefits learners with control ability to effectively conform to a new cue hierarchy based on L3 exposure, and that such enhanced metalinguistic awareness is more visible when learners are handling tasks that require explicit knowledge.", Journal Article,10.17250/khisli.39..202209.001,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/beneficial-effect-multilingualism-resolving-l3/docview/2724916313/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

DA is distinguished by its insistence that an individual's independent performance of assessment tasks reveals only part of his/her abilities, namely those that have completed their development at the time of the assessment; insights into abilities that have begun to emerge but have not yet fully developed can be determined according to an individual's responsiveness to particular kinds of support, referred to as mediation (e.g., reminders, leading questions, hints, provision of a model, feedback), offered during the assessment as difficulties arise (Haywood &amp; Lidz, 2006). In this respect, DA differs from more conventional distinctions in assessment, such as that between assessments concerned with the results of previous learning (‘summative assessment’) and those intended to provide information relevant to subsequent instruction (‘formative assessment’). Instead, the embedding of an interactive, instructional element within the assessment procedure allows for the possibility of expanding the evidential basis upon which summative interpretations of learner abilities are made; that is, the results encompass previous learning that has resulted in both complete and partial understanding of relevant concepts. At the same time, DA serves a formative function in so far as interaction allows insights into the underlying sources of learner difficulties and the kind of support to which they are most responsive (Sternberg &amp; Grigorenko, 2002).", Journal Article,10.1017/S0261444820000555,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/dynamic-assessment-second-language-development/docview/2612320967/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Besides, the request kind of directive is employed by English teachers in online classroom interactions at a significantly higher frequency than any other form of directive speech acts.",,10.33541/jet.v9i2.4566,https://doi.org/10.33541/jet.v9i2.4566,forward

The concepts of self-presentation, social distance, and power were the focus of a pedagogical enrichment program in 2 sections of a beginning-level Spanish class at a northeastern U.S. university. The concepts were illustrated by the Spanish second person pronoun system (i.e., tu vs. usted). The analysis centers on preenrichment and postenrichment performances on 3 tasks: (a) a language awareness survey, (b) an appropriateness judgment task, and (c) a written discourse completion task. Results show positive gains in conceptual sociopragmatic knowledge and the ability to apply this knowledge when making pragmalinguistic choices.

R. Ellis,2018.0,Meta-analysis in second language acquisition research,"
 Meta-analysis has become increasingly popular in second language acquisition research (SLA) and has provided valuable summative
 information about a number of key areas. There are, however, dangers. This article examines a number of key issues that need to be
 considered in conducting a meta-analysis – inclusiveness, the heterogeneity of language learners, the definition of the
 independent and dependent variables, the need to consider alternative explanations of observed effects, the importance of
 examining the quality of the studies included in the analysis, and the apples and oranges problem. These issues are illustrated in
 a discussion of number of SLA meta-analyses (e.g. Norris and Ortega, 2000; Plonsky, 2011; Qureshi, 2016; Spada and Tomita, 2010). The article concludes by suggesting a number of factors that
 need to be considered in deciding whether to conduct a meta-analysis and when carrying one out. I argue the need for systematic
 reviews but suggest that these can often best present their findings in narrative form rather than statistically. I also suggest
 that a preliminary narrative account of the findings of s systematic review can indicate whether a meta-analysis is
 appropriate.",,10.1075/JSLS.00002.ELL,https://doi.org/10.1075/JSLS.00002.ELL,forward

R. Mapson,2015.0,Paths to politeness: exploring how professional interpreters develop an understanding of politeness norms in British Sign Language and English,": This chapter explores how bimodal bilinguals acquire and develop their awareness of politeness in British Sign Language (BSL). Drawing on data collected through semi-structured group discussions involving eight highly experienced BSL/English interpreters the chapter focuses on how the participants learned about linguistic politeness in BSL and how this contrasts with their acquisition of English politeness norms. The data indicate how di ﬀ erent paths to the acquisition of linguistic politeness might a ﬀ ect understanding of it. The experience of interpreters from Deaf family backgrounds, who acquired BSL as their ﬁ rst language, contrasts with those who learned BSL formally, as an additional language, as adults. Although both groups of participants acquired knowledge of politeness in similar arenas, the languages they were exposed to in these environments di ﬀ ered and intra-group experiences were heterogeneous. The data highlight the di ﬃ culty of learning politeness norms in an L2, with participants reporting a lack of explicit focus on politeness in BSL classes and interpreter training programmes. This may re ﬂ ect the lack of literature on polite-ness in signed language, and on BSL in particular. Both groups of interpreters reported experiences involving the negative transfer of L1 politeness norms. Data indicate that the di ﬀ erent modalities of BSL and English may facilitate transferability rather than restrict it, with one a ﬀ ordance being the ‘ blended transfer ’ of non-manual politeness features associated with BSL which may be performed simultaneously with spoken English.",,10.1515/9781501501654-007,https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501501654-007,forward

Rachel L. Shively,2010.0,From the virtual world to the real world: a model of pragmatics instruction for study abroad,"Abstract: With its focus on the use of language forms in cultural context, the study of pragmatics can be a valuable component in a program that prepares students to learn both language and culture in study abroad. The goal of the present study is to propose a model for pragmatic instruction in study abroad that fosters both intercultural competence and language skills, is informed by research and practice, and takes advantage of the affordances that an immersion environment and new technologies offer. The article provides an overview of the pertinent research, discusses the pedagogical implications of an ethnographic research project on the acquisition of Spanish pragmatics in study abroad, and presents a model for pragmatic instruction in the study abroad context. Key words: intercultural competence, pedagogical intervention, pragmatic development, second language acquisition, study abroad As a second rather than a foreign language environment, the study abroad (SA) context is considered by some to constitute, a priori, a ''rich'' environment for language and culture learning. However, research in the past two decades indicates that SA students do not always experience the intense exposure to the target language (TL) and culture and the accompanying gains in language proficiency and intercultural competence that were once assumed (DeKeyser, 1991; Freed, 1999; Laubscher, 1994; Miller & Ginsberg, 1995; Pelligrino, 1998; Wilkinson, 1998). In some cases, for example, SA students do not improve their TL skills more than peers who stay at home and study the TL (cf. Freed, 1995; Rodri'guez, 2001). The reasons why a sojourn abroad does not always result in the expected language- and culture-learning outcomes are numerous and complex (cf. Kinginger& Belz, 2005; Magnan & Back, 2007; Pelligrino, 1998; Polanyi, 1995). For example, opportunities for social interaction with members of the host culture may be restricted by difficulty in making contacts (Barron, 2003; Ife, 2000), by experiences of racial and gender discrimination (Polanyi, 1995; Talburt & Stewart, 1999), and by living arrangements (Churchill, 2003; Knight & Schmidt-Rinehart, 2002). However, one way to foster positive language- and culture-learning outcomes in SA is to provide students with training and instruction in language and culture (La Brack, 1993; Paige, Cohen, & Shively, 2004). Of particular interest to the present study is how instruction can assist SA students in the development of their TL pragmatic competence. Pragmatic competence refers to the knowledge and skills needed to use and interpret the meanings, assumptions, and actions expressed by language in its sociocultural context. Research on second language (L2) pragmatic development suggests that pragmatic abilities are acquired rather slowly during naturalistic acquisition (Olshtain & Blum-Kulka, 1985). Not surprisingly then, in the context of a 4- to 9- month SA experience, uninstructed L2 learners typically make only minor gains in target-like pragmatic competence (cf. Barron, 2003; Cohen & Shively, 2007; DuFon, 1999; Hoffman-Hicks, 1999). At the same time, L2 learners in instructed settings have generally been found to benefit from instruction that targets pragmatic features of the TL (Bardovi-Harlig, 2001; Rose & Kasper, 2001), suggesting that instruction can accelerate learning. In addition to the use of face-to-face classroom activities to teach L2 pragmatics, recent studies have indicated how new technologies such as interactive Web sites, synchronous chat, and virtual environments can be effectively used to facilitate pragmatic development (Belz, 2005; Gonza 'lez-Lloret, 2008; Ishihara, 2007; Sykes, 2008). While some authors have bemoaned growing access to technology in SA because it can allow students to disengage from the host culture (cf. Citron, 2003; Ogden, 2006), I argue here that rather than discouraging technology use, SA programs would do better to harness SA students' interest in new technologies as a means to reengage them with language and culture at all stages of SA (cf. …",,10.1111/J.1944-9720.2010.01063.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1944-9720.2010.01063.X,ancestry

This study investigated how willingness to communicate (WTC), learner subjectivity, and anxiety in learning the L2 correlate with Iranian students’ English pragmatic knowledge. To this end, a total of 140 participants received instruction on request strategy types and their internal and external modification devices for seven weeks through consciousness-raising tasks.

The findings indicated that WTC and learner subjectivity correlated positively with the participants’ L2 pragmatic competence. However, no relationship was observed between the learners’ anxiety and their pragmatic achievement. The results suggest that some personal characteristics such as WTC and learner subjectivity are significant contributors to success in acquiring L2 pragmatic knowledge. چکیده: تفاوت های فردی زبان آموزان نقش غیر قابل انکاری در یادگیری زبان دوم ایفا میکنند و محققان علاقه مند نخواهند توانست به درک کامل و درستی از یادگیری زبان دوم برسند اگر چنین متغیرهای مهمی را نادیده بگیرند. این مطالعه به بررسی چگونگی ارتباط تمایل به برقراری ارتباط کلامی (WTC)،  فردیت زبان آموز و اضطراب در یادگیری زبان دوم با دانش منظور شناسی زبان آموزان ایرانی می پردازد. برای این منظور، در مجموع 140 نفر در مورد انواع استراتژی های درخواست و ابزارهای اصلاحی داخلی و خارجی آنها برای هفت هفته از طریق وظایف آگاهی-دهنده (آگاهی برانگیز) مورد آموزش قرار گرفتند. داده ها با استفاده از پرسشنامه های تمایل به برقراری ارتباط کلامی، فردیت، مقیاس اضطراب در کلاس های زبان خارجی و آزمون تکمیل گفتمان جمع آوری گردیدند. یافته های تحقیق حاکی از این داشتند که تمایل به برقراری ارتباط کلامی و فردیت زبان آموزان به طور مثبت با توانایی منظور شناسی آنها در زبان دوم ارتباط داشت. با این وجود، بین اضطراب زبان آموزان و توانایی منظور شناسی آنها در زبان دوم ارتباطی مشاهده نشد. نتایج نشان می دهند که برخی ویژگی های شخصی مانند تمایل به برقراری ارتباط کلامی و فردیت زبان آموزان از اهمیت ویژه و نقش بسزایی درکسب موفقیت آمیز دانش منظور شناسی در زبان دوم برخوردار است. واژگان کلیدی:تمایل به برقراری ارتباط کلامی، فردیت، اضطراب، درخواست، توانایی منظور شناسی",,10.22108/ARE.2017.78045.0,https://doi.org/10.22108/ARE.2017.78045.0,forward
"Rasoul Mohammad Hosseinpur, Reza Bagheri Nevisi",2018.0,L1-based Instruction: Does It Work for Learning Pragmatics in the EFL Context?,"An overview of interventional studies in the field of interlanguage pragmatics reveals that researchers and practitioners were first concerned with the teachability of pragmatics. Their findings indicated that particular features of pragmatics are teachable, and instruction is both necessary and effective (e.g., Alcon-Soler, 2008; Alcon-Soler & Martinez-Flor, 2008; Jeon & Kaya, 2006; Ishihara & Cohen, 2010; Martinez-Flor & Uso-Juan, 2010; Rose, 2005; Rose & Kasper, 2001). The second issue in the ILP research dealt with the question of exposure versus instruction. The findings demonstrated that pedagogical intervention is more helpful for pragmatic learning than exposure to positive evidence (e.g., Alcon-Soler, 2005; Eslami-Rasekh & Eslami-Rasekh, 2008; Jeon & Kaya, 2006; Takahashi, 2010). Due to the consensus over the need to teach pragmatic competence, the main issue now centers on the question of how this competence should be attended to in the most effective way. A compelling body of interventional studies has targeted explicit/deductive and implicit/inductive teaching designs, generally suggesting an overall trend in support of explicit/deductive instruction (e.g., Ishihara, 2010; Martinez-Flor & Uso-Juan, 2010; Takahashi, 2010). This interest has overshadowed a third possibility: the employment of learners‟ mother tongue which has recently received a remarkable amount of attention in second language acquisition (SLA) research (e.g., Cheng, 2013; Lee & Macaro, 2013). Therefore, drawing on an already established means of pragmatic instruction and a recently growing trend in the classroom, the present study is an attempt to compare and contrast the relative effectiveness of explicit/deductive and L1-based instruction of pragmatic competence.",,10.18823/ASIATEFL.2018.15.1.18.233,https://doi.org/10.18823/ASIATEFL.2018.15.1.18.233,forward

 strategy inventory indicated that instruction had a significant impact on participants’ utilization of speech act strategies. It also came
 to light that the learners were generally receptive to deductive and L1-based pragmatic C-R tasks. The findings suggest that pragmatic C-R
 tasks and especially L1-based tasks are effective means for applying strategies to supporting learners in the acquisition of speech acts.",,10.1075/ps.16066.hos,https://doi.org/10.1075/ps.16066.hos,forward

This study was an attempt to compare and contrast Written Discourse Completion Task (WDCT), Oral Discourse Completion Task (ODCT), and Role-play with Natural methodology in an EFL institutional context to see which measure approximated Natural methodology. To this end, data (requests) were collected from 27 intermediate–level Iranian EFL learners in a natural classroom institutional context over 15 weeks, and then the WDCTs, ODCTs, and Role-plays with the same contextual features were selected to elicit the intended data. The participants’ requests were transcribed and analyzed in terms of Schauer’s (2009) request head act strategy taxonomy and its internal and external modification devices. The results of Binominal tests indicated that, in spite of some minor similarities, none of the elicitation measures could approximate the natural data. The participants’ employment of direct, non-conventionally indirect request strategies, and internal and external modification devices were more conspicuous in the WDCTs, ODCTs, and Role-plays than those in the Natural methodology.

"Rastelli, Stefano",2023.0,Telic for whom? The Lexical Underspecification Hypothesis,"The Aspect Hypothesis (AH) claims that L2 beginners use the perfective morpheme first with telic predicates (e.g., ‘arrive’, ‘build the house’) and only later with atelic ones (e.g., ‘know’, ‘work’). In contrast, the Lexical Underspecification Hypothesis (LUH) claims that beginners cannot represent the lexical aspect of L2 predicates (hence the telic vs. atelic distinction), because this distinction is a separate component of verb meaning. To investigate whether L2 learners distinguish between telic and atelic predicates, this study compares the responses from 299 L2 Italian learners (with different L1 backgrounds) and responses from 91 native speakers (NS) to the “ for / in + time span” adverbial test (Dowty 1979 ). The analysis shows that native speakers and L2 learners’ responses to the adverbial test diverge significantly, with learners’ proficiency and – to a lesser extent – L1 modulating their ratings. The results suggest that native speakers and beginning-intermediate L2 learners might not represent telicity alike, either because L2 aspectual competence is still developing or because beginning learners rely on the semantic representations of their L1. These findings support the predictions of the LUH and suggest caution when trying to assess learners’ aspectual representations.", Journal Article,10.1017/cnj.2023.3,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/telic-whom-lexical-underspecification-hypothesis/docview/2852154807/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Moghadasi",2020.0,"Content Analysis of Iranian High School English Textbooks in terms of Politeness Markers, Speech Acts, and Language Functions","Considering the indispensable role pragmatic knowledge plays in not only comprehending L2 materials, but also in making and maintaining proper communication, and the fact that Iranian EFL learners are primarily exposed to the target language through textbooks, this research intended to discern how frequently and appropriately Politeness Markers (PMs), Speech Acts (SAs), and Language Functions (LFs) are being incorporated in newly-published Iranian high school English textbooks: Prospect and Vision Series. Furthermore, the study set out to investigate the possible relations between the level of the textbooks and the frequency of pragmatic components being included. To this end, 172 conversations of the aforementioned textbooks were thoroughly analyzed to determine the frequency of the PMs based on House and Kasper (1981) taxonomy, the frequency of SAs based on Searle's (1979) paradigm, and the frequency of LFs according to Halliday’s (1978) framework. Findings revealed that Committers were the most frequently-used PMs, Representatives and Directives were the most commonly-used SAs, and Informatives enjoyed the highest frequency among LFs. The results also indicated that these pragmatic components were not equally distributed throughout the conversations and no significant relationship existed between level of the textbooks and frequency of the pragmatic elements. In addition to the consciousness-raising dimension of the study, material developers might be able to appropriately represent and include pragmatic information into their materials. Moreover, teachers might also be able to amend and modify their adopted approaches to foreign language teaching and adjust them to accommodate potential learner styles and their preferences.",,10.22054/ILT.2021.54493.529,https://doi.org/10.22054/ILT.2021.54493.529,forward

Fifty-two Iranian English students took part in this research project. First, the two questionnaires (i.e. ideal L2 self and ought-to L2 self) adopted from Dornyei and Taguchi (2010) were distributed among the participants. Moreover, the participants went through a six-week instructional period and received pragmatic instruction at the end of their regular class hour for thirty minutes. Finally, all the participants were required to complete two discourse completion tests containing eight scenarios borrowed from both Schauer’s (2009), and Jalilifar’s (2009) as pretest and posttest. This would enable the researchers to assess the participants’ pre- and post-instructional pragmatic knowledge. Descriptive statistics and independent samples t-tests were run to analyze the data. The findings indicate that high ideal L2 self group significantly outperformed the high ought-to L2 self group with regard to their pragmatic performances on discourse completion tests. The study further implies that factors such as the individuals’ ideal L2 self can be regarded as determining and pivotal when it comes to the amount of learning that takes place in learners with either high ideal L2 self or those with high ought-to L2 self.",,10.22051/LGHOR.2020.28265.1188,https://doi.org/10.22051/LGHOR.2020.28265.1188,forward

In the following study, a single event from a Finnish third-grade EFL-mediated geography lesson is studied by combining insights from three research approaches: sociocultural, socio-cognitive, and discourse-pragmatic. The data analysis focuses on how during concept formation, the participants use commonplace means present in every classroom – textbook and chalkboard, spoken and written, verbal and nonverbal communicative means – to construct knowledge and its social context. The results indicate that there exist strong parallels among the ways the various means are used by the participants in the activity, and that this pattern coincides with the changes in the teacher’s control of classroom interaction.

But in fact this goal can often not be achieved. Many learners in higher education master the German grammar and vocabulary, but they are unable to use German language that matches the social context, because they do not have much pragmatics competence. Pragmatic approach based on the function of language as a communication tool is a study of language by involving various aspects outside the language that are able to provide meaning. Pragmatic competence constitutes a significant factor in determining the success of communication.  In fact, a German language learner in higher education is not only expected to use language and produce utterances which are understandable or grammatically correct, but is also expected to produce utterances which are socioculturally appropriate. However, for students in higher education who learn German as a Foreign Language (Deutsch als Fremdsprache/DaF), the pragmatic competence, which can actually be acquired naturally through social interaction, is quite difficult to acquire due to the limited. On this basis, pragmatics needs to be integrated into German language courses in higher education, which includes pragma linguistics and socio pragmatic. In this regard, this study describes not only the relationship between pragmatics and German as a foreign language, but also this study is an attempt to define its implications in teaching German as foreign language in higher education.",,10.33258/BIRLE.V3I1.853,https://doi.org/10.33258/BIRLE.V3I1.853,forward

We provide data from successful English-speaking learners of L2 Spanish at the initial state of acquiring L3 French and L3 Italian relating to properties of the Null-Subject Parameter (e.g. Chomsky, 1981; Rizzi, 1982). We compare these groups to each other, as well as to groups of English learners of L2 French and L2 Italian at the initial state, and conclude that the data are consistent with the predictions of the 'L2 status factor'. However, we discuss an alternative possible interpretation based on (psycho)typologically-motivated transfer (borrowing from Kellerman, 1983), providing a methodology for future research in this domain to meaningfully tease apart the 'L2 status factor' from this alternative account.

The study of the development of L2 pragmatics is a promising and a vibrant area of investigation since in many of the L2 environments, Turkey being an example, communicative competence is a neglected area with the focus being on grammatical competence. What language teachers are doing in classrooms is often the teaching of grammar rules, undeniably important but never ensure the teaching of effective communicative skills alone. The teaching of “structural, functional and affective” power of the language in actual use through student projects and classroom discussion of both on the structure, the function and the effect may well help learners to become effective communicators. After the emergence of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) in 1980s, today, at least in the last three decades, people in the field are in search of improving the shortcomings of CLT. Though a number of methods have been introduced on overcoming the limitations of CLT, they only serve to complement a very small area of the gap attributed to CLT. On the other hand, TBLT, introduced to language teaching market by Prabhu, embraces quite a large area that CLT has left behind. This specific study will, thus, search for ways to raise awareness of Turkish EFL teachers through course book analysis 1 Yrd. Doç.

It is a language spoken in South Sumatera, Indonesia, henceforth referred to as Palembangnese. The overall goal of this paper is to contribute to the wider literature on the use of directives. However, in particular, this paper aims to enrich the current understanding of data from linguistic politeness in Palembangnese, especially the usage of Palembangnese when the students are making directives, both in their verbal interactions with each other and with their professors or lecturers. A large number of studies have been conducted on directives in relation to politeness in different languages. However, up to now, limited research concerning the politeness and the use of directives in Palembangnese has been conducted. Twenty Indonesian students in Indonesia were recruited as participants. The participants of this study were native Palembangnese speakers in Indonesia (PSinI). This research based its argument on a corpus data elicited by means of a Palembangnese version of Written Discourse Completion Tasks (WDCTs), demographic information questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews. The data were analyzed and focused on five major politeness strategies proposed by Brown and Levinson (1978). The results of the study contribute to the increased understanding of politeness and the use of directives in Palembangnese. This present research contributes to teaching and learning in university settings by providing better understandings of the association between cultures, including beliefs and values, and politeness strategies of students from Palembangnese language backgrounds.

It emerged to respond to the challenge of implementing DA in large classes and to meet the psychometric properties of assessment. To this end, the present study attempted to design a unique computerized dynamic assessment tool to diagnose learners’ development of pragmatic competence, specifically their knowledge of the speech acts of apology and request. To conduct the research, a number of 60 BSc students of engineering, aged 18-24, participated in the study. They had different proficiency levels, including pre-intermediate, intermediate and upper-intermediate levels. In the course of CDA, they were provided with 30 multiple choice discourse completion tests of apology and request and they were required to choose what they would say in that specific situation. The participants received pre-established meditational hints for each of the unacceptable responses, which were arranged from the most implicit to the most explicit. Finally, to diagnose learners’ development, their test performance, including their actual score, mediated score and learning potential score (LPS), was instantly displayed. Paired samples t-test showed development in learners’ mediated score. The results of the univariate analysis of variance showed that there is no interaction between mediation and proficiency level.

Methodologically, the study is largely based on the Bardovi-Harlig & Dörnyei (1998) study on pragmatic awareness. However, unlike the former, it does not compare SL and FL learners, but two groups of SL learners with different length of residence in Greece. Hence, it attempts to reach conclusions with respect to the impact of residence on the development of pragmatic awareness. It is shown that both learner groups consistently recognise grammatical violations with greater frequency than pragmatic ones and rate the former as more severe than the latter. It is concluded that for this particular learner sample, length of residence alone is not a sufficient condition for the development of pragmatic awareness. The suggestion is made that this is due at least partly to the special circumstances of the participants, which do not allow for sufficient opportunities for social contact with native speakers. The conclusions have important implications both for the role of the L2 setting in pragmatic development and for language instruction.",,10.1515/mult.2012.001,https://doi.org/10.1515/mult.2012.001,forward

S. García,2019.0,Teaching apologies through the use of audiovisual materials,"Since Austin’s (1962) classic work How To Do Things With Words there have been numerous studies about the way in which utterances are used as a mean to perform actions. The branch of linguistics that deals with this phenomenon is pragmatics, which emerged in the 1960s as a reaction to Chomsky’s idea that the importance of language lies in the correct use of grammar (MartinezFlor and Uso-Juan 2010). After the elaboration of several models of communicative competence presented by a number of authors such as Canale and Swain (1980), Bachman (1990), and Celce-Murcia (1995, 2007), the idea that pragmatic awareness is necessary in order for speakers to be successful in communication has spread, being one of the most relevant constructs the one introduced by CelceMurcia (2007). Research has been conducted especially on speech acts, such as Leech’s (2014) book The Pragmatics of Politeness, whose taxonomy will be used in this study, and on the use of audiovisual material for teaching purposes. For that reason, we have carried out an analysis on speech acts, and in particular on apologies, in the fiction TV series The Big Bang Theory. The aim of this study is to analyse whether apologies in the nine episodes examined mirror real-life conversations, and if so, to show that this audiovisual material may be used for classroom activities as an appropriate tool to develop students’ pragmatic knowledge.",,10.6035/forumrecerca.2018.23.22,https://doi.org/10.6035/forumrecerca.2018.23.22,forward

To this end, 80 English-major university students formed four intact experimental groups: two literary and two nonliterary groups. One of the literary groups (Implicit Play) received typographically enhanced plays containing the speech acts of apology, request, and refusal, and the other (Explicit Play) received the same plus metapragmatic instruction on the speech acts. The medium of instruction for the nonliterary groups were dialogs containing the given functions; they were also given either enhanced input (Implicit Dialog) or input plus metapragmatic information (Explicit Dialog). All the groups took a written discourse completion test (WDCT) and a multiple-choice discourse completion test (MDCT) before and after instruction. Analysis of the groups’ performance on the WDCT pretest and posttest did not show an advantage for the literary medium, that is, there was no significant difference between literary and nonliterary groups. It was rather the mode of instruction that mattered most; explicit groups outperformed their implicit counterparts. As for the groups’ performance on the MDCT pre and posttest, analyses revealed that the groups had improved, but there was no significant difference among the groups as a result of the four teaching conditions, suggesting that pragmatic instruction regardless of the medium and mode of teaching can improve learners’ knowledge of speech acts.",,10.18823/ASIATEFL.2018.15.4.12.1065,https://doi.org/10.18823/ASIATEFL.2018.15.4.12.1065,forward

To this end, a researcher-developed Written Discourse Completion Task (WDCT) was utilized to collect data from 61 participants: a. treatment group (20), b. control group (23), and c. native speakers (18). The data were categorized based on a framework adapted from Blum-Kulka et al. (1989b) and Schauer's (2009) coding schemes for internal and external modifications. The results suggested that, in the pretest, Iranian EFL learners’ use of request modification strategies differed significantly from native speakers’ norms. It was found that that after the Bloom-based ILP instruction, the treatment group progressed towards native speakers' norms in the application of several modification strategies.

Due to severe negative consequences of failure in performing and interpreting speech acts such as request, the present study made an attempt to investigate the effect of concept mapping on learning English requests by Iranian high school students. To this aim, 72 male students of grade two from two high schools in Gonabad participated in the study. The participants were two intact groups ranging from 15 to 18 years old. Data for this study were collected using English Test- Beginner (proficiency test) and Written Discourse Completion Task (WDCT). The results indicated there was a statistically significant difference between the request speech act knowledge of those learners who were taught requests through concept mapping and those who were taught traditionally. Therefore, concept mapping strategy outweighed the traditional one in learning English requests. The results of the current study have important implications for syllabus designer and material writers to have a new insight to the content of syllabi and textbooks especially for EFL context.

In the Valencian Community in Spain, the coexistence of Spanish and Catalan as co-official languages and English as a foreign language, which is learned as a third language (L3), shapes a unique multilingual setting. This study examined the extent to which multilingual learners’ use of two interpersonal pragmatic markers (PMs), i.e., hedges (e.g., I believe) and attitude markers (e.g., fortunately), is related across languages and whether the relationship changes over time. Participants were 313 Spanish-Catalan bilingual high school learners of L3 English. They wrote three opinion essays over one academic year in the three languages of instruction: Spanish, Catalan, and English. Quantitative results revealed a trend towards stronger correlations over time in both PMs. At Time 3, correlations were statistically significant for all language pairs in hedges and for two language pairs in attitude markers (Spanish and Catalan, Spanish and English). Qualitative analyses of the learners’ essays lend support to these results and show transfer at the phrase and discourse-level.",,10.1075/ap.20024.mar,https://doi.org/10.1075/ap.20024.mar,forward

Drawing on Herbert’s (1986), Mile (1994), Rose and Kwai-Fun (2001), and also the data of the current study, 18 types of compliment responses were identified. Based on different compliment topics [such as appearance, ability, possession and nationality], the researcher along with 12 others as assistants who were instructed how to give compliments got engaged in conversations with different people to compliment them. They complimented people from various professions, contexts, cities and educational levels. The majority [67.6%] of our corpus of 756 naturally occurring compliment responses fell into the main category of “agreement”. However, the absence of the compliment response “no-acknowledgement ”, the high rate of two or three part appreciation token along with a significant portion of “ making offer” attest to the culturally-specific Iranian features such as modesty and Ta’arof. Additionally, no significant differences were found between males and females in terms of compliment response types, or the degree of modesty or Ta’arof. Nonetheless, there existed significant differences with regard to topics of compliment in a sense that most of the compliments given on nationality (89%) were accepted while in the case of physical and mental domain, it was not that much high. Like other studies in pragmatic area, this study also indicates that compliment response is cross-naturally varied, different, and hence warrants more attention in instruction and material development.",,10.7575/IJALEL.V.2N.1P.44,https://doi.org/10.7575/IJALEL.V.2N.1P.44,forward

Thirty university-level ESL learners completed four pragmatic speaking tasks that differ in the formality of pragmatic actions. Two trained raters scored the task-based pragmatic performances using analytical rating criteria and displayed a satisfactory level of consistency and accuracy in scoring the performances. The test-takers’ retrospective reports were transcribed and analyzed to develop a valid coding scheme that consists of cognitive, metacognitive, and pragmatic strategies. An association between the test-takers’ pragmatic performances scored by the trained raters and their reported strategy use was examined. The higher-ability test takers utilized diverse strategies more frequently, ranging from varied pragmatic strategies to strategies specifically related to managing task demands, compared to the lower-ability test takers. Further, the test takers utilized distinct types of strategies appropriate to handling unique pragmatic task situations and complexities involved in each pragmatic assessment task. These findings explain how the test takers cognitively interacted with the assessment tasks and what strategies potentially led to successful pragmatic performances. The implications of examining pragmatic strategy use were discussed in terms of advancing practices of teaching and assessing L2 pragmatics.",,10.1515/ip-2019-0009,https://doi.org/10.1515/ip-2019-0009,forward

Saeedeh Shokouhi,2016.0,An Overview on Explicit and Implicit instructions on Learners’ Pragmatic Awareness in Making Request in English,"One of the important part of the pragmatics studies in recent years is about the intercultural communication. EFL learners should know both grammatical competence and also sociolinguistic rules to use the language in an appropriate context. This review explores the effect of the explicit and implicit instruction on the learners’ attention in the production of the speech act of request. Pragmatics includes “the study of how speakers use and understand speech acts” (Richards and Schmidt 2002). Moreover, pragmatics plays a very important role in the production and perception of the language. That is why interlocutors should have enough pragmatic knowledge to produce and perceive the proper and intended speech acts based on context. Therefore, having pragmatic competence is one of the key factors in the process of communication. Pragmatic competence in foreign language contexts is defined as the knowledge of communicative action or speech acts, how to perform it, and the ability to utilize the language in proper ways based on the context or contextual factors (Kasper 1997; Kasper & Roever 2005).",,10.5296/JSEL.V4I1.9408,https://doi.org/10.5296/JSEL.V4I1.9408,forward

The early studies by Manes and Wolfson (1981) report the formulaicity of compliments in American English. Finally, this review shows that teachers should pay more attention to pragmatics and teaching it in the classroom. Lack of pragmatic knowledge may cause a failure in communication.

Anderson’s adaptive control of thought–rational (ACT-R) model, which emphasises the development of skill through repeated practice, offers a useful framework for understanding how pragmatic speed can be enhanced. This study set to examine the impact of an ACT-R based form of instruction, input-based practice, on the development of pragmatic recognition and oral production of English refusals in a group of Iranian English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. It compared the results from that pedagogic treatment with those from a similar group following ‘6Rs’ metapragmatic instruction, which does not include repeated activities. A total of 115 Iranian EFL students took part in the study.

Contrary to other speech acts, the speech act of offering advice has not been sufficiently studied and has not been a topic of cross-cultural or cross-linguistic research either, particularly among Kurdish EFL learners. The study aimed to conduct a comparative analysis of the advice speech act as expressed by Kurdish EFL learners and native English speakers. Thus, the study looked at the proficiency of Kurdish EFL users in selecting appropriate pragmatic expressions during the act of providing advice and discernible differences between male and female learners regarding the degree of (in)directness while advice is offered. Hence, the study included 82 undergraduate students from various universities in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, particularly in Erbil. This group consisted of 42 females and 40 males, all majoring in English Language Teaching. Additionally, 30 native English speakers also took part in the research. Data collection was conducted through a 12-item discourse completion test, and the collected data were subsequently subjected to analysis using SPSS. The results unveiled a significant difference between Kurdish EFL learners and native speakers. It figured out that Kurdish EFL learners are not quite aware of the social power and social distance of interlocutors while giving advice. Additionally, it was indicated that female learners are more indirect in offering advice than their male counterparts.

On the one hand, it investigates whether and to what extent any sociolinguistic view to language will be needed or should be applicable to the classroom situation, whether students indeed constitute an entity that owes much of its language success to the degree of sociability among the learners and the type of activity and interaction/interactivity that take place during the learning process. On the other hand and in parallel to this classroom investigation, although the importance of interactivity in website design is well recognized in Tunisia, the attention paid to understanding the impact of interactivity on consumers remains mixed. This study, therefore, draws a coextending analysis to understand how the interactivity of web commerce sites can influence the purchase intent of consumers through cognitive and emotional involvement to the website. The results indicate that the active control, reciprocal communication and synchronicity lead to cognitive and emotional involvement of the users. The general framework for investigation is founded both on a Pragmatic-Linguistic Perception (PLP) to language and on a Stimulus -Organism -Response (SOR) paradigm highlighting, thus, how research on the area of perceived interaction/interactivity may lead to answers to fundamental questions raised through research on teacher’s feedback, interaction and subsequent learning in class on one hand and internet users’ emotional and cognitive involvement and ultimate purchase intent on the other.",,10.9790/0837-191065360,https://doi.org/10.9790/0837-191065360,forward

Santoro Maurizio,2020.0,The Acquisition of English Anaphoric Expressions by Adult Chinese Speakers,"The present study has investigated the occurrence of the English anaphoric expressions, he/she, in L2 grammars. Adult Chinese learners of English were evaluated on whether they were able to provide a correct semantic interpretation of these pronouns when they appeared in complex sentences (subordinate + matrix) and correlative structures. Results have shown that L2 learners did not encounter any major difficulties in identifying the appropriate antecedents of these pronominal forms and were almost as accurate as English native speakers. This positive acquisition scenario clearly indicates that a correct reference production of English anaphors is attainable despite the visible differences between the two languages. Theoretically, it seems to support some form of Continuity in SLA; it is also consistent with the idea that internal interface phenomena are fully acquirable and are not subject to fossilization ( Interface Theory , Sorace in Biling Lang Cogn 7:143–145, 2004; Linguist Approaches Biling 1:1–33, 2011). Furthermore, L2 structures partially present in L1 grammar are attainable without necessarily relying on learners’ first language (contra Failed Functional Features Hypothesis , Hawkins and Chan in Second Lang Res 13:187–226, 1997).

The superiority of explicit pragmatic intervention over implicit treatment is confirmed overall, particularly in the teaching of the sociopragmatic features of speech acts. However, evidence suggests that such positive effects of explicit intervention are not always assured; moreover, some forms of implicit intervention are equally effective. Such variations in the findings are best explained in terms of an explicit/implicit continuum rather than a dichotomous explicit versus implicit framework. The current review also suggests that higher levels of linguistic proficiency and learner motivation may be prerequisites for maximally enhancing pragmatic teachability.",,10.1075/lllt.26.08tak,https://doi.org/10.1075/lllt.26.08tak,ancestry

In written questionnaires, we found that native speakers of French were influenced by discourse-level cues when interpreting ambiguous overt subject pronouns in French, whereas native speakers of Turkish were mainly influenced by a syntactic cue--subjecthood--when interpreting null subjects (pro) in Turkish translation equivalents. When interpreting implicit subjects of nonfinite dependent clauses (PRO), native speakers of both French and Turkish were influenced by subjecthood. Finally, Turkish learners of French were influenced by discourse-level cues in the interpretation of overt pronouns as well as PRO and showed no subject preference in either case.

Applications allowing a learner to have a conversation in a foreign language with a computer have been studied from various perspectives and under different names (dialogue systems, conversational agents, chatbots…). Considering the fragmentation of what we identify under the term dialogue-based CALL, we attempt to offer a structured overview of these efforts into a conceptual framework. Through a methodical search strategy, we collected a corpus of 343 publications. From this corpus, we formalized an operational definition of dialogue-based CALL, which allowed us to identify 96 relevant systems. Analyzing the type of dialogue they offer, on a continuum of constraints on form and meaning, we propose to classify those systems into four groups. We have called these branching, form-focused, goal-oriented and reactive systems, and we describe their corresponding interactional, instructional and technological traits. We summarize the main results from empirical studies on such systems, distinguishing observational, survey and experimental studies, and discuss the impact of dialogue-based CALL on motivation and L2 development, identifying positive evidence on both outcomes. Finally, we propose two main avenues for future research: relative effectiveness of dialogue-based CALL approaches, and dialogue systems as an environment for testing SLA hypotheses.",,10.1080/09588221.2018.1535508,https://doi.org/10.1080/09588221.2018.1535508,forward

The study found that Iranian English learners overused external modifications and underused internal modifications compared to American native speakers. However, they showed pragmatic development toward native speaker norms with increase in language proficiency level. Advanced learners approximated native speakers both in the frequency of use and linguistic form of external modifications with regard to preparator, getting pre-commitment, promise of reward, sweetener, grounder, appreciations, confirmatory, and pre-pre strategies. However they did not approximate native speakers in the frequency of use of external modifications with regard to disarmer and apology strategies, and both in frequency of use and linguistic form of imposition minimizer strategy. In addition, advanced learners approximated native speakers both in the frequency of use and linguistic form of internal modifications with regard to conditional and understater strategies; and in the linguistic form of play down, politeness marker, consultative device, and upgrader strategies. However they did not approximate native speakers both in the frequency of use and linguistic form of downtoner strategy.",,10.4304/TPLS.2.7.1387-1396,https://doi.org/10.4304/TPLS.2.7.1387-1396,forward

The participants of the study consisted of 60 upper-intermediate EFL learners majoring in English Literature and Translation who were divided into two groups: a) the explicit teaching group and b) the implicit teaching group. Accordingly, instruction on various apology situations was provided and the experimental group was asked to have e-communication through e-mail exchanges with their instructor during the semester. The study consisted of a pretest and a posttest which was considered to be quasi-experimental. The independent variable was the explicit teaching of speech acts and the dependent variable was learning success of the participants. After the treatment, the participants were given a posttest. The Analysis of the results revealed that the learners in the explicit teaching group who participated in e-mail exchanges gained significantly in terms of pragmatic proficiency required for strategies of apology. And the use of explicit teaching of apology involving them in e-communication exchanges significantly enhanced the pragmatic awareness of Persian EFL learners.",,10.5861/IJRSLL.2014.661,https://doi.org/10.5861/IJRSLL.2014.661,ancestry

Two self-paced reading experiments in the moving window paradigm were conducted to test the effects of syntax, semantics and discourse in native Japanese and native English speakers' processing of scrambled Japanese sentences. The first experiment examined how the syntactic factor (NP order) and semantic factor (NP animacy) affect processing of Japanese sentences. Results revealed that animacy difference between the subject-NP and object-NP contributes more to native English speakers' processing than default SOV word order, whereas no such difference was found for native Japanese speakers. The second experiment examined the discourse effect in processing of scrambled OSV sentences.

To address this question we conducted a self-paced reading experiment in Japanese, a language which morphologically marks both subjects and topics overtly. Our results show that both repeated-name topic-subject anaphors and repeated-name non-topic-subject anaphors exhibit the RNP and that both overt-pronoun topic-subject and overt-pronoun non-topic-subject anaphors show the OPP. However, a detailed examination of performance revealed an interaction between the anaphor topic marking, reference form, and the antecedent's grammatical status, indicating that the effect of the antecedent's grammatical status is strongest for null pronoun and repeated name subject anaphors and that the overt form most similar to null pronouns is the repeated name topic anaphor.

The development of students’ sociolinguistic competence not on ly relies on their interaction with other language users, but also their interaction with materials and resources that include aspects of sociolinguistic competence. ESL instructors need to not only choose appropriate teaching resources for the development of students’ sociolinguistic competence, but also utilise them effectively in the language classroom. This study explores how ESL instructors utilise teaching resources for the development of students’ sociolinguistic competence in the language classroom. In-depth interviews and stimulated recalls were employed in gathering data from three chosen ESL instructors from one institution. The findings reveal that these ESL instructors used alternative teaching resources to manage the lack of available resources and considered students’ needs when utilising the teaching resources in the classroom. Based on the findings, it could be concluded that ESL instructors not only need to adapt and improvise their lessons to utilise teaching resources which are suitable fo r second language learners, but also cater to their students’ needs to motivate them for further development of their sociolinguistic competence outside the language classroom. ESL instructors can use the findings from this study as a guide for the development of their students’ sociolinguistic competence through the use of teaching resources, and further research could be done on this topic, specifically focusing on the development of teaching resources emphasising on sociolinguistic competence.",,10.6007/ijarbss/v12-i5/13217,https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v12-i5/13217,forward
"Slabakova, Roumyana",2018.0,L2 semantics from a formal linguistic perspective,"Ever since Aristotle and Plato (The Categories; Cratylus), linguists have considered language to be the pairing of form (sounds or gestures or written strings) and meaning. This is true for all meaningful linguistic units from morphemes, through words, phrases and sentences, to discourse. Generally speaking, semantics is the study of how form and meaning are related. However, semantics is more narrowly construed as excluding those meanings that derive from speaker intensions and psychological states, as well as sociocultural features of the context. Furthermore, the boundary between semantics proper and pragmatics is intensely debated and to some researchers constitutes an empirical question. Formal semantics came into being as a system describing formal languages, that is, the mathematical and logical languages of computing machines as opposed to the natural languages of human beings. However, in the late 1960s the philosopher Richard Montague argued that natural languages such as English could be fruitfully described using the same rigorous rules and correspondences utilized in the description of formal languages.

In the present study, we attempt to develop EFL learners’ metapragmatic awareness of English compliments, which still remains an under-researched issue. Initially, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with intermediate-level Iranian EFL learners, Persian and British English native speakers. Although the analysis of the language learners’ realization of compliments and responses to compliments seemed to indicate that their pragmatic development was overall adequate, it also suggested the influence of the native socio-pragmatic schema on their pragmatic performance. We therefore undertook a pragmatic instruction aimed at developing the EFL learners’ metapragmatic awareness of complimenting. The results suggested that through discussion, analysis, small-scale research, and reflections on the native and target pragmalinguistic and socio-pragmatic complimenting conventions the learners were developing metapragmatic awareness.

With the assumption that learners in both settings are driven by their L1 speech norms (L1 interference), the researcher tried to explain learners’ English language performance both pragmalinguistically, in regards to the level of indirectness and types of modification, and sociopragmatically, in regards to the impact of social parameters (status, distance and degree of imposition) on the level of indirectness and amount of modification. Since English and Arabic are distinct linguistically and culturally, the researcher tried to explain the extent of such influence with reference to language learning in both settings. The study was carried out at Al-Quds Open University (QOU) and the Arab American University (AAUJ) in Palestine. Discourse completion task (DCT) was used to collect relevant data, which were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings suggested that while QOU learners approximate L1 requesting norms pragmalinguistically and socipragmaically, AAUJ learners tend to play it safe through preference for norms that are less face threatening and more conforming to the English language traditions. The differences between the request performance of both groups of L2 learners could be attributed to the different methods of instruction and language learning policies at both universities.

Syamimi Turiman,2020.0,Use of Discourse Marker ‘so’ in the Malaysian ESL Job Interviews,"The discourse marker ‘so’ has been identified as being typically high in spoken discourse, but previous studies have been focusing on its use in the oral production of native speakers. This paper explores the use of ‘so’, concentrating on job interview speech in the Malaysian English as a Second Language (ESL) context. It aims to explicate the multifunctional uses of ‘so’ in a self-developed corpus made up of 16 actual job interviews conducted in English, comprising job interviews in two different organizations in Malaysia. In the corpus, ‘so’ is identified as the tenth most frequent word, which also makes it the most-used discourse marker in the job interview speech. The results suggest that ‘so’ in the corpus serves five main functions, namely 1) to introduce summary; 2) to continue previous speaker’s topic; 3) to mark sequential relations; 4) to hold the floor; and 5) to introduce elaboration to justify a prior statement. Interestingly, when ‘so’ is used in turn-initials, it points to a specific function which is 6) to introduce new information. However, it was also found that the high frequency of ‘so’ in the corpus is associated with ‘pseudo-bridging’ whereby ‘so’ is simply used to 7) add new information and making speech seem coherent. The study implies that the teaching of discourse markers in speech, specifically the use of ‘so’ should focus more on the pragmatic functions than on semantic meanings per se, to avoid the inappropriate or overuse of this particular linguistic element.",,10.15282/IJLEAL.V10.4212,https://doi.org/10.15282/IJLEAL.V10.4212,forward

Participants included 91 English-speaking adults enrolled in fourth-semester college Spanish courses, assigned to the EI + IF group (n = 36), the IF group (n = 30), or the control group (n = 25). The EI + IF group was provided with EI on the function and use of discourse markers. This group also received a flood of input containing the target forms. Students were provided with communicative practice and feedback. In contrast, the IF group did not receive EI + IF on the use of discourse markers. This group received the same flood of input as the EI group. The IF group was presented with communicative practice although there was no feedback. Results of a speaking task administered as a pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test indicated that both treatments had a positive effect on students’ use of discourse markers. Discourse transcripts show that the EI + IF group used more discourse markers to shape their output in student— student communicative exchanges than the IF group. Taken together, results suggest that the combined effect of EI and IF was not superior to IF alone in promoting student use of discourse markers as measured on the post-test speaking tasks.",,10.1177/1362168810388694,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362168810388694,ancestry

T. K. Nguyen,2013.0,Instructional effects on the acquisition of modifiers in constructive criticism by EFL learners,"Previous research has shown that learners of English might experience considerable difficulty when giving constructive criticism to peers in instructional settings. Unlike native speakers, they tend to soften their criticism far less frequently while aggravating it far more often, and thus require pedagogical help in this area. The present study examines whether meta-pragmatic instruction facilitates the learning of linguistic resources for softening constructive criticism in an instructed language-learning context. Fifty Vietnamese high-intermediate-level students of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) were recruited for the control and treatment conditions. Over a period of 10 weeks, the treatment group received explicit instruction in eight types of criticism modifiers while the control group did not receive any equivalent instruction. For data collection, the two groups participated in discourse completion tasks, role plays, and oral peer feedback tasks before and after the treatment. The treatment group was also engaged in writing reflective journals, which were later collected and analysed for instances of input noticing. A delayed posttest was conducted for the treatment group five weeks after the experiment in order to investigate whether instructional effects (if any) lasted beyond immediate post-experimental observations. Findings show positive instructional effects on learners’ pragmatic performance and are discussed with implications for future research.",,10.1080/09658416.2012.658810,https://doi.org/10.1080/09658416.2012.658810,ancestry

The present study examines whether giving corrective feedback on students’ performance during pragmatics-focused activities leads to their subsequent improvement in producing and recognising pragmatically appropriate email requests in the above context. Two intact classes of Vietnamese EFL (English as a foreign language) intermediate level students were randomly assigned to either direct-feedback condition or meta-pragmatic feedback condition, but received similar explicit pragmatic pre-instruction. Another intact class was randomly selected as a control group. Students’ pragmatic performance was measured by means of a pre-test, an immediate and delayed post-tests, which consisted of a production and a recognition task. The results indicate that the treatment groups performed significantly better than the control group in the production task, but there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. On the other hand, students who received meta-pragmatic feedback significantly outperformed those receiving direct feedback and the control group in the recognition task.

T. Sydorenko,2015.0,The use of computer-delivered structured tasks in pragmatic instruction: An exploratory study,"Abstract This study examines the effect of oral practice via computer-delivered structured tasks (CASTs) with native speaker (NS) models and open-ended tasks without NS input (i.e., learner-leaner role-plays) on pragmatic development of second language learners. While prior studies have indicated that structured tasks afford more opportunities for focus on form (FonF) than open-ended tasks (Lee and VanPatten 2003; Lyster 2004; Ranta and Lyster 2007; Skehan and Foster 1999; Tavakoli and Foster 2011), differences between these tasks in pragmatic instruction (PI) have not been examined. Additionally, the effect of practice has been widely examined with regard to oral development, but much less so for pragmatics (e.g., Li 2013; Takimoto 2012a). In this study, one group of ESL learners practiced request speech acts via CASTs, and another group did so via learner-learner open role-plays. Qualitative analysis of participants’ output during practice suggests that rehearsal via CASTs promotes FonF and incorporation of NS models into learners’ speech, while rehearsal via role-plays results in more creative, but often pragmatically inappropriate, language and content. Additionally, role-plays, but not CASTs, appear to be conducive to humorous language play, metapragmatic discussions, and extended turns similar to those in naturalistic interactions. The study offers insights regarding task types in PI.",,10.1515/ip-2015-0017,https://doi.org/10.1515/ip-2015-0017,forward

Twelve highly proficient learners of English completed six simulated conversations focused on making requests in academic contexts. Evidence of learning was examined microgenetically by comparing data across the simulated conversations and triangulated by written reflections, surveys, and interviews. Results showed that participants gained content and linguistic forms from expert speaker models, and their interactions in scenario-based simulations indicated greater pragmatic awareness and changes in oral production over time.

"Taguchi, Naoko",2011.0,"Do proficiency and study-abroad experience affect speech act production? Analysis of appropriateness, accuracy, and fluency","Findings generally confirmed that accuracy and fluency form distinct dimensions of pragmatic competence and do not develop in parallel. Because Taguchi (2007) is the only existing study that examined the proficiency effect in fluent speech act production, as measured by speech rate and planning time, and very little research has examined the effect of study-abroad on pragmatic fluency, more research is needed to fill die gap in me literature. [...]it seems that linguistic sophistication is a prerequisite for a successful high-imposition speech act; as a result, learners of higher proficiency demonstrated superior performance in accuracy and appropriateness of this type of speech act than the lower proficiency group. Different from pre-task planning speed, speech rate seems to more closely reflect one's overall proficiency and corresponding efficiency in dealing with linguistic resources. Because learners had to translate their pragmatic intentions into language rapidly and smoothly under the temporal constraints of on-line processing, general proficiency, which is a reflection of overall linguistic management skill and language-related experience, is likely to play a role in promoting speech rate. Because speech rate measured as words per minute is not sensitive to the nature of speech that often involves multi-word lexical chunks, future research should apply a wider range of oral fluency measures to confirm the generalizability of the present findings.", General Information,10.1515/iral.2011.015,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/do-proficiency-study-abroad-experience-affect/docview/916631990/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
"Taguchi, Naoko",2011.0,Teaching Pragmatics: Trends and Issues,"Theoretical, empirical, and practical interest in pragmatic competence and development for second language (L2) learners has resulted in a large body of literature on teaching L2 pragmatics. This body of literature has diverged into two major domains: (a) a group of experimental studies directly testing the efficacy of various instructional methods in pragmatics learning and (b) research that explores optimal instructional practice and resources for pragmatic development in formal classroom settings. This article reviews literature in these two domains and aims at providing a collective view of the available options for pragmatics teaching and the ways that pragmatic development can best be promoted in the classroom. In the area of instructional intervention, this article reviews studies under the common theoretical second language acquisition paradigms of explicit versus implicit instruction, input processing instruction, and skill acquisition and practice. In the area of classroom practice and resources, three domains of research and pedagogical practices are reviewed: material development and teacher education, learner strategies and autonomous learning, and incidental pragmatics learning in the classroom. Finally, this article discusses unique challenges and opportunities that have been embraced by pragmatics teaching in the current era of poststructuralism and multiculturalism.

"Taguchi, Naoko",2018.0,Contexts and pragmatics learning: Problems and opportunities of the study abroad research,"Despite different epistemologies and assumptions, all theories in second language (L2) acquisition emphasize the centrality of context in understanding L2 acquisition. Under the assumption that language emerges from use in context, the cognitivist approach focuses on distributions and properties of input to infer both learning objects and process of acquisition. The interactionist approach views context more narrowly by analyzing how a particular linguistic item is attended and processed during a task-based interaction, and how it becomes intake as learning outcomes. For socially-oriented theories such as the sociocultural theory and language socialization, learning is fundamentally situated in context. Through mediated participation in learning as social practice, learners come to appropriate linguistic knowledge. Context is also fundamental in the complex, dynamic systems theory, which views learning as a non-linear, adaptive process emerging through an interaction of resources and individuals within a given context. All of these theories give the central power to context to describe and explain L2 learning. Context serves as the site where acquisition is examined. Context also helps explain the process and outcomes of acquisition.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0261444815000440,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/contexts-pragmatics-learning-problems/docview/1976618318/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Taguchi, Naoko;Gomez-Laich, Maria Pia;Arrufat-Marques, Maria-Jose",2016.0,Comprehension of Indirect Meaning in Spanish as a Foreign Language,"This study investigated comprehension of indirect meaning among learners of L2 Spanish via an original computer-delivered multimedia listening test. The comprehension of implied speaker intention is a type of indirect communication that involves the ability to understand implied intention by using linguistic knowledge, contextual cues, and the assumption of relevance (Taguchi, 2005, 2011). Since inferential processing involves parallel processing of all available signals, both linguistic and nonlinguistic, to interpret the indirect utterance (Sperber &amp; Wilson, 1995), it is essential to incorporate multimedia input. By creating a multimedia comprehension test in Spanish, the study examined theoretical claims about inferential mechanisms and their applicability to L2 comprehension. Thirty-two L2 Spanish learners in intermediate/ advanced Spanish classes at a private U.S. university and 21 native Spanish speakers completed a listening test that assessed comprehension of three types of indirect meaning: indirect refusals, indirect opinions, and irony. These item types differed in terms of the degree of conventionality encoded and the extent of inferencing required for comprehension. Participants' comprehension was analyzed for accuracy and comprehension speed. Results revealed a significant difference in L2 Spanish learners' comprehension accuracy scores and response times across the three item types. Irony was the most difficult to comprehend for L2 Spanish learners. Conventionality did not facilitate comprehension because indirect refusals and opinions had the same accuracy scores. In terms of response times, indirect opinions were faster to comprehend than indirect refusals and irony items. Posthoc retrospective verbal interviews revealed that learners used a wide a range of verbal, nonverbal, and contextual cues to make inferences of indirect meaning.", Journal Article,10.Un/flan.12230,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/comprehension-indirect-meaning-spanish-as-foreign/docview/1855294464/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

The data was collected from 150 Pakistani Urdu speakers (teachers, doctors, army personals, lawyers, journalists and academicians) working in different institutions and 30 British English speakers (faculty members of English Department, Coventry University, UK, Leeds University, UK and British Association of Applied Linguistics members). The findings reveal that Pakistanis are found using more positive face threatening apology responses (Acceptance and Acknowledgment) including Absolution, Dismissal, Intensifiers, and Acknowledgement with Thanking, Advice, and Suggestion, than British speakers who tend to use both positive FTAs (Acceptance) based on Absolution “That’s Okay”, and Dismissal “no worries at all but be careful next time” and negative FTAs based on Evasion with Deflection and Evasion with Thanking. The findings further illustrate that the understanding and demonstration of politeness and face in conversation functions are susceptible to cultural and sociolinguistic variations.",,10.5539/ijel.v8n5p71,https://doi.org/10.5539/ijel.v8n5p71,forward
Tahnee Bucher Barbosa da Silva,2012.0,Bringing Pragmatics into the ESL Classroom,"Bringing Pragmatics into the ESL Classroom Tahnee Bucher Barbosa da Silva As a result of the expanding interest in the cognitive and social dimensions of language use beyond single sentences, a great number of research studies have been conducted in order to examine nonnative speakers’ ability to use language appropriately in a social context. Recently, with a growing understanding of the key role pragmatic competence plays in second language development, researchers have also investigated the benefits of direct instruction in helping language learners become aware of the pragmatic conditions governing the uses of grammatical structures. This thesis reports on the design and administration of a study that investigated language learners’ knowledge of pragmatics and how instruction can help them develop this knowledge in an environment where English is taught as a second language. Specifically, this project had two aims: (1) to observe the relationship between language proficiency and pragmatic competence of learners of English as a Second Language (ESL), and (2) to examine whether instruction was effective in improving those learners’ pragmatic knowledge. Pragmatic competence was measured quantitatively, through discourse judgment tasks, multiple-choice discourse completion tasks (MDCTs) and written discourse completion tasks (WDCTs) in a pre-, post-, and delayed post-test, designed specifically for this study. The participants in this research, thirty-nine adult ESL learners with a range of proficiency studying in the Intensive English Program (IEP) and in a university-level English course at West Virginia University, first took a language proficiency test and a pre-test on pragmatic knowledge. The participants were then assigned into two groups, experimental and comparison. The experimental group received four hours of direct instruction in five types of speech acts (requests, refusals, apologies, compliments, suggestions) and other aspects of pragmatic knowledge over a period of two weeks, while the comparison group was taught lessons on other topics without intervention during the same amount of time. An immediate post-test on pragmatic knowledge and a delayed post-test were given to both groups. The results showed that language proficiency and pragmatic knowledge were positively correlated with a moderate strength (r = .71, p < .001). Analysis of covariance and further analysis showed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the comparison group in both the post-test and delayed post-test. The experimental group benefited from the instruction, which used a blended methodological approach, and the instructional effect was retained after a one-week delay. The results of this research helped understand the communicative skills and intercultural competence of ESL learners and demonstrated that instruction in the area of pragmatics is not only important but it can be beneficial at all levels of language proficiency. It is hoped that the topics reported and discussed here and the findings may help both English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and ESL teachers gain a better understanding of second language learners’ pragmatic competence and development through instruction, so that when they incorporate pragmatics instruction into their teaching, they will be in a better position to adapt their practices to facilitate pragmatic development.",,10.33915/etd.316,https://doi.org/10.33915/etd.316,forward

The scholarly evidence seemingly indicates that both L2 learners of English and Japanese can acquire and adopt pragmatically correct refusal and indirect opinion utterances and strategies, either through explicit instruction, or incidentally through target language (TL) immersion environments. Nevertheless, advanced levels of general TL language proficiency do not always appear to correlate to corresponding levels of pragmatic competence or fluency in the specific areas examined. In fact, pragmatically appropriate speech patterns may often be inconsistently adopted due to a variety of factors, which may point to a greater need for explicit pragmatics instruction in TL classroom environments.",,10.22492/issn.2435-7030.2020.4,https://doi.org/10.22492/issn.2435-7030.2020.4,forward

Discourse analysis techniques and quantitative data analysis were used to explore how 52 learners expressed alignment and changes in participation patterns in two sets of instructional peer-to-peer conversations. The results of the analyses show that, although subject to great individual variability and not always following native-like standards, English native speakers in the early stages of learning Spanish are able to express varying degrees of alignment in conversations with a peer of a similar proficiency level. As they strive to create a sphere of mutual understanding, they test different options from their linguistic repertoire and learn not only from their own attempts but also from those of their interlocutor. These results suggest that repeated engagement in interactional practice does provide the linguistic, social, and pedagogical affordances learners need to develop the interactional skills that will serve them well not only to build confidence and competence in the classroom learning context, but also hopefully in the world outside the classroom.", Journal Article,10.1111/flan.12177,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/beginning-learners-development-interactional/docview/1783692885/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

"Tiefu Zhang, Xuemei Chen, Jiehui Hu, Pattarapon Ketwan",2021.0,"EFL Students' Preferences for Written Corrective Feedback: Do Error Types, Language Proficiency, and Foreign Language Enjoyment Matter?","Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study investigated the preference of learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) for four types of written corrective feedback (WCF), which are often discussed in the literature, on grammatical, lexical, orthographic, and pragmatic errors. In particular, it concerned whether such preference is influenced by two learner variables, namely, foreign language enjoyment (FLE) and proficiency level. The preference for selective vs. comprehensive WCF was also examined. The participants in the study were 117 University students in a Thai EFL context. Analysis of questionnaire data revealed a tendency for learners to prefer more explicit types of WCF (i.e., metalinguistic explanation and overt correction) for most error types, irrespective of their proficiency and FLE level. High proficiency level learners rated less explicit WCF types (i.e., underlining and error code) as useful to some degree, whereas their low proficiency level counterparts did not. Similar results were found for the two FLE groups. Besides, the FLE level seemed to play a role in perceiving the value of WCF in terms of scope. The results of follow-up interviews showed that the linguistic features of learners' first language, existing knowledge of the target language, affective feelings, and teacher's role were the main factors contributing to variation in learners' preferences. Possible pedagogical implications are discussed.",,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.660564,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.660564,forward

Percut, Sei Tuan",2024.0,A Systematic Review of Pragmatic Competence in Second Language Acquisition,"This article presents a systematic review of pragmatic competence in second language acquisition (SLA), emphasizing its critical role in effective communication and intercultural understanding. Pragmatic competence encompasses the ability to understand and use language appropriately in diverse social and cultural contexts, including mastering speech acts, politeness strategies, conversational implicatures, and intercultural pragmatics. Despite its importance, pragmatic competence often receives less attention in language instruction compared to grammar and vocabulary. The review highlights the effectiveness of explicit and implicit teaching methods, authentic interaction, and cultural immersion in developing pragmatic skills. It also underscores the role of technology, such as digital platforms and simulations, in enhancing learners’ ability to navigate real-life communication scenarios. 
The findings reveal significant challenges, including cultural variability in pragmatic norms, difficulties in standardizing assessments, and the influence of learners’ individual differences. The study calls for innovative teaching and evaluation methods, focusing on personalized approaches and the integration of pragmatic learning with emotional intelligence. By synthesizing current research and practices, this article provides valuable insights for educators, curriculum developers, and researchers, advocating for adaptive, culturally informed, and technology-supported strategies to enhance pragmatic competence in SLA.",,10.61132/sintaksis.v3i1.1291,https://doi.org/10.61132/sintaksis.v3i1.1291,forward
"Tolentino, Leida C;Tokowicz, Natasha",2011.0,"ACROSS LANGUAGES, SPACE, AND TIME","This review examines whether similarity between the first language (L1) and second language (L2) influences the (morpho)syntactic processing of the L2, using both neural location and temporal processing information. Results from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP) studies show that nonnative speakers can exhibit nativelike online L2 (morpho)syntactic processing behavior and neural patterns. These findings are contrary to predictions of the shallow structure hypothesis for syntactic processing (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006a, 2006b). The data are in line with predictions of the (morpho)syntactic domain of the unified competition model of L2 acquisition (MacWhinney, 2005): Differences in L2 processing as compared to the L1 (or to native speakers of the L2) were generally associated with constructions that were crosslinguistically dissimilar or unique to the L2. The processing of crosslinguistically similar constructions generally produced no differences in brain activity between the L1 and L2. Overall, the available data suggest that cross-language similarity is an important factor that influences L2 (morpho)syntactic processing.

The experimental groups were introduced to a set of connective markers in two sessions. EG1 followed a task-based approach, while EG2 experienced task-supported language teaching. CG took part in regular classes that were not intended to teach connective markers. The analysis of variance showed that instruction in both experimental groups positively impacted the number and quality of connective markers used in learners' for-and-against essays, with a slight but non-significant advantage of TBLT in the delayed post-test. The study is timely in that it addresses a still inconclusive line of research on L2 pragmatics instruction, investigates the thriving area of task-based teaching, and employs the most often-used type of essay on a nationwide secondary school-leaving examination.",,10.31261/tapsla.15113,https://doi.org/10.31261/tapsla.15113,forward
"Tomita, Naoko",2013.0,Strategies for linking information by German and Japanese native Speakers and by German learners of Japanese,"In these utterances, the information from the domain of ENTITY is encoded via the grammatical subject. [...]there are two options regarding the predominance within the topic part of the propositional structure: A. 'TIME &gt; ENTITY' : by placing the temporal adverb before the subject in the clause, the speaker can give preference to a newly introduced time span over the topic entity, indicating this:15 ( 18) jetzt ist auch herr grün aus dem fenster gesprungen. For segment 28, 9 of 20 Japanese speakers do not mention the event of fire, and 6 of these 9 speakers employ the adverbial 'still' in order to relate the information [Mr. Red's not-jumping] (segment 28) to the same information asserted for a previous span of time (segment 25). [...]it seems that the speaker - probably regardless of his/her language - could easily recognize the 'still'-relation between segment 25 and 28, if the interjacent event of fire is not involved in the retelling. In linking information concerning the main characters, the Japanese speakers typically organize a shift-in-ENTlTY with the additive particle -mo in order to mark that the same comment applies for different topic entities (analysis unit 1 ). [...]the comparisons invite the expectation that a parallel event to an event that already occurred in relation to one character will happen to another topic entity; its realization is then marked by the temporal adverb yooyaku 'finally (-(-expectation)' in sentence initial position and by the additive particle -mo 'also' (as in [23]). Complemented by the present author. 6.

Tongqing Gu,2014.0,Pragmatic Development of Chinese EFL Learners-A Study on FL Suggestions,"While the number of studies on the pragmatic development of nonnative English speakers has been increasing, surprisingly little research has been conducted on the development of the ability of foreign language learners to perform the suggestion speech act, with even less taking Chinese EFL learners as the target group. The present study examines the development of Chinese EFL learners’ pragmatic competence by investigating their performance of the suggestion speech act over time. Three sub-corpora representing three different periods of Chinese EFL learners’ performance were selected from the SECCL (Spoken English Corpus of Chinese Learners) to discover the changes in the use of linguistic formulae as well as suggestion strategies by Chinese EFL learners. Their performance was then compared with that of native English speakers to find out whether there was evidence of improvement across the years. The results show that (1) changes were taking place in the use of linguistic formulae and suggestion strategies by Chinese learners from 1997 to 2003, with greater changes taking place from the year 2000 to 2003, and (2) there was evidence of increasing similarity between Chinese learners’ performance of the suggestion speech acts and that of native English speakers. It can thus be concluded that Chinese learners’ pragmatic ability in English improved to some extent over the years of the study.",,10.5539/ELT.V7N4P147,https://doi.org/10.5539/ELT.V7N4P147,forward
"Tracey M. Derwing, Erin Waugh, M. Munro",2021.0,Pragmatically speaking,"
The relationship between second language (L2) comprehensibility and pragmatics is explored in two experiments involving instruction of speech acts to learners enrolled in a Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada program. The study was designed to determine whether improved pragmatic competence results in enhanced comprehensibility (how easy L2 speech is to understand). Two intact classes participated; one received 25 hours of pragmatics instruction, while the control group received the standard curriculum (no focus on pragmatics). Both classes were recorded in role-plays based on several scenarios at pre- and post-test. Transcriptions of the role-plays were coded according to a rubric; although the control group showed superior performance at the outset, the experimental group’s scores exceeded those of the Control group at post-test with a medium effect size. A subset of pre- and posttest role-plays (two refusals and two requests) were randomly assigned to 56 native English listeners who rated the speech samples for social appropriateness, comprehensibility, and fluency. The experimental group’s posttest productions on all scenarios were perceived as significantly more socially appropriate, with three scenarios showing significant improvement in comprehensibility. Although one scenario improved in fluency, another showed a decline. The results suggest that pragmatics instruction enhances L2 speech comprehensibility.",,10.1075/AP.20001.DER,https://doi.org/10.1075/AP.20001.DER,forward

"Tsuchiya, Shinsuke",2020.0,The native speaker fallacy in a U.S. university Japanese and Chinese program,"Informed by concepts of native speakers, racial nativism, and language socialization theory, this study documented the existence of the native speaker fallacy (Phillipson, 1992, Linguistic imperialism. Oxford: Oxford University Press) in a university-level Japanese and Chinese program in the United States. Specifically, the researcher collected survey responses from language teachers and students, conducted interviews, and observed the teacher training process, one-on-one teaching sessions, and classroom teaching over the course of 2 academic years. A regression analysis showed how the perception of native and non-native speakers was significantly influenced by students' language level, native language, and race, and by the language program itself. The cases of a dialectal speaker and biracial Japanese teachers illustrated the effects of the bifurcated categorizations on teachers who do not fit in the dichotomy. Implications derived from this study call for critical analysis of the valorization of standard dialect and investigation into ways that will make more room for diversity in the language classroom. This study also underscores the importance of debriefing meetings that allow language professionals and students to reflect their teaching and learning experiences in relation to their identities and to examine unquestioned assumptions about language and racial identities and language standardization in increasingly globalized and diverse communities.", Journal Article,10.1111/flan.12475,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/native-speaker-fallacy-u-s-university-japanese/docview/2497229996/se-2?accountid=9902,llba

Tsui-Ping Cheng,2016.0,Authentic L2 interactions as material for a pragmatic awareness-raising activity,"ABSTRACT This study draws on conversation analysis to explore the pedagogical possibility of using audiovisual depictions of authentic disagreement sequences from L2 interactions as sources for an awareness-raising activity in an English as a Second Language (ESL) classroom. Video excerpts of disagreement sequences collected from two ESL classes were used to examine how the participating ESL students understand and respond to the natural L2 interactions in small group discussions. The analyses show that the students use their auditory and visual access to the authentic sequences in the audiovisual input to analyse and evaluate the targeted speech act: (1) they draw on the video excerpts' rich contextual information to engage in similar situational contexts and develop an affiliative understanding of the pragmatic practices used; (2) they compare different disagreement practices, make informed decisions regarding their pragmatic options, and even search for justifications for their choices; and (3) they monitor the vocal and visual conduct surrounding the focal action and utilise their observations to justify their assessments of the pragmatic practice. Therefore, using video recordings and conversion-analysis-informed transcripts of authentic interactions bears clear pedagogical value by enhancing L2 speakers' awareness of contextual factors around speech act sequences, their pragmatic choices, and the multimodal character of pragmatic actions.",,10.1080/09658416.2016.1154568,https://doi.org/10.1080/09658416.2016.1154568,forward

Method: The participants included two groups of learners of Mandarin (23 English speakers, 18 Japanese speakers), two groups of nonleamers of Mandarin (24 English speakers, 21 Japanese speakers), and a control group of 10 Mandarin speakers. A four-alternative forced-choice discrimination task that included 360 trials was presented in three blocks of 120 trials. Results: The native Mandarin group was more accurate in their tonal discrimination of all six tone pairs than all the nonnative groups. While Japanese nonlearners generally outperformed English nonlearners in their overall perception of Mandarin lexical tones, L1-based differences were less extensive for the two groups of learners. Both learner groups were least accurate on T2-T3 and most accurate on T3-T4.

The reflexive zibun allows both local and long-distance (LD) binding interpretations. In a recent analysis, zibun is categorized into three types: zibun bound locally by a co-argument, zibun bound by an empathic LD antecedent, and zibun bound by a logophoric LD antecedent. An empathic antecedent is the participant in a sentence that the speaker most empathizes with, whereas, a logophoric antecedent is an individual “whose speech, thoughts, feelings, or general state of consciousness are reported” (Clements, 1975). Chinese also has a reflexive, ziji (self), that can be bound by an LD antecedent, like Japanese zibun . However, Chinese ziji is categorized into two (not three) types: locally bound ziji and ziji bound by a logophoric LD antecedent (Huang, Li &amp; Li, 2009). The goal of this study is to determine whether Chinese-speaking learners are able to distinguish the two different types of LD antecedent for zibun in Japanese.

The content analysis results indicate that the performance changes originated mainly from the instruction and illuminate the share of the filmic materials as the innovative component there. On account of these, with its epistemological approach enabling triangulation, the study contributes to instructional pragmatics by providing an exemplary practice of quality assurance in teaching implicature comprehension/interpretation.",,10.29333/AJQR/10973,https://doi.org/10.29333/AJQR/10973,forward

Furthermore, using retrospective verbal reports, this study discusses whether participants’ engagement in the design of the role-play task encouraged them to act out the situations, as they would do it in real-life contexts. The study evidences the usefulness of adopting a learner-centred approach to design the role-play task.

The tool will primarily endeavor to support pragmatics learning within the language use domain “workplace.” Given this superordinate objective, this paper is subdivided into 2 parts. In the first section, we provide a detailed overview of previous (empirical) research, theories, and frameworks of communicative competence to review the role of pragmatics as an essential component of L2 communicative language ability. A principled, systematic, and exhaustive literature search was conducted via key word searches, and the selected literature was categorized and coded using NVivo 10 software. Next, 12 distinct models of communicative language ability that contain components of pragmatic knowledge were identified and analyzed. The commonly identified constitutive components were then reconceptualized into a proposed construct of pragmatic competence. The challenges of operationalizing pragmatic competence in both instruction and assessment are discussed. The second part of the paper constitutes a domain analysis of pragmatics in the language use domain “workplace.” First, the literature is reviewed for communicative tasks and activities that feature prominently in different workplace settings across various English-speaking countries. Then, we suggest and exemplify different model task types that can be employed in the context of learning and assessment materials that aim to foster pragmatic-functional awareness in both English as a foreign language (EFL)/English as a second language (ESL) learners and first language (L1) speakers alike.",,10.1002/ETS2.12053,https://doi.org/10.1002/ETS2.12053,forward

Vahid Rafieyan,2016.0,Bridging Pragmatic Gap in Translation Process through Developing Pragmatic Awareness,"In order for the translator to be able to translate the source text into the target language in a relevant way, the strata of the translated text through which relevance can be obtained (pragmatic, pragmatic-semantic, and semantic strata) should be equalized to that of the source text (Li & Luo, 2004). The translator can achieve this by raising his/her awareness of the source and target language pragmatic perspectives. To investigate the actual effect of developing knowledge of pragmatic perspectives of the source language and the target language on the quality of translation of culture-bound texts, the current study was conducted on 64 Iranian undergraduate students of English translation. The study consisted of three phases: 1) administering a culture-bound text to be translated by all participants, 2) dividing participants into two groups: one merely receiving translation exercises while the other receiving metapragmatic discussions of the pragmatic perspectives of the source language along with translation exercises, and 3) assessing the translation quality of both groups immediately and two months following the treatment.

"Vahid Rafieyan, W. Rozycki",2018.0,Production and Comprehension Aspects of Pragmatic Competence in an Immersive Language Program,"Since pragmatic ability appears to be a vital skill for social transactions, Bardovi-Harlig and Mahan-Taylor (2003) have argued for the inclusion of explicit instruction in pragmatics within general language instruction. However, their study adopts a speech-act framework that does not differentiate between pragmatic production and pragmatic comprehension . L1 learners develop a comprehension stage before producing appropriate utterances (Berk, 2012), and it may be that L2 learners do likewise. To advance pedagogy, this paper addresses four research questions within the context of a residential, immersive language program in an EFL setting: 1) Is there any relationship between language proficiency and the production aspect of pragmatic competence? 2) Is there any relationship between language proficiency and the comprehension aspect of pragmatic competence? 3) To what extent does an immersive language program lead to the development of the production aspect of pragmatic competence? and 4) To what extent does an immersive language program lead to the development of the comprehension aspect of pragmatic competence? Japanese first-year college students (n=30) were assessed through three instruments at the start of a one-year language immersion program: TOEFL PBT; a 32-item pragmatic production test (Bardovi-Harlig, 2009); and a 58-item pragmatic comprehension test (Taguchi, 2007, 2008, 2012). The correlation between language proficiency and pragmatic production, as well as between language proficiency and pragmatic comprehension, was computed through Pearson correlation coefficient. Fifteen of the subjects thereupon participated in an intensive language program. At the end of the academic year, all 15 subjects took the pragmatic production and comprehension tests again (post-tests). The findings of the one-year longitudinal study on the efficacy of language instruction in an immersive language program, and its relation to both production and comprehension aspects of pragmatic competence, is demonstrated. Language proficiency had a positive correlation with gains in both pragmatic production and pragmatic comprehension. Also, language instruction, even without specifically addressing pragmatic instruction, had a significant effect on developing both pragmatic production and pragmatic comprehension.",,10.3968/10542,https://doi.org/10.3968/10542,forward

We present the findings of a study on the acquisition of two properties of Japanese, head-final word order and case marking, by naïve learners of Japanese as a L2 who had no prior knowledge of this language or any other head-final, case-marking language. Participants underwent an input treatment in which they heard and saw basic subject-object-verb sentences in Japanese and were subsequently tested on these basic sentences and also on sentences to which they were not exposed during the treatment (i.e., polar questions and embedded clauses). Reading times on grammatical and ungrammatical sentences served as measures of underlying sensitivity to violations of grammatical word order for both the basic sentences and the novel sentences. Our results yielded three groups of learners: those who showed sensitivity to violations of basic word order, polar questions, and embedded clauses (parameter reset); those who showed sensitivity to violations of basic word order and polar questions only (partial parameter reset); and those who showed sensitivity to violations of basic word order only (no parameter reset). Because our measure of aptitude as grammatical sensitivity did not emerge as a factor distinguishing the three groups from one another, we argue that this component of aptitude is not a factor in whether learners are able to reset parameters. We also found that all participants, regardless of group, demonstrated sensitivity to case-marking violations, suggesting that aptitude as grammatical sensitivity plays no role in the acquisition of underlying features related to case or to the surface-level markings of case in Japanese.", Journal Article,10.1017/S0272263114000345,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/aptitude-as-grammatical-sensitivity-initial/docview/1655478638/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
Veronika Timpe-Laughlin,2016.0,Learning and Development of Second and Foreign Language Pragmatics as a Higher‐Order Language Skill: A Brief Overview of Relevant Theories,"The development of effective second and foreign (L2) language learning materials needs to be grounded in two types of theories: (a) a theory of language and language use and (b) a theory of language learning. Both are equally important, insofar as an effective learning environment requires an understanding of the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are being targeted as well as an idea of how learner development progresses. Although the author and colleagues have previously provided a theoretical basis for the construct of L2 pragmatic ability, and thus a theory of language use, the current paper focuses on learner development, particularly on the theoretical orientation towards L2 pragmatic learning. Given this superordinate goal, the paper will briefly review different theoretical paradigms that have been employed in adult L2 pragmatics development research. In the first part of the paper, I will provide an overview of the cognitive, socially oriented, and emergentist perspectives used in research on L2 pragmatic development. Then, based on the different ontological perspectives, I will discuss the affordances and challenges of applying a theoretical perspective to designing L2 pragmatic learning environments, drawing upon the example of the cognitively oriented information processing theory.",,10.1002/ETS2.12124,https://doi.org/10.1002/ETS2.12124,forward

While the majority of second/foreign language (L2) pragmatics tests have targeted productive skills, the assessment of receptive pragmatic skills remains a developing field. This study explores validation evidence for a test of receptive L2 pragmatic ability called the American English Sociopragmatic Comprehension Test (AESCT), which is a Web-based assessment consisting of 54 tasks measuring knowledge of speech acts, routine formulae, and culture-dependent lexical differences. The AESCT is intended to be used as a learning-oriented assessment in university-level applied linguistics classes. This study collected evidence on construct validity supporting the AESCT design as a measure of pragmatic comprehension and for providing feedback in low-stakes learning contexts; 97 university-level English language learners took the AESCT along with the Cambridge Placement Test and a background questionnaire on their exposure to target language input. Descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and linear regression were used to analyze aspects of construct validity. Results indicate that the AESCT is sufficiently reliable. Overall, learners were found to perform as previous research suggests: sociopragmatic knowledge was related to L2 exposure and L2 proficiency. Alongside future research into L2 pragmatics test validation, implications for instruction-oriented utilization of the AESCT are discussed.",,10.1080/15434303.2016.1256406,https://doi.org/10.1080/15434303.2016.1256406,forward

The WBT was designed to teach the speech acts of complaints and requests to Spanish language learners whose first language is English. The content in the WBT is based upon available empirical evidence at the time of development. Data were collected at pretest and posttest and the analysis employed a mixed methods approach. The results revealed that the WBT was more effective with intermediate- than with novice-level learners of Spanish. In addition, learners’ comprehension gains were greater than their production gains. In other words, learners improved in their ability to recognize appropriate pragmatic strategy use; however, they still had difficulty producing pragmatically appropriate features after completing the WBT.

To this end, the participants were randomly divided into two groups: experimental and control. A Discourse Completion Task (DCT) was conducted as pre- and post-test to determine whether flipped classroom instruction is more effective than the conventional method in providing learners with pragmatic knowledge needed to produce request speech acts successfully. Data were analysed using a paired sample t-test. The results showed that flipped classroom instruction was more effective than the other method in raising the level of pragmatic competence among the participants. The study results also revealed that the participants’ performance on request speech acts in the treatment group remarkably improved in the post-test. This is because they had a more flexible and accessible e-learning environment, which in turn, enhanced their pragmatic competence after the treatment.

Specifically, we trace the development made by a group of 30 L2 Korean learners in their understanding of the contextual meanings of Korean first-person pronouns over the provision of L1- and L2-generated input and an awareness raising activity. Our findings reveal that provision of input of the underlying stereotypical meanings facilitated learners’ (re-)construction and negotiation of contextual meanings. The learners developed from oversimplistic form-meaning connections to more context-based and internally logical interpretations of contextual meanings, constructed new contextual meanings from the input, and agentively negotiated between the input and their existing indexical systems.

Data included video-recordings of semi-structured interviews between the learners and a Chinese native speaker as well as their stimulated recalls with the recorded interviews. Sequential analysis of their use of mitigation showed that, at the beginning of their study abroad (SA), the learners used the [dànshì /kěshì] (‘but’) clause but did not use the four mitigation forms identified as common sentential mitigation devices in Chinese corpora (reduplication of verbs, verb+[yīxià], the sentence final particle [ba], and [a]/[ya]).

A mixed-methods approach was adopted. The heritage group outperformed their foreign language counterparts in terms of grammar and lexicon accuracy and in a few mitigating devices. In contrast, the foreign language group produced various forms of head acts that more closely approximated the production of Chinese native speakers. However, learner groups shared several characteristics: Underproduction of the modal verb neng, downtoners, understaters, and supportive moves, particularly in higher imposition situations, and overproduction of query preparatories and politeness expressions in lower imposition situations. The study revealed a large discrepancy between the learners’ and the NSs’ groups in pragmatically functional expressions. The learner groups under-produced these functional expressions that are less transparent in form-meaning/function connections.",,10.4324/9781351208673-3,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351208673-3,forward

The data were from thirteen native speakers, four Chinese instructors, twenty-three L2 Chinese learners, and four Chinese textbooks. Results from variation analysis with frequency description show four general patterns. First, instructors used overt forms of stylistic variants in class significantly more frequently than native speakers did in conversations. Second, learners tended to overuse the overt forms compared with their native speaker peers. Third, learner patterns of stylistic variation aligned closely with those of their teachers. Finally, unlike teacher input, textbook input demonstrated mixed results compared with learner patterns. For DE use, learners’ patterns aligned significantly with those in textbooks, but did not for subject pronoun use.

Both teachers and students agreed that CF is not only important but necessary since junior and senior students still have pronunciation problems and the best time to provide CF is soon after presentation. However, they differed in concern about students’ self-respect, the types of errors that should receive CF and preference for the types of CF. In particular, students’ eagerness to learn exceeded their concern about self-respect. Teachers turned to offer CF to repeated errors, while students would like to receive more than teachers could offer. Moreover, teachers regarded prompt as being more effective, whereas students preferred recast to prompt considering the latter to be more demanding though they held similar views about explicit correction.

"Y. Cho, J. Jung, M. Park",2013.0,Pedagogical Scenarios for Teaching Topic/Nominative Marking in Discourse,"
 Based on an error analysis of KFL learners' use of the topic marker (TM) and the nominative marker (NM), we will identify sources of common errors, define their semantically accurate and pragmatically appropriate uses within a pedagogical grammar of Korean, and then propose a series of pedagogical scenarios that facilitate acquisition of these markers. Most of the errors occurred in extended stretches of discourse rather than in isolated sentences, indicating that teaching discourse markers crucially needs pragmatic strategies that highlight target features in lieu of sentence-level, syntactic approaches. Linguistic analyses of the TM/NM in Korean have often treated them as analogous to their Japanese counterparts (Sohn, 1980); only recently have there been attempts to clarify important differences between the TM/NM in the two languages (E. Lee & Shimojo, 2011). Moreover, Korean pedagogical grammar treats the TM as: (1) a topic marker, (2) a contrastive marker, and (3) a marker of emphasis, and the NM as a subject marker, in much more simplistic terms Japanese pedagogical grammar (Noda, 1996). We propose that TM/NM (and bare nouns and zero pronominais) be taught in more concrete contexts with clear explanations of their discourse characteristics through activities designed to highlight their intended meanings and purposes. We believe that discourse marking should be introduced spirally along strategic points all the way up to advanced levels to reinforce its uses in complex structures and expand the learner's pragmatic repertoire of more subtle and interactional meanings.",,10.2307/korelangamer.18.2013.0040,https://doi.org/10.2307/korelangamer.18.2013.0040,forward

The selected studies document Chinese researchers' efforts to improve the teaching and learning of the Chinese language in terms of language pedagogy, language learning and teacher development. We contend that these studies on the teaching and learning of Chinese as a second or foreign language (CSL/CFL) can contribute to the advancement of second/foreign language education theories even though they were largely conducted to address local needs and interests in the Chinese context. Unfortunately, the impact of these studies on international language education research and pedagogical development remains limited and peripheral.

More specifically, this study explores whether learners with a first language (L1) Cantonese and second language (L2) English background are able to comprehend implied meaning in L3 Mandarin. 14 L1 Cantonese L2 English L3 Mandarin participants with a high intermediate level of Mandarin proficiency took part in the study. There was also a control group of 11 native speakers of Mandarin. Quantitative results based on a 20-item audiovisual interpretation task demonstrate that the L3 learners of Mandarin were not on a par with native speakers of Mandarin in arriving at an intended implicature for the test items. A qualitative analysis of learner responses indicates that the learners’ interpretation of conversational implicatures in L3 Mandarin, although usually successful, was also characterized by repetitions, literal comprehension, and recognition of a gap between the literal and the implied meaning, as well as unintended implicatures.",,10.1515/lingvan-2024-0132,https://doi.org/10.1515/lingvan-2024-0132,forward

This research data is in the form of reduolication of closed class words in the use of language in the mass media. The substantive data source of this research is in the form of text in which there are data in the form of reduplicative forms.

After the data is classified and properly verified, the next step is the analysis and interpretation of the data. The analytical method applied is a distributional method with techniques for direct elements. Finally, the results of the analysis and interpretation of the data are presented in an informal method. The results showed that the most dominant reduplication occurred in closed word classes in Indonesian in the mass media was adverb reduplication. In this study, adjective reduplication was also quite significant, even though it was not the case with adverb reduplication and verb reduplication. Reduplication of nouns occupies the least significant portion. In terms of meanings, research in a semanticopragmatic perspective rather than semantic linguistics is purely necessary to continue to be pursued so that new perspectives can be born in researching language.",,10.22216/kata.v4i1.5249,https://doi.org/10.22216/kata.v4i1.5249,forward

To enhance EFL learners’ competence, this mixed-methods study investigates the effectiveness of CMC on EFL learners’ competence in two settings: CMC-facilitated interaction alone and CMC-facilitated interaction combined with instruction. Fifty-three university-level Chinese EFL students took part in the study. The treatment group had CMC-based interaction with native speakers through instant messaging over the messaging software Skype and received two sessions of instruction in the targeted feature: the speech act of compliment responses (CRs), whereas the control group had CMCbased interaction without any instructional intervention. The result from an independent samples t-test on the post-intervention mean scores indicated a significant difference between groups for appropriately using CRs, favouring the treatment group (p = .011). In addition, qualitative data were gathered via semi-structured interviews to further interpret the quantitative data and unearth factors that would influence L2 learners’ behaviours. Three main themes were derived based on the thematic analysis, encompassing learners’ L2 pragmatic knowledge, the influence of first language on L2, and their English-learning experience. These findings provide further insight into the positive impact of combining CMC with instruction on EFL learners’ competence.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of task complexity on the occurrence of interaction-driven learning opportunities and question development in such a classroom context. Korean university students (N = 191) from four intact English classes were randomly assigned to one comparison group and three experimental groups with various task-complexity levels (i.e., simple, +complex, and ++complex) based on Robinson’s framework. Their interactions were audiorecorded, and occurrences of learning opportunities, operationalized as language-related episodes (LREs), were identified. Question development was identified between pretest and posttests on the basis of the learners’ stage advancement using Pienemann and Johnston’s (1987) developmental sequence. Results indicated that more complex tasks promoted a greater number of LREs and particularly led to LREs targeting developmentally advanced question structures, which result in question development.",,10.1017/S0272263112000368,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263112000368,ancestry

Learners' oral interaction during tasks was audiorecorded and analyzed by the number of pragmatic-related episodes (PREs). Learners' knowledge of request expressions was measured by a discourse completion test (DCT). The results indicated that task complexity levels influenced the occurrence of PREs, but no difference was found in the quality of task outcome between the simple and complex groups. In terms of learning outcomes, both task groups outperformed the control group, but no difference was found on the immediate posttest.

"Younis Salih Fatah, Noor Mala Bt Ibrahim",2020.0,The Importance of Utilizing Pragmatics in EFL/ESL Context,"
 Pragmatics research in the last few years has gained eminence under the impact of Soler and the succeeding paradigms of Communicative Competence. Amid the diverse components of communicative competence, a great number of L2 studies have attended to the concept of pragmatic competence, that deals with both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic knowledge. Hence, pragmatics interlanguage research is concerned with the pragmatic competence and pragmatic performance of L2 learners; though, teaching pragmatics to Non-native Speakers, particularly EFL learners, is a prickly subject. Hence, pragmatic competence has been noticeably absent from ELT curricula, notwithstanding the fact that it has been guaranteed a place in diverse models of Communicative competence. This is mainly due to the hindrances of teaching and learning pragmatics in the ESL/EFL classes. Hence, the study primarily aims at discoursing challenges and lacunas in teaching and learning pragmatics within the confines of EFL classrooms drawing on the existing published literature and proffers recommendations to overcome these problems. Thus, the paper concentrates on these central and prominent fields: the EFL/ESL setting, ELT materials, and available to teach learners, teacher competence, and evaluating pragmatic ability.",,10.21203/rs.3.rs-22375/v1,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-22375/v1,forward

Yu-Cheng Lee,2011.0,Comparison of Politeness and Acceptability Perceptions of Request Strategies between Chinese Learners of English and Native English Speakers,"The politeness issue has received much attention in China in recent years. In regard to Chinese learners of English however, there is still a large gap between politeness displayed and what is felt in western cultures as politeness appropriate. This leads to the unfortunate labeling of Chinese learners of English as “impolite”. While the author does not feel this is necessarily so, the fact remains that language production by Chinese learners and the language expectations by native English speakers show great gaps. This article attempts to identify the factors which affect Chinese English learners’ perceptions of degree of politeness needed in differing situations, and also to study these learners’ perceptions of how much politeness is shown by differing request strategies. After comparing these results with native English speakers, discrepancies between the two groups are analyzed, and an explanation is ventured.",,10.5539/ASS.V7N8P21,https://doi.org/10.5539/ASS.V7N8P21,forward

Drawing on the framework of Exploratory Practice (Allwright, 2005), the present study examines how intermediate-level Taiwanese students of English enrolled in an advanced writing class developed greater pragmatic awareness in email literacy. Instruction was divided into four distinct stages: Setting the context, Modelling, Joint construction and Independent construction. The outcomes, gleaned through questionnaires, class discussions, student presentations, and pre- and post-instruction emails, provide striking evidence of greater pragmatic awareness and positive attitudes towards instruction on email literacy, and pinpoint aspects of email literacy which may require more instructional attention. Overall, this Exploratory Practice offers interesting insights into how instruction on pragmatics in everyday life (email literacy) can contribute to the quality of classroom life for English language students and their teacher.",,10.1177/1362168814562014,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362168814562014,forward

A qualitative analysis of the American raters’ comments was conducted on learner scripts in response to a total of 16 apology and request written discourse completion task (WDCT) situations. The results showed that in content, these raters attended to features, including amount of information, politeness, clarity, and relevance. For form, they focused on grammar, phrasing, and word choice. These features were then incorporated into the scale design, resulting in a scoring rubric consisting of two 10-point subscales, each of which contains five levels with descriptors for each performance level. For scale validation, seven experienced American writing teachers in Taiwan evaluated 84 e-mail requests written by the Chinese learners to their professors. Reliability and validity of the rating scale were explored through the FACETS analysis. The results showed that the scale can be used in a reliable and valid way. The study concludes with a discussion of the usefulness of this rating scale and proposes directions for future research.",,10.1080/15434303.2016.1213844,https://doi.org/10.1080/15434303.2016.1213844,forward

Yunita Uswatun Khasanah,2019.0,A Pragmatic Analysis of Efl Learners’ Social Media Interaction,"As a new and emerging venue of interaction, social media provide an ample opportunity for EFL learners to practice their English mastery and to enhance their socio-pragmatic awareness. However, even though some social media attempt to accommodate and mimic offline communications through their features, there are still technological and platform affordance and constraints that limit what users can do to get their message across. This situation makes a pragmatic analysis of online communication using offline measure a naïve endeavor. To confirm this notion, this paper borrows concepts from relevance theory pertaining to L1 and L2 pragmatics to reveal the patterns of online communication of 43 EFL learners in their social media interaction. The results show that there is a different pattern between online and offline interaction where they share a non-prototypical model of communication, the process of context and meaning construction, as well as their attempt to compensate for what the platform is lacking in accommodating their communication need.",,10.18860/jetle.v1i1.7751,https://doi.org/10.18860/jetle.v1i1.7751,forward

Twenty-four American English learners of L2 Mandarin Chinese at three different proficiency levels completed a three-scenario role-play task. The scenarios were kept low in imposition and social distance but variable in power relations. Each participant interacted with a native speaker interlocutor who assumed different roles in those scenarios. Baseline data were provided by 10 native speakers (NSs) of Chinese. A total of 102 role-plays were coded for request strategies, internal modifications, and supportive moves, as well as the sequential placement of supportive moves in pre-, insert, and postexpansions. Situational variations as reflected in role-play production were considered alongside. The results showed that learners across proficiencies had the same range of pragmatic strategies as in NSs' repertoire, but they showed a general incompetence in employing internal modifications. Learners' ability to delay the requests improved with increasing proficiency, but learner production in general did not show the same level of situational variations as observed in the NS data.",,10.1111/FLAN.12263,https://doi.org/10.1111/FLAN.12263,forward

A pilot study was initially conducted with 41 native English speakers to determine the target responses as the baseline. Definitions and examples were elicited through a 7-item oral, computer-animated comprehension task completed by 143 Chinese learners of English using “Nawmal”, an internet-based animated movie site. Elicited definitions were utilized to investigate meanings that learners assigned to routines based on their PC knowledge, and examples were elicited to detect the functional use to which participants put routines in a fictitious conversation in an ASC. Proficiency bore a negligible relation to routine comprehension alongside any required context knowledge, but SA experience played a decisive role at most levels. Participants tended to offer plausible definitions of routines based on their PC knowledge instead of providing made-up examples that fit within an ASC. Plausible definition-example mappings indispensably resided in the interplay between learners’ actual situational and prior context knowledge.",,10.24205/03276716.2020.1039,https://doi.org/10.24205/03276716.2020.1039,forward

The game in this study showcases several scenarios to players, including virtual conversations between learners and professors, employers, and friends on a virtual American campus. 105 undergraduate students from a university in China participated in this study, covering 10 virtual request scenarios. They are supposed to choose the most appropriate expression in the context presented in the text and video. According to their choice, the corresponding video of the game will display real-time feedback from the interlocutor, which is the authentic reaction and consequence of the learner’s selection, that is, the other party’s response to the request, such as happily accepting, reluctantly accepting, or refusing the request. The results indicate that in game-based teaching, learners gain much more productive knowledge than receptive knowledge. The participants improved their productive knowledge of making requests after playing the game and maintained this gain at delayed post-tests, but their receptive knowledge remained almost unchanged. In addition, metapragmatic knowledge is positively correlated with the participants’ learning outcome of request-making.",,10.56397/jlcs.2023.12.08,https://doi.org/10.56397/jlcs.2023.12.08,forward

Drawing on the notion of collaborative dialogue, this study investigates the extent to which teacher's scaffolding and peers' collaborative dialogue assist EFL learners' to produce requests, apologies, and refusals. It also explores the effect of symmetrical and asymmetrical proficiency pairings during the participants' collaborative dialogue on the production of speech acts. To this end, three intermediate-level intact classes were randomly assigned to the teacher's scaffolding (TS), peers' collaborative dialogue (PCD), and control groups. The PCD group was also divided into symmetrical and asymmetrical pairs based on their pragmatic pretest scores. The treatment lasted for 11 sessions. Each session involved the metapragmatic instruction followed by pragmatic problem-solving tasks, with the TS group getting the teacher's scaffolding and the PCD group collaborating in pairs while doing the tasks. The ANOVA and independent samples t-test results of the post-test scores revealed the superiority of the PCD group over the TS group. Asymmetrical pairs were also found to outperform their symmetrical counterparts. The findings reveal the potentiality of peer mediators in L2 pragmatic acquisition and point to interlanguage pragmatic gains associated with an asymmetrical proficiency pairing.",,10.30466/IJLTR.2020.120807,https://doi.org/10.30466/IJLTR.2020.120807,forward

Interlanguage pragmatic motivation was investigated from two perspectives: (1) general pragmatic motivation, displaying L2 learners’ motivation to acquire pragmatic strategies, pragmatic routines, politeness strategies, turn-taking patterns, and cultural familiarity; and (2) speech-act-specific motivation, representing learners’ motivation to acquire the pragmalinguistic forms and sociopragmatic norms of performing speech acts. Seventy-five EFL learners were studied using two pragmatic motivation questionnaires and a discourse completion task. The relationships among the general pragmatic motivation, speech-act-specific motivation, and pragmatic production were then investigated. The findings showed that EFL learners are highly motivated to learn English language pragmatic features from both motivational perspectives. Further analyses revealed that the learners fell short of having satisfactory L2 pragmatic production. Regression equations revealed that speech-act-specific motivation has the explanatory power of predicting pragmatic production in EFL learners but general pragmatic motivation does not manifest such an influence on L2 learners’ production. It is concluded that high general pragmatic motivation does not necessarily correlate with better pragmatic production.",,10.1177/0033688212468481,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033688212468481,forward

One of the under-explored domains of L2 pragmatics is the role of learning strategies specifically tailored for the development of ILP knowledge. Therefore, this investigation aimed to determine the significant interlanguage pragmatic learning strategies (IPLS) used by high vs. low L2 pragmatic achievers. It was conducted in two phases. First, a multiple-choice discourse completion test including five common English speech acts was administered to 500 EFL learners. Next, 80 highest and 80 lowest ILP performers were orally interviewed and their answers were audio-taped. The most important interlanguage pragmatic learning strategies were extracted from L2 learners' interviews. The elicited IPLS were arranged based on Cohen's (2005, 2010) classification, the findings of the study itself, and an analogy with general language learning strategies (LLS) classification suggested by Oxford (1990). The extracted IPLS were divided into six categories of memory-related, cognitive, social, affective, metacognitive and compensatory IPLS. The high ILP performers used more strategies in all the six categories. The main conclusion of this study is that the use of more IPLS means a better ILP knowledge of speech acts. The most significant implication of the current study was that ILPS need to be taught to L2 learners to enhance their ILP knowledge in general and their speech-act-specific competence in particular.",,10.22099/JTLS.2015.3016,https://doi.org/10.22099/JTLS.2015.3016,forward

This study examined the defossilizing effect of corpus-driven activities on 10 situationally-based pragmatic routines under two instructional conditions, i.e. input-based and output-based treatments. Participants were 33 advanced EFL learners in two classes in a private English language center. They received instruction in four sessions across two weeks. Before and after the treatment, a WDCT was administered for pretest and posttest purposes. The results of paired-samples and Independent Samples t-tests showed that input-enhancement and output-based instructions were effective in defossilization pragmatic routines which had a strong fossilization tendency among learners. Both treatment tasks led to significant increases in learners’ comprehension and production of the routines. The output-based group; however, significantly outperformed the input-based group in the production of the routines. The findings indicate that pragmatic instruction can debilitate the fossilization tendencies of pragmatic routines and that different instructional tasks have differential effects on the production and comprehension of pragmatic routines.

This study aimed to explore the impact of nonnative teachers’ professional experience on the use of criteria in monologic and dialogic assessment of 12 role-plays of 3 apology speech acts. To this end, 60 raters were divided into 2 subgroups of raters with under and over 5 years of professional experience and rated the role-plays monologically and dialogically. A content analysis of the raters’ descriptions of the ratings showed 3 groups of criteria: the general criterion (appropriateness), pragmalinguistic criteria (linguistic features, L1 effect, paralinguistic features, directness, and adequacy), and sociopragmatic criteria (politeness, repair, truthfulness, promise, thanking, reasoning, personal trait formality, genuineness, and expression of apology). We also discovered that neither the more experienced nor the less experienced raters paid due attention to the sociopragmatic criteria in the monologic and dialogic ratings of pragmatic performances. Both groups of raters based their ratings primarily on the general criterion of appropriateness in the dialogic ratings. However, in the monologic ratings, the more experienced ones preferred pragmalinguistic criteria, and the less experienced ones opted for the appropriateness criterion. An analysis of the influence of the type of rating on the raters’ application of criteria showed that the raters differed in the use of all the 3 groups of criteria in the monologic ratings, whereas in the dialogic ratings, their difference in the application of criteria narrowed down to the sociopragmatic criteria. The findings have implications for teacher education programs on pragmatic assessment, urge considerations for the role of teachers’ experience in pragmatic assessment, and stress the inclusion of dialogic ratings in the assessment of speech acts for improving the quality of raters’ assessments.",,10.22055/RALS.2015.11257,https://doi.org/10.22055/RALS.2015.11257,forward

Moreover, the classes of 30 teachers were observed based on a 20-item observation checklist that was developed by the researchers and analyzed qualitatively. Results indicated that the teachers' awareness of pragmatics was relatively high only in one of the components of pragmatic awareness, namely language teachers. However, observation results indicated that they did not consistently teach pragmatic features in their classes. In addition, it was revealed that, except for the component of Language teachers, the differences between less and more experienced teachers' mean scores on the other components of pragmatic awareness questionnaire were not statistically significant. The low levels of awareness and corresponding practice could be attributed to the fact that meager attention is devoted to pragmatic instruction in teaching education programs.",,10.22132/TEL.2020.118261,https://doi.org/10.22132/TEL.2020.118261,forward

Ignoring politeness as a subject of instruction could be due to the hypothesis that politeness is ingrained in the culture of its use and hence cannot be taught to EFL learners. To investigate this hypothesis, politeness markers proposed by House and Kasper (1981) in their politeness framework were used as the point of departure to teach these markers to two groups of EFL students using film-driven input-enhancement tasks and output tasks. The results of the study revealed the beneficial effect of teaching politeness markers through the two tasks. Whereas the input-enhancement group improved significantly in their comprehension of politeness markers, the output group manifested more gains in their production of these markers. Findings from this study have implications for interlanguage pragmatic instruction, suggesting that politeness is teachable and that different instructional tasks bring about different effects on the production and comprehension of politeness markers.",,10.1177/0033688214555357,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033688214555357,forward

This study aimed to determine what strategies are used by EFL learners in the Iranian context to produce the speech act of apology. Data for the study were elicited through a written discourse completion task from two groups of lower- and higher-proficiency learners studying English at a language center. Consistent with many previous findings, the results revealed that when apologizing all participants considerably preferred “direct apology strategy” to other strategies. By contrast, the indirect strategies of “offering promise of forbearance” and “expressing concern for the hearer” were used the least frequently. The findings did not substantiate any meaningful effect on the appropriateness of EFL learners’ apologies in terms of their proficiency. This study suggests that (1) there is a gap between L2 learners' linguistic development and their pragmatic development, (2) incidental exposure to speech acts is not sufficient for pragmatic development, and (3) there is a need to increase EFL learners' pragmatic awareness.",,10.22132/TEL.2012.54905,https://doi.org/10.22132/TEL.2012.54905,forward

The IF group watched twice more captioned videos and read over the video transcripts with no textual manipulation. The OI group watched videos with no captions and then engaged in dialogue reconstruction tasks. Results of the pragmatic comprehension and production pre-test and post-test revealed the overall effectiveness of the treatment. TE and OI groups performed rather similarly in the comprehension test. Concerning the production test, the OI group performed best, followed by TE, IF, and CO groups. The findings suggest employing input-based and output-based practices to promote learners’ L2 pragmatic knowledge.",,10.1177/1362168819896655,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362168819896655,forward
Zainab Alsuhaibani,2020.0,Developing EFL students’ pragmatic competence: The case of compliment responses,"This study investigated the effect of consciousness-raising instruction and corpus-based instruction on EFL (English as a foreign language) students’ development of compliment responses. It employed a quasi-experimental design with 136 EFL university students divided between three groups: control, consciousness-raising, and corpus groups. A discourse completion test (DCT) was used as a pre- and post-test with all the groups to investigate any significant differences between them. Further, a questionnaire with open-ended questions was used to explore students’ perceptions of pragmatic instruction of compliment responses. The results showed the effectiveness of pragmatic instruction of compliment responses through both consciousness-raising instruction and corpus- based instruction. More specifically, significant differences were found between consciousness-raising group and the corpus group on one hand, and the control group on the other. No significant differences were found between the consciousness-raising group and the corpus group. The results also revealed that the students value the importance of pragmatic instruction indicating that it was important, necessary, useful, and enjoyable at the same time. The article ends with some pedagogical recommendations for pragmatic instruction.",,10.1177/1362168820913539,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362168820913539,forward

Results showed no significant effects of word frequency, word class (i.e., adjectives vs. verbs), and type of association relationships (i.e., paradigmatic vs. syntagmatic) on learners' WAT-C performance. More important, vocabulary depth was found to be a significant and unique predictor of reading comprehension over and above vocabulary size. On the other hand, the relative contributions of vocabulary depth and size depended on what types of texts were read and what comprehension skills were assessed. Specifically, for the long passage comprehension task with questions testing literal comprehension, vocabulary size was a more important predictor, whereas for the short passage comprehension task with questions testing inferencing, vocabulary depth was a more important predictor. These findings were discussed in light of the different levels of lexical complexity between the short and long passages and the different cognitive processing demands the questions of the two comprehension tasks placed on learners.", Journal Article,10.Un/flan.12225,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/chinese-l2-learners-depth-vocabulary-knowledge/docview/1855295266/se-2?accountid=9902,llba
Zhenwen Hu,2014.0,Study on Developing Chinese College EFL Learners' Pragmatic Competence in Relation to Language Proficiency and Overseas Experience,"Pragmatic competence refers to both knowledge of the linguistic forms which realize particular illocution, and knowledge of the appropriate use of the linguistic forms in certain social contexts. It is an important part of the language proficiency construct. However, studies in China show that College English students' pragmatic competence is poor. Unlike second language learners, students learning English as a foreign language in China do not have many opportunities to be exposed to authentic language use. If they are not provided with sufficient pragmatic knowledge, they will have more difficulty in understanding and producing appropriate use in the target language. This paper focuses on the development of pragmatic competence and awareness on the part of college English learners in China.  Overseas experience and language proficiency are treated as two main variables which may influence students' PC development. With some data collection from students in Shanghai Second Polytechnic University, findings shows that there are significant differences in the acquisition of pragmatic competence between students with overseas experience and students without overseas experience, yet no significant differences in the acquisition of pragmatic competence between students with high and low language proficiency.",,10.4304/JLTR.5.2.391-398,https://doi.org/10.4304/JLTR.5.2.391-398,forward

Ninety-six high school English learners were assigned to groups for text-based chat, audio chat, and face-to-face interactions to complete a collaborative writing task in pairs. Two versions of the Written Discourse Completion Test (WDCT) were employed as pre-tests and post-tests to assess and compare the learning outcomes in request-making across the three groups. Cognitive and social engagement of learners were assessed by using multiple measures derived from chat logs and recordings, while a post-task questionnaire was utilized to gauge emotional engagement during the task. The results indicated that learners in the face-to-face and audio-chat conditions demonstrated higher levels of cognitive engagement compared to the text-chat group. The text-chat group reported fewer instances of negative emotions. In terms of request learning outcomes, all groups showed an increase in sociolinguistic appropriateness; however, no significant differences were found in overall pragmalinguistic competence. Social and emotional engagement significantly correlated with sociopragmatic improvement in the audio-chat mode, yet these indicators did not demonstrate significant predictive power.",,10.3389/feduc.2024.1454387,https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2024.1454387,forward

Eighty-two non-English major students participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to two groups, an experimental group that received explicit metapragmatic instruction on compliment responses and a control group that did not. A pretest-posttest research design was adopted. The data were collected through a written discourse completion task (WDCT) with six scenarios concerning the topics of appearance, performance, and personality. The results revealed that learners who received explicit instruction dramatically decreased their use of Accept strategy and increased Combination (CB) strategy at the macro level; more specifically, a decrease in Appreciation and an increase in Accept + Accept at the micro level. The learners of the control group made little progress in their performance.

 Pragmatic competence consists of both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic components. The choice of pragmalinguistic strategies aligned with sociopragmatic norms may vary based on situational, cultural, and individual variables. The relationship between these important aspects of second language pragmatic competence, however, is underdeveloped in the literature. To fill this gap, the present paper is aimed at investigating the pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic variations of the Iranian EFL learners from different proficiency levels. A written discourse completion task (WDCT) was adopted for collecting data. Data were analyzed using the coding categories for apologies developed in the previous benchmark studies. The findings of the study provided evidence showing both sociopragmatic and pragmalinguistic development across the levels of language proficiency.

Pragmatics research has also primarily focused on learners’ ability to produce native-like language forms, specifically speech acts, often elicited via discourse completion tasks (Jeon & Kaya, 2006). To supplement such research, the present study used ethnography of communication (Saville-Troike, 2002) to examine whether and how 17 second-semester learners of German developed sociopragmatic competence by participating in computer-mediated communication.

Zsuzsanna I. Abrams,2020.0,Key Concepts in Intercultural Communication,"Throughout our lives we becomemembers of and learn to communicate in an ever-increasing range of social groups: our families, friends, colleagues, and strangers in familiar and unfamiliar situations. Our interactions in these communities helps us “acquire the culturally requisite skills for participating in society, including appropriate ways of acting, feeling, and thinking” (Ochs & Schieffelin, 2008, p. 3). We perform different social roles in various social groups, and mostly weave seamlessly among our social selves, without much awareness of the subtle rules that guide our beliefs, behaviors, and communication. Typically, there is little consequence to our lack of awareness, and it is not until we embark upon an intercultural journey – traveling to a new country or meeting people with different cultural backgrounds from ours – that our assumptions are put to the test, and we are confronted with the revelation that how we have always communicated might not work everywhere or in every situation. Since the world is increasingly connected socially, politically, economically, and technologically, due to growing immigration and innovations that have made travel and communication easier (Mauranen, 2012; Neuliep, 2018), such intercultural encounters are now the norm rather than the exception. Consequently, learning how to interpret and participate in this interconnected world is a basic necessity and responsibility of twenty-first-century global citizenship. Being aware of our beliefs, behaviors, and communicative practices – the way they shape our thinking and interactions – can facilitate more effective encounters with members of other cultural groups. Martin and Nakayama (2018), Jackson (2014), and Oetzel (2009) identify several imperatives for studying intercultural communication: peace, economics, technology, demographics, ethics, and self-awareness. Striving for peace through improved communication can help mitigate conflict and",,10.1017/9781108780360.002,https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780360.002,forward

 Motivation has an effect on the rate and success of second language (L2) learning. However, little is known about its role
 in students’ levels of L2 pragmatic awareness. This study investigated whether and to what extent students’ L2 motivation influences their
 pragmatic awareness. A total of 498 Chinese university students completed a two-part web-based survey (an appropriateness judgement task and
 a motivation questionnaire), of whom 12 were subsequently interviewed. The quantitative results show that pragmatic awareness correlates
 positively with attitudes towards the L2 community and the intended learning efforts. Moreover, a model combining the intended learning
 efforts, attitudes towards the L2 community and attitudes towards learning English can significantly predict pragmatic awareness. The
 analysis of semi-structured interviews reveals a mismatch between students’ immediate needs when learning English and outcomes of pragmatic
 acquisition, which may contribute to the absent correlation between overall levels of L2 motivation and pragmatic awareness.",,10.1075/pc.19022.yan,https://doi.org/10.1075/pc.19022.yan,forward

,2019.0,Congratulation and its Strategies in the Kurdish Language,"Congratulation is part of the study of pragmatics, because it is a speech act. The current study attempts to examine strategies of congratulation in some selected situations in the Kurdish language. This study, entitled „Congratulation and its Strategies in the Kurdish Language‟, has adopted a pragmatic analysis of the congratulation speech act. Statistical formulae have been applied in order to discover the rate of usage of every strategy employed in congratulation. The present study has followed Elwood‟s model in analyzing these strategies of congratulation in the Kurdish language. The main purpose of the study is to clarify the strategies of congratulation used in particular situations, and the rate of their usage in the Kurdish. The study is divided into two parts. The first section contains a general definition and overview of the types of the congratulation; pragmatics and congratulation, and Kurds and the strategy of congratulation. The second part is devoted to the strategies of congratulation used in the Kurdish language.",,10.21271/zjhs.23.4.8,https://doi.org/10.21271/zjhs.23.4.8,forward
