J. Cenoz,2005,BILINGUALISM: BEYOND BASIC PRINCIPLES,"BILINGUALISM: BEYOND BASIC PRINCIPLES. Jean-Marc Dewaele, Alex Housen, and Li Wei (Eds.). Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters, 2003. Pp. ix +233. £49.90 cloth, £22.95 paper. This volume is a festschrift in honor of Hugo Baetens Beardsmore on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday and the twentieth anniversary of the publication of his book Bilingualism: Basic principles (1982). The volume includes 12 articles in addition to an introduction and a laudatio. The volume reflects the important developments of studies in bilingualism in the last 20 years and covers a great variety of areas related to the sociolinguistic, educational, and psycholinguistic dimensions of bilingualism. The first chapter is a reprint of one of Baetens Beardsmore's lesser known publications (1988) and discusses the fears of bilingualism at different levels. Fifteen years later, this chapter still addresses the most important issues related to bilingualism often discussed by teachers, parents, and policy makers. The next three chapters focus on the social aspects of bilingualism: Edwards discusses bilingualism and identity in chapter 2, Clyne addresses the role of intrinsic motivation and metalinguistic awareness in bilingualism in chapter 3, and Cummins examines the differences between the criticism against bilingual education in the American press and the positive results of research on the outcomes of bilingualism in chapter 4. These three chapters each have a different focus but taken together provide an interesting perspective of the social factors affecting bilingualism. Chapter 5 by Martin and chapter 7 by Jones discuss multilingual education in Brunei. These two chapters describe the languages used in schools, the educational context, and the most recent changes in education in Brunei and could be of interest for educators in other bilingual contexts. Chapter 6 by Baker and chapter 8 by Wei and Milroy both discuss language and society but focus on minority languages in two completely different settings—Wales and Singapore. Both chapters discuss interesting theoretical aspects that are then applied to specific settings. Chapter 9 (Fraser Gupta) has a very weak link to the rest of the chapters in the book and analyzes seven self-study books of Malay from different periods. Chapter 10 (Lüdi) and chapter 11 (Myers-Scotton) discuss interesting theoretical aspects of codeswitching, and the last chapter (Genesee) focuses on the similarities and differences between early monolingual and bilingual acquisition. These three chapters are more research oriented than the rest of the chapters in the book, both because of their theoretical basis and the empirical data they discuss. They may also be the most interesting for researchers in SLA.",142634697,10.1017/S0272263105280051,
"Laura Collins, P. Trofimovich, Joanna L White, W. Cardoso, Marlise Horst",2009,Some Input on the Easy/Difficult Grammar Question: An Empirical Study,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether it is possible to distinguish between “difficult” and “easy” constructions for second language (L2) learners by examining characteristics of the structures as they occur in aural input. In a multidimensional analysis of 3 English structures with different acquisition profiles—the simple past, possessive determiners his/her, and the progressive aspect—we examined the phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexicosemantic characteristics of the forms as they occurred in a 110,000-word corpus of instructional talk to L2 learners. We analyzed the type/token distributions of the forms, their lexical properties, and their perceptual salience. Our findings revealed key input factors that distinguished between the early-acquired progressive, on the one hand, and the later-acquired past and his/her determiners, on the other hand. These results lend support to theoretical accounts of the input–acquisition relationship and also generate hypotheses for manipulating instructional input to increase the salience of opaque constructions.

K. Fordyce,2014,The differential effects of explicit and implicit instruction on EFL learners’ use of epistemic stance,"This study investigated the immediate and long-term effects of explicit and implicit classroom interventions on L2 pragmatics. The linguistic focus of the interventions was epistemic stance, which has rarely been studied in research on instructed SLA within the field of interlanguage pragmatics. Eighty-one learners of English at a Japanese university were divided into explicit (n = 37) and implicit (n = 44) groups for 3 hours of instruction. Written production data were collected before the interventions, immediately after them, and five months later. Learners' use of epistemic stance forms was analysed by using: (i) a measure of individual use of epistemic stance forms; and (ii) learner corpus analysis. The explicit intervention was found to be considerably more effective than the implicit intervention in both the short- and long-term for most of the targeted forms. However, in cases when learners lacked a form for a specific function before the intervention, both types of instruction appeared to be equally effective. While this research generally provides strong support for explicit instruction, the potential of implicit interventions for certain forms needs further investigation.",145583248,10.1093/APPLIN/AMS076,
Yo-an Lee,2006,Towards respecification of communicative competence : Condition of L2 instruction or its objective?,"The concept of communicative competence is one of the most influential theoretical developments in language education as it helped redefine the objectives of L2 instruction and the target language proficiency. While acknowledging these contributions, this paper asks if the conceptual formulation of communicative competence has other relevancies for our understanding of the realities of language use in L2 instructional settings. Classroom interaction itself is an occasion of language use that relies on the competence of the parties to the interaction; the competence that is already in the room is then a constitutive feature of the work-practices of teaching and learning. Informed by Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis, this paper proposes that communicative competence may be as much the condition of L2 instruction, one that makes L2 instruction possible in the first place, as its target outcome. Brief analyses of transcripts from ESL classrooms are offered to demonstrate how the communicative competence found in L2 classrooms is a contingent resource for language teaching and learning.",7483022,10.1093/APPLIN/AML011,

"Hossein Vahid Dastjerdi, Majid Farshid",2011,The Role of Input Enhancement in Teaching Compliments,"To date, research regarding the effectiveness of instruction on the development of interlanguage pragmatics has favored an explicit instruction of the speech acts. A question which has received scant attention is what kind of explicit instruction is more beneficial in a foreign language setting. The fact that speech acts reflect, for the most part, routinized language behavior helps learners because much of what is used in performing speech acts could be learned as prefabricated units. This study is an attempt to practically test this routinized nature of speech acts focusing on compliment giving. To this purpose, two groups were chosen as control and experimental groups and both were instructed by different procedures of input enhancement; the former was taught through Form Comparison procedure and the latter through explicit instruction using Wolfson and Manes (1980) formula of compliment giving. The result clearly indicated that the experimental group outperformed the control group in giving compliments, indicating once again that the routinized nature of speech acts could be utilized in helping learners develop their interlanguage pragmatics.",62567889,10.4304/JLTR.2.2.460-466,
Rachel L. Shively,2010,From the virtual world to the real world: a model of pragmatics instruction for study abroad,"Abstract: With its focus on the use of language forms in cultural context, the study of pragmatics can be a valuable component in a program that prepares students to learn both language and culture in study abroad. The goal of the present study is to propose a model for pragmatic instruction in study abroad that fosters both intercultural competence and language skills, is informed by research and practice, and takes advantage of the affordances that an immersion environment and new technologies offer. The article provides an overview of the pertinent research, discusses the pedagogical implications of an ethnographic research project on the acquisition of Spanish pragmatics in study abroad, and presents a model for pragmatic instruction in the study abroad context. Key words: intercultural competence, pedagogical intervention, pragmatic development, second language acquisition, study abroad As a second rather than a foreign language environment, the study abroad (SA) context is considered by some to constitute, a priori, a ''rich'' environment for language and culture learning. However, research in the past two decades indicates that SA students do not always experience the intense exposure to the target language (TL) and culture and the accompanying gains in language proficiency and intercultural competence that were once assumed (DeKeyser, 1991; Freed, 1999; Laubscher, 1994; Miller & Ginsberg, 1995; Pelligrino, 1998; Wilkinson, 1998). In some cases, for example, SA students do not improve their TL skills more than peers who stay at home and study the TL (cf. Freed, 1995; Rodri'guez, 2001). The reasons why a sojourn abroad does not always result in the expected language- and culture-learning outcomes are numerous and complex (cf. Kinginger& Belz, 2005; Magnan & Back, 2007; Pelligrino, 1998; Polanyi, 1995). For example, opportunities for social interaction with members of the host culture may be restricted by difficulty in making contacts (Barron, 2003; Ife, 2000), by experiences of racial and gender discrimination (Polanyi, 1995; Talburt & Stewart, 1999), and by living arrangements (Churchill, 2003; Knight & Schmidt-Rinehart, 2002). However, one way to foster positive language- and culture-learning outcomes in SA is to provide students with training and instruction in language and culture (La Brack, 1993; Paige, Cohen, & Shively, 2004). Of particular interest to the present study is how instruction can assist SA students in the development of their TL pragmatic competence. Pragmatic competence refers to the knowledge and skills needed to use and interpret the meanings, assumptions, and actions expressed by language in its sociocultural context. Research on second language (L2) pragmatic development suggests that pragmatic abilities are acquired rather slowly during naturalistic acquisition (Olshtain & Blum-Kulka, 1985). Not surprisingly then, in the context of a 4- to 9- month SA experience, uninstructed L2 learners typically make only minor gains in target-like pragmatic competence (cf. Barron, 2003; Cohen & Shively, 2007; DuFon, 1999; Hoffman-Hicks, 1999). At the same time, L2 learners in instructed settings have generally been found to benefit from instruction that targets pragmatic features of the TL (Bardovi-Harlig, 2001; Rose & Kasper, 2001), suggesting that instruction can accelerate learning. In addition to the use of face-to-face classroom activities to teach L2 pragmatics, recent studies have indicated how new technologies such as interactive Web sites, synchronous chat, and virtual environments can be effectively used to facilitate pragmatic development (Belz, 2005; Gonza 'lez-Lloret, 2008; Ishihara, 2007; Sykes, 2008). While some authors have bemoaned growing access to technology in SA because it can allow students to disengage from the host culture (cf. Citron, 2003; Ogden, 2006), I argue here that rather than discouraging technology use, SA programs would do better to harness SA students' interest in new technologies as a means to reengage them with language and culture at all stages of SA (cf. …",143018391,10.1111/J.1944-9720.2010.01063.X,
Esther Usó-Juan,2013,Effects of Metapragmatic Instruction on EFL Learners' Production of Refusals,"Research into the teaching/leaming of pragmatic competence in both second and foreign language contexts has shown, in general, that simple exposure to input is insufficient for learners to develop pragmatic competence (Rose, 2005) and therefore, instruction in pragmatics is necessary to facilitate the learning of this competence in order to use language appropriately. In an attempt to expand this line of research, the present study examines the effects of explicit instruction through metapragmatic information on learners' production of an under-researched speech act, that of refusals. Pedagogical intervention is organized progressively in six steps: Researching, Reflecting, Receiving, Reasoning, Rehearsing and Revising (MartinezFlor and Uso-Juan, 2006). These steps are designed to help learners understand the form-function relationship of refusals in different social contexts. Participants' performance in pre- and post-test was compared. Results showed the benefits that this pedagogical proposal can have on learners' pragmatic production of refusals.1 IntroductionOver the last few decades, specifically after the original formulation of the notion of communicative competence (Hymes, 1972), the seminal description of its components for pedagogical purposes (Canale, 1983; Canale and Swain, 1980) and the emphasis placed on the component of pragmatic competence (Bachman, 1990), one of the main goals of language teaching professionals is the development of learners' communicative competence in a second (L2) or foreign (FL) language. As recent models of communicative competence have shown (Celce-Murcia, 2007; Uso-Juan and Martinez-Flor, 2006), communicating appropriately and effectively in the target language requires not only mastery over the features of the language system but also over the pragmatic rules of language use. It is necessary to learn how to use and understand language that is appropriate to the contextual and cultural parameters of the specific situation, because failure to do so may characterize non-native speakers as being insensitive, rude or even offensive. Given this necessity, instruction in pragmatics has been a major concern in communicative language teaching (Martinez-Flor and Uso-Juan, 2010), but still language teachers hesitate to incorporate pragmatics in their classrooms. This hesitation, as summarized by Liu (2010), could be attributed to: i) inadequacy of the description models offered by theoretical pragmaticists (Thomas, 1983); ii) difficulty of teaching pragmatics since it involves a high degree of 'face threat' (Matsuda, 1999); iii) lack of available pedagogical resources for teaching pragmatics (Matsuda, 1999) and iv) lack of valid methods for testing pragmatics (Liu, 2006). Consequently, more interventional studies on pragmatic development that utilize research-based teaching materials and different testing methods should be conducted to inform language educators.Guided by this theoretical framework, the present study attempts to determine the effectiveness of pragmatic instruction on a group of Spanish learners studying English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in relation to the speech act of refusals to requests. The rationale behind the selection of this speech act derives from the fact that, given its face-threatening nature, learners need to possess considerable pragmatic expertise to be able to perform it successfully. To this end, this chapter first presents an overview of the most pertinent research on teaching English refusals to L2/FL learners. Following this, it describes the study with a detailed explanation of the participants, the instructional treatment, the instrument and procedures for data collection and data analysis. Finally, the findings obtained by means of analyzing learners' responses in the pre- and post-test are presented and discussed.2 Literature review on teaching English refusalsA refusal is a speech act that functions as a response to an initiating act such as a request, an invitation, an offer or a suggestion. …",140942745,10.1163/9789401209717_006,
"John R. Anderson, J. M. Fincham",1994,Acquisition of procedural skills from examples.,"Three experiments were run in which Ss first memorized examples of input-output pairs and then generated the outputs for a series of new inputs by analogy to the original examples. Ss first performed these mappings by explicit analogy to an example, but with practice they learned to make these input-output mappings directly without reference to the examples. Ss sped up as a power function of practice over a day (Experiment 1) or days (Experiments 2 and 3). Ss developed a directional asymmetry such that they were slower to calculate the input from the output than the output from the input (whereas initially they had not been). Ss showed similar speed up in their ability to recall the original examples but did not show the same directional asymmetry. Initially, there was some transfer from practicing the procedure to recalling the examples, but this diminished over days.",26660894,10.1037//0278-7393.20.6.1322,

Comparisons of average effect sizes from 49 unique sample studies reporting sufficient data indicated that focused L2 instruction results in large target-oriented gains, that explicit types of instruction are more effective than implicit types, and that Focus on Form and Focus on Forms interventions result in equivalent and large effects. Further findings suggest that the effectiveness of L2 instruction is durable and that the type of outcome measures used in individual studies likely affects the magnitude of observed instructional effectiveness. Generalizability of findings is limited because the L2 type-of-instruction domain has yet to engage in rigorous empirical operationalization and replication of its central research constructs. Changes in research practices are recommended to enhance the future accumulation of knowledge about the effectiveness of L2 instruction.",144168329,10.1111/0023-8333.00136,

While each is relevant for analyses of the target language and its use, nativelike linguistic elements find little support as meaningful acquisition units from a language learner's perspective. Task has more recently appeared as the unit of analysis in three analytic, (primarily) Type B, alternatives: procedural, process, and task syllabuses. Each of these has certain limitations, too, but when the task syllabus is combined with a focus on form in task-based language teaching, the task receives more support in second language acquisition (SLA) research as a viable unit around which to organize language teaching and learning opportunities.",145234547,10.2307/3587368,

This paper investigates the extent to which learners may notice native speakers' reformulations of their IL grammar in the context of dyadic interaction. Thirty-three adult ESL learners worked on oral communication tasks in NS-NNS pairs. During each of the five sessions of dyadic task-based interaction, learners received recasts of their nontargetlike question forms. Accurate immediate recall of recasts was taken as evidence of noticing of recasts by learners. Results indicate that learners noticed over 60–70% of recasts. However, accurate recall was constrained by the level of the learner and by the length and number of changes in the recast. The effect of these variables on noticing is discussed in terms of processing biases. It is suggested that attentional resources and processing biases of the learner may modulate the extent to which learners “notice the gap” between their nontargetlike utterances and recasts.",145686222,10.1017/S0272263103000044,

These layers of interpretation include linguistic forms, nonverbal communication, linguistic context, situational context, and the embodied histories that participants bring to interaction. All are incorporated into a rich definition of discourse. The chapter then reviews recent studies that have compared the discourse of oral interaction in assessment with oral discourse in contexts outside assessment to show how different they are. The next section discusses studies that have related ways of speaking to the cultural values of communities of speakers with a view to understanding the cultural miscommunication that occurs in assessment of speaking in a second language community.

R. Leow,2007,Practice in a Second Language: Input in the L2 classroom: An attentional perspective on receptive practice,"Introduction The role of input is undoubtedly crucial in the process of second/foreign language (L2) learning. Input may be defined as the L2 data (form-based and/or meaning-based) that learners receive either in the formal classroom or in a naturalistic setting. Indeed, how L2 input is presented to L2 learners in the classroom and its effects on the processes learners employ to interact with the input (input processing) have been the focus of several strands of second language acquisition (SLA) studies conducted within a psycholinguistic framework. The theoretical underpinnings of most of these psycholinguistic studies appear to include some role for attention (and possibly awareness) in the processing of L2 grammatical or linguistic data in adult learners' L2 development (e.g., Robinson, 1995; Schmidt, 1990, 1993, 1995, 2001; Tomlin & Villa, 1994; VanPatten, 2004). The term practice has several connotations (see DeKeyser, this volume for an elaborated discussion of this term in several fields of inquiry) in both the applied linguistics and cognitive psychology literatures. In applied linguistics, the notion of pedagogical practice in the typical classroom assumes some form of performance by learners in response to L2 grammatical input they receive in this setting, which may be provided prior to or during practice. In addition, the L2 input is usually manipulated in some form by the teacher. For example, learners may be exposed to L2 that has been carefully selected and manipulated by the teacher to highlight some linguistic data and may be requested to interact with it in several ways, such as selecting options related to the linguistic data in the input, performing a task, and so forth.",58530035,10.1017/CBO9780511667275.004,

The learners completed a computerized listening task that measured their ability to comprehend two types of implied meaning: indirect refusals (k = 24) and indirect opinions (k = 24). The task was given to each group twice, before and after the students received approximately 120–130 hr of classroom instruction. Comprehension was analyzed for accuracy (scores) and speed (average time taken to answer each item correctly). Results showed that, in both learner groups, accuracy and comprehension speed improved significantly over time. For the EFL group, the magnitude of effect was much less for speed than for accuracy. In contrast, ESL learners showed significant improvement in comprehension speed, with a sizable effect size, but only marginal improvement in accuracy.",146479803,10.1017/S0272263108080716,

Satomi Takahashi,2010,The effect of pragmatic instruction on speech act performance,"This chapter reviews previous research on pragmatic intervention by exploring the extent to which the teachability of second-language speech acts is constrained by the nature of intervention and learner-attributable factors. The superiority of explicit pragmatic intervention over implicit treatment is confirmed overall, particularly in the teaching of the sociopragmatic features of speech acts. However, evidence suggests that such positive effects of explicit intervention are not always assured; moreover, some forms of implicit intervention are equally effective. Such variations in the findings are best explained in terms of an explicit/implicit continuum rather than a dichotomous explicit versus implicit framework. The current review also suggests that higher levels of linguistic proficiency and learner motivation may be prerequisites for maximally enhancing pragmatic teachability.",147753285,10.1075/lllt.26.08tak,

J. Leeman,2003,RECASTS AND SECOND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT,"Recasts have figured prominently in recent SLA research, with studies documenting significant advantages for learners exposed to this type of negative feedback. Although some researchers have suggested that such findings imply a beneficial role for negative evidence (i.e., information regarding the impossibility of certain utterances in the language being learned), the source of these benefits has not been explored directly, as multiple variables are conflated in recasts. Specifically, recasts not only offer implicit negative evidence, but they also provide positive evidence. Moreover, recasts are believed to make this positive evidence especially salient. In the present study, 74 learners of L2 Spanish engaged in communicative interaction with the researcher in one of the following conditions: (a) recasts (i.e., negative evidence and enhanced salience of positive evidence), (b) negative evidence, (c) enhanced salience of positive evidence, and (d) unenhanced positive evidence (control). Only the recast and enhanced-salience groups performed significantly better than the control group on posttreatment measures, which suggests that the utility of recasts is derived at least in part from enhanced salience of positive evidence and that the implicit negative evidence they seem to provide may not be a crucial factor.",145714304,10.1017/S0272263103000020,
T. K. Nguyen,2013,Instructional effects on the acquisition of modifiers in constructive criticism by EFL learners,"Previous research has shown that learners of English might experience considerable difficulty when giving constructive criticism to peers in instructional settings. Unlike native speakers, they tend to soften their criticism far less frequently while aggravating it far more often, and thus require pedagogical help in this area. The present study examines whether meta-pragmatic instruction facilitates the learning of linguistic resources for softening constructive criticism in an instructed language-learning context. Fifty Vietnamese high-intermediate-level students of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) were recruited for the control and treatment conditions. Over a period of 10 weeks, the treatment group received explicit instruction in eight types of criticism modifiers while the control group did not receive any equivalent instruction. For data collection, the two groups participated in discourse completion tasks, role plays, and oral peer feedback tasks before and after the treatment. The treatment group was also engaged in writing reflective journals, which were later collected and analysed for instances of input noticing. A delayed posttest was conducted for the treatment group five weeks after the experiment in order to investigate whether instructional effects (if any) lasted beyond immediate post-experimental observations. Findings show positive instructional effects on learners’ pragmatic performance and are discussed with implications for future research.",145675821,10.1080/09658416.2012.658810,
Zohreh R. Eslami,2005,Invitations in Persian and English: Ostensible or genuine?,"Abstract The present study describes the defining features of Persian genuine and ostensible invitations based on a collection of spontaneous Persian invitations and the results of interview data. The results are compared with the structure of invitations in English reported by Isaacs and Clark (1990). The framework for data collection and data analysis designed by Isaacs and Clark and their results were used in this study. Our results show that the structure of ostensible invitations in Persian is more complex than in English. The features suggested for ostensible invitations in English are present, but these are not sufficient to distinguish ostensible invitations from genuine invitations in Persian. Invitations that meet the criteria for being genuine invitations in English can be classified as ostensible by Persian speakers. In contrast to the claim made by Isaacs and Clark regarding English speakers that ‘‘ostensible invitations are rare in most situations’’ (p. 494), our observations show that Persian speakers use a considerable number of ostensible invitations in their daily activities as a manifestation of ritual politeness (ta’arof ). The study concludes that enhancing face (Brown & Levinson 1987) for both interlocutors is the main underlying factor in using ostensible invitations in Persian. In Persian, the speaker, in adhering to societal norms, enhances his / her face as well as that of his / her interlocutor by using ostensible invitations in everyday language.",144169209,10.1515/iprg.2005.2.4.453,

The performance of a treatment group was compared to the performance of a control group on pre-, post-, and follow-up tests consisting of a discourse completion test and an acceptability judgment test. The results indicated that the two treatment groups outperformed the control group, with the identical task repetition group exhibiting more statistically significant improvement in the discourse completion test (a planned written-production test) and the acceptability judgment test (a planned written-judgment test). The results implied that identical task repetition stimulates deeper perceptual and mental processing than task-type repetition in learners' recognition and production of second language (L2) request downgraders.",144018564,10.1515/IP-2012-0004,
R. Dekeyser,1997,BEYOND EXPLICIT RULE LEARNING,"This study is a fine-grained analysis of extensive empirical data on the automatization of explicitly learned rules of morphosyntax in a second language. Sixty-one subjects were taught four morphosyntactic rules and 32 vocabulary items in an artificial language. After they had reached criterion on a set of metalinguistic tests of grammar and vocabulary, they engaged in systematic, computer-controlled comprehension and production practice for 8 weeks. Comprehension practice consisted of choosing between pictures displayed on the computer screen to match a sentence; production practice consisted of typing the correct sentence corresponding to a picture. All subjects were taught the same rules and then practiced them, and all subjects had the same amount of comprehension and production practice, but which rules were practiced in comprehension and which in production varied between groups. Results show that the learning of morphosyntactic rules is highly skill-specific and that these skills develop very gradually over time, following the same power function learning curve as the acquisition of other cognitive skills. These results are consistent with current skill acquisition theory.",146769886,10.1017/S0272263197002040,

"K. Tan, Atieh Farashaiyan",2012,The effectiveness of teaching formulaic politeness strategies in making request to undergraduates in an ESL classroom,"It is widely acknowledged that the main thrust of second language (L2) teaching and learning is establishing and developing the communicative competence of learners. Especially, in recent years, the focus has shifted more towards intercultural communicative competence (ICC). As such, it is more practical that educational endeavors should be directed both towards the grammar or lexis of the target language as well as the appropriate use of these grammatical and lexical systems in a variety of situations by considering different social and contextual factors. Therefore, this study embarks on the effect of explicit instruction of formulaic politeness strategies among Malaysian undergraduates in making request. Sixty Malaysian undergraduates participated in the study. The students included two groups of intervention and control groups. The data were cumulated through three tests, namely open ended completion test, a listening test and an acceptability judgment test. Treatment or experimental group received explicit instruction with structured and problem-solving and input tasks. The comparison was made between the performance of treatment group and that of control in terms of the pre-test and post-test. The findings show that the treatment group outperformed significantly than the control group. This matter is suggestive that in this probe, explicit form-based instruction was successful for learners to comprehend and produce the English politeness strategies effectively in making request. The findings of this study will be beneficial for material developers and teachers to make use of form-focused strategies more effectively to teach second language pragmatic features to Malaysian students.",59430952,10.5539/ASS.V8N15P189,

In order to address this research gap, and taking into account the discussion in research on the concept of attention and related terms such as awareness (see Al-Hejin, 2004, for a review of the role of attention and awareness in second language acquisition research) this paper reports on the benefits of instruction on learners’ attention and awareness during the performance of refusals. Thus, based on a pedagogical proposal for teaching refusals at the discourse level, we focus on the benefits that this pedagogical proposal can have on the information attended to during the planning and execution of refusals. Secondly, we explore whether instruction makes a difference in learners’ awareness of refusals.",54891892,10.6018/IJES/2010/1/113981,

D. Yoshimi,2001,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: Explicit instruction and JFL learner's use of interactional discourse markers,"Introduction The development of L2 pragmatic competence entails the ability to use a wide range of conversational routines and discourse strategies to manage one's communicative interactions with others. Since the early 1980s, researchers have established that a foreign language learner's development of various aspects of pragmatic competence may be facilitated by the instruction of pragmatic routines and strategies in the foreign language classroom (Kasper, this volume). House (1996, p. 247) points out that when such instruction is explicit, it appears to be particularly beneficial since it enables learners to develop an awareness and understanding of the differences between L1 and L2 pragmatic preferences, and thereby “counteract negative L1 transfer through ‘noticing’ (Schmidt, 1993b) and through making attempts to use alternative, more L2 norm-oriented expressions.” In a comparison of the relative benefits of implicit and explicit instruction, House (1996) reports on two sections (i.e., implicit and explicit) of a 14-week communication course instructed in the use of everyday, conversational routines. Through lectures, handouts, and explanatory feedback that provided metapragmatic information on the use and function of these routines, the members of the explicit group had additional opportunities to raise their awareness of preferred L2 pragmatic practices and to “notice” differences between L1 and L2 practices. House argues that the greater improvement shown by the explicit group, particularly in areas where the pragmatic preferences of the learners' L1 differed from those of the target L2, is a result of the learners' heightened awareness of L1-L2 pragmatic differences.",143028035,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.016,

The study also found that teachers and textbooks use DE much more often than native speakers. Learners’ patterns of DE use closely follow those of their teachers and textbooks, suggesting the necessity of explicit instruction in sociolinguistic variants in L2 classrooms.",146404395,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2009.00560.X,
"Eva Alcón-Soler, J. R. G. Pitarch",2013,The Effect of Instruction on Learners' Use and Negotiation of Refusals,"Research into Interlanguage Pragmatics has often focused on the effect of instruction on speech act production. However, features related to the interactive nature of conversation are rarely used in most of the pedagogical proposals for teaching the speech acts. Considering research outcomes on the benefits of pragmatic instruction, the need to conduct pragmatic intervention at the discourse level (Felix-Brasdefer, 2006b; Kasper, 2006) and the value of audiovisual input as a source of pragmatic input (Alcon, 2007; Fernandez-Guerra, 2008; Martinez-Flor, 2008), the present study focuses on the effect of instruction on learners' use of refusal strategies and concern for pragmatics. Alcon's (forthcoming) pedagogical proposal for teaching the speech act of refusals at the discourse level is used during the instructional treatment. In addition, pragmatic input is provided for the present study by means of scenes from the series Stargate, which were controlled for speech act type (refusals to requests) and social distance (+ power and + social distance). Findings from the study support Schmidt's (1993, 1995, 2001) noticing hypothesis, thus providing further evidence that high levels of attention-drawing activities are helpful for pragmatic learning. In addition to the differences as regards learners' use of refusal strategies, learners' attempts to accommodate the non-compliant nature of the speech act of refusals seem to have also been influenced by the teaching of refusals at the discourse level.1 IntroductionResearch into Interlanguage Pragmatics (ILP) has often focused on speech act production. Speech acts such as requests, apologies, complaints and refusals have received a great deal of attention over the years, but most of these studies ignore the interactive nature of conversation in their analyses of speech acts. Similarly, features related to the interactive nature of conversation are rarely used in most of the pedagogical proposals for teaching the speech acts or in most studies on speech act instruction (Martinez-Flor and Alcon, 2007, on suggestions; Olshtain and Cohen, 1990, on apologies; Rose and Ng Kwai-Fun, 2001, on compliments and compliment responses; Alcon, 2005, 2008; Martinez-Flor, 2007; Safont, 2005, 2007; Salazar, 2007; Takahashi, 2001; Uso-Juan, 2007, on requests; Kondo, 2008, on refusals). In addition, although results of these studies support Schmidt's (1993, 1995, 2001) noticing hypothesis and provide evidence of the positive effect of instruction (see also Alcon and MartinezFlor, 2005, 2008; Codina, 2008; Jeon and Kaya, 2006; Rose and Kasper, 2001; Takahashi, 2010), they ignore the interactive nature of conversation and the potential of teaching pragmatics at the discourse level.In the case of refusals, and as reported by Gass and Houck (1999: 2), the complexity of the speech act requires ""face-saving manoeuvres to accommodate the non-compliant nature of the act"". Most of the research on refusals has applied or adapted Beebe et a/.'s (1990) taxonomy, thereby focusing on semantic formulas, especially when dealing with learners or when contrasting NS and NNS use (see Al-Eryani, 2007; Al-Issa, 2003; AlKahtani, 2005; Felix-Brasdefer, 2003, 2006a; Geyang, 2007; Keshawarz, Eslami and Ghahraman, 2006; King and Silver, 1993; Kondo, 2001, 2008; Kwon, 2004; Salazar et al., 2009, among others). However, Felix-Brasdefer (2009) shows clearly that refusals function as a response to an initiating act and they are co-constructed by two or more interlocutors over multiple turns. In a similar line and in the area of language pedagogy, Felix-Brasdefer (2006b) and Alcon (forthcoming) present pedagogical models for teaching refusals at the discourse level. Felix-Brasdefer (2006b) presents three pedagogical sessions for teaching the negotiation of refusals across multiple turns in Spanish. The first one, communicative actions and cross-cultural awareness, focuses on cross-cultural awareness of refusing in English and Spanish, as well as providing pragmalinguistic input on refusals. …",141330287,10.1163/9789401209717_005,

"Neil H. Johnson, J. deHaan",2013,Strategic Interaction 2.0: Instructed Intercultural Pragmatics in an EFL Context,"The potential of web-based 2.0 technology for teaching and assessing intercultural pragmatics has become an area of focus for language educators (Cohen, 2008; Belz, 2005, 2006). Research has highlighted that second and foreign language learners show significant differences from native speakers in language use, in particular, with the execution and comprehension of certain speech acts (Bardovi-Harlig & Mahan-Taylor, 2003). Without effective instruction, differences in pragmatics are evident in the English of learners regardless of their first language background or language proficiency. In EFL contexts, such as Japan, where learners have limited exposure to native speaker norms, teaching and learning pragmatic competence can be particularly challenging. The authors describe an ongoing curriculum development project in a Japanese university context, where the goal is to design and implement an effective approach to teaching interlanguage pragmatics. Digitally enhanced Strategic Interaction (SI) sequences (Di Pietro, 1987) provide opportunities for learners to engage in realistic interactive situations that are mediated by use of model conversations, an online wiki space, and digital video technologies. The online space provides opportunities for learner reflection, peer assisted feedback, and detailed intervention from the instructor. Data analysis from pre- and post- written discourse completion tasks suggests that learners are able to use language in more context sensitive ways having engaged with the teaching/learning cycle design.",16813254,10.4018/jsita.2013010104,

Naoko Taguchi,2007,Task Difficulty in Oral Speech Act Production,"This study took a pragmatic approach to examining the effects of task difficulty on L2 oral output. Twenty native English speakers and 59 Japanese students of English at two different proficiency levels produced speech acts of requests and refusals in a role play task. The task had two situation types based on three social variables: interlocutors� power difference (P), social distance (D), and the degree of imposition (R). In one situation type, the power relationship was equal, the distance was small, and the degree of imposition was small (PDR-low). In the other situation type, the listener had greater power, the distance was large, and the degree of imposition was also large (PDR-high). The participants� production was analyzed for overall appropriateness (rated on a 6-point scale), planning time, and speech rate. Results showed that L2 learners produced PDR-low speech acts significantly more easily and quickly, but little difference was observed in native speakers� production. There was a significant proficiency effect on appropriateness ratings and speech rate, but not on planning time. Post hoc analyses showed that each group demonstrated different patterns in the choice of linguistic expressions over the two situation types, indicating the noteworthy impact of situational variation on oral speech act production.",143596010,10.1093/APPLIN/AML051,
"H. Nicholas, P. Lightbown, N. Spada",2001,Recasts as Feedback to Language Learners,"Some researchers suggest that recasts are effective in showing learners how their current interlanguage differs from the target (Long & Robinson, 1998). Others have argued that recasts are ambiguous and may be perceived by the learner as confirmation of meaning rather than feedback on form (Lyster, 1998a). We review research on the effectiveness of recasts in first and second language acquisition, paying particular attention to how recasts have been defined and how their impact has been assessed in observational and experimental studies. We conclude that recasts appear to be most effective in contexts where it is clear to the learner that the recast is a reaction to the accuracy of the form, not the content, of the original utterance.",145810727,10.1111/0023-8333.00172,
P. Robinson,1995,"Attention, Memory, and the “Noticing” Hypothesis","Schmidt (1990) claimed that consciousness, in the sense of awareness of the form of input at the level of “noticing”, is necessary to subsequent second language acquisition (SLA). This claim runs counter to Krashen's (1981) dualsystem hypothesis that SLA largely results from an unconscious “acquisition” system, the contribution of the conscious “learning” system to SLA being limited and peripheral. Important to a theory of SLA that allows a central role to the act of noticing is a specification of the nature of the attentional mechanisms involved, and of their relationship to current models of the organization of memory. With this in mind the present paper reviews current research into the nature of attention and memory and proposes a model of the relationship between them during SLA that, it is argued, is complementary to Schmidt's noticing hypothesis and oppositional to the dual-system hypothesis of Krashen. In light of this model, I argue that differential performance on implicit and explicit learning and memory experiments is caused by differences in the consciously regulated processing demands of training tasks and not by the activation of consciously and unconsciously accessed systems. I also argue that the attentional demands of pedagogical tasks and individual differences in memory and attentional capacity both affect the extent of noticing, thereby directly influencing SLA.",143695386,10.1111/J.1467-1770.1995.TB00441.X,

The participants of the study consisted of 60 upper-intermediate EFL learners majoring in English Literature and Translation who were divided into two groups: a) the explicit teaching group and b) the implicit teaching group. Accordingly, instruction on various apology situations was provided and the experimental group was asked to have e-communication through e-mail exchanges with their instructor during the semester. The study consisted of a pretest and a posttest which was considered to be quasi-experimental. The independent variable was the explicit teaching of speech acts and the dependent variable was learning success of the participants. After the treatment, the participants were given a posttest. The Analysis of the results revealed that the learners in the explicit teaching group who participated in e-mail exchanges gained significantly in terms of pragmatic proficiency required for strategies of apology. And the use of explicit teaching of apology involving them in e-communication exchanges significantly enhanced the pragmatic awareness of Persian EFL learners.",145161758,10.5861/IJRSLL.2014.661,
G. Kasper,2001,Four perspectives on L2 pragmatic development,"L2 learners' development of pragmatic ability has been studied from a variety of theoretical perspectives. This paper seeks to assess the contributions made by different approaches to interlanguage pragmatics as a subfield of Second Language Acquisition. A first approach locates the development of pragmatic ability within a comprehensive model of communicative competence, either examining pragmatics as an autonomous component or in its interaction with grammatical ability. The discussion focuses on the evidence for and against the interdependence of pragmatic and grammatical ability. A second perspective explores pragmatic learning as information processing, with a particular view to the roles of attention, awareness, input, and metapragmatic knowledge. One important question requiring further exploration is whether principles of grammar learning extend to the learning of pragmatics. A third approach investigates pragmatic learning in sociocultural perspective. A key observation has been that pragmatic knowledge emerges from assisted performance, both in student-teacher and peer interaction. The fourth approach is language socialization, investigating how cultural and pragmatic knowledge are jointly acquired through learners' participation in recurring situated activities. In a final section, the paper discusses whether the four perspectives are compatible or mutually exclusive.",145331770,10.1093/APPLIN/22.4.502,

Since findings in CA describe systematic action sequences underlying verbal activities that display cross-cultural variation, they capture pragmatics in its most natural locus: the conversational encounter. It will furthermore be demonstrated that L2 learners may benefit from instruction with CA-based materials with the ability to anticipate, interpret and produce, socio-pragmatically appropriate verbal behaviour in the target language. CA-based materials thus provide a rich resource for language teachers based on solid empirical evidence, and effectively enable L2 learners to engage in cross-culturally variable language behaviour inside and outside of class.",143498057,10.1191/1362168806lr184oa,

It is less clear, however, whether the kind of communication that occurs in a classroom is sufficient to ensure development of full target language competence. This article examines the extent to which the opportunities for communication in an English as a Second Language (ESL) classroom result in the acquisition of one particular illocutionary act—requests. A total of 410 requests produced by two child learners over 15–21 months were examined. The results suggest that although considerable development took place over this period, both learners failed to develop either the full range of request types or a broad linguistic repertoire for performing those types that they did acquire. The learners also failed to develop the sociolinguistic competence needed to vary their choice of request to take account of different addressees. One explanation for these results is that although the classroom context fostered interpersonal and expressive needs in the two learners, it did not provide the conditions for real sociolinguistic needs.",146654549,10.1017/S0272263100010445,

Participants included 91 English-speaking adults enrolled in fourth-semester college Spanish courses, assigned to the EI + IF group (n = 36), the IF group (n = 30), or the control group (n = 25). The EI + IF group was provided with EI on the function and use of discourse markers. This group also received a flood of input containing the target forms. Students were provided with communicative practice and feedback. In contrast, the IF group did not receive EI + IF on the use of discourse markers. This group received the same flood of input as the EI group. The IF group was presented with communicative practice although there was no feedback. Results of a speaking task administered as a pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test indicated that both treatments had a positive effect on students’ use of discourse markers. Discourse transcripts show that the EI + IF group used more discourse markers to shape their output in student— student communicative exchanges than the IF group. Taken together, results suggest that the combined effect of EI and IF was not superior to IF alone in promoting student use of discourse markers as measured on the post-test speaking tasks.",145500427,10.1177/1362168810388694,
Alison Mackey,2006,"Feedback, noticing and instructed second language learning","Second language acquisition researchers have claimed that feedback provided during conversational interaction facilitates second language (L2) acquisition. A number of experimental studies have supported this claim, connecting interactional feedback with L2 development. Researchers have suggested that interactional feedback is associated with L2 learning because it prompts learners to notice L2 forms. This study explores the relationships between feedback, instructed ESL learners’ noticing of L2 form during classroom interactions and their subsequent L2 development. Interactional feedback was provided to learners in response to their production problems with questions, plurals, and past tense forms. Learners’ noticing was assessed through on-line learning journals, introspective comments while viewing classroom videotapes, and questionnaire responses. Through a controlled pre-test, post-test design, analyses of noticing and learning were carried out for each learner. The results point to an interesting, complex and positive relationship between interactional feedback in the classroom, the learners’ reports about noticing and their learning of L2 question forms.",145594477,10.1093/APPLIN/AMI051,

Additional strengths, such as increased statistical power, moderator analyses, and model testing, have also contributed to its appeal. The current review describes typical stages of a meta-analysis in second language acquisition (SLA) research: (a) defining the research domain, (b) developing a reliable coding scheme, (c) analyzing data, and (d) interpreting results. Each stage has a host of equally reasonable decisions that can be made; each decision will influence the conduct of the meta-analysis, the nature of the results, and the substantive implications of findings for SLA. We highlight a number of benefits and challenges that inform these decisions.

Forty-four college students in a US institution completed three measures three times over a 4-month period: (a) the pragmatic listening test that measured the ability to comprehend implied speaker intentions, (b) the lexical access test that measured ability to make speedy semantic judgment, and (c) the language contact survey that examined the amount of time learners spent in L2 outside the class. The learners' pragmatic comprehension was analyzed for accuracy (the scores on the pragmatic listening test) and comprehension speed (the average time taken to answer items correctly). Results showed that the learners made significant improvement on comprehension speed but not on accuracy of comprehension. Lexical access speed was significantly correlated with comprehension speed but not with accuracy. The amount of speaking and reading outside class that the students reported on the language contact survey significantly correlated with the gains in comprehension speed but not with accuracy of comprehension.",145544405,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00434.X,

"Maria-Pilar Safont-Jordà, Laura Portolés-Falomir",2013,Research Method Effects on Third Language Learners' Refusals,"Research in interlanguage pragmatics has largely ignored the multilingual background of language learners (Kasper, 2007, Safont-Jorda, in press). Although some studies have been conducted (Safont-Jorda, 2003, 2005a, b; Safont-Jorda and Alcon, in press), they have focused on the learners' requestive behavior. No studies on L3 learners' refusals have been published to date. Additionally, research methods employed in the analysis of L2 and L3 learners' pragmatic competence elicit the target pragmatic item in an artificial way, whether it be, written (i.e., Discourse Completion Test) or oral (i.e., role-play), as they provide learners with a written/oral prompt for an imaginary situation. In fact, learners provide potential answers (provided that fact tool place). Researchers have widely criticized this approach as it does not account for real communication. There are a number of situational factors influencing pragmatic and communicative development as shown by recent research (Dewaele, 2007) which are not considered if data collection is restricted to controlled pragmatic production. On that account, this paper compares refusal strategies employed in a DCT and in an instructional setting, that of the language classroom, by second and third language learners. Participants were 12 adult English learners engaged in an intermediate English course. They were Catalan-Spanish bilingual (6 subjects) and Spanish monolingual (6 subjects). As expected, results show a difference in the type of refusal strategies employed in real (i.e., classroom) and royal (i.e., oral role-play) interaction and they also point to the advantage of L3 over L2 learners in the variety of refusal strategies employed.1 IntroductionThe main aim of the present paper is to examine the effect of two variables on the pragmatic production of learners of English as a Foreign Language. On the one hand, we have taken into account the effect of the research method adopted on the use of refusal strategies. On the other, we have considered the learners' linguistic background, that is, whether they were monolingual or bilingual and thus were learning English as a second (i.e., L2) or as a third language (i.e., L3). Bearing our purpose in mind, we shall first consider those studies which have contrasted results obtained by means of an oral production task and those using ethnographic or pseudo natural data. Secondly, research on the role of bilingualism in language learners' pragmatic production will be taken into account and a particular focus will be given to the use of L3 refusals. Finally, results from our study on the effect of the research method and bilingualism in English learners' production of refusals will be described.1.1 Research methods in IL exhortative actsAccording to Clark and Bangerter (2004), three main methods have been employed in pragmatics research, namely those of intuition, observation and experiment.(...) With intuitions, you imagine examples of language used in this or that situation and ask yourself whether they are grammatical or ungrammatical, natural or unnatural, appropriate or inappropriate. This was Searle's method. With experiments, you invite people into the laboratory, induce them to produce, comprehend or judge samples of language, and measure their reactions. With observations, you note what people say or write as they go about their daily business. We will name these methods by their characteristic locations: armchair, laboratory andfield (Clark and Bangerter, 2004: 25).Interlanguage pragmatics research has adopted methods employed in LI pragmatics, and has particularly made use of 'laboratory' experiment methods. As stated by Jucker (2009), these elicitation techniques (i.e., laboratory) rely on the informants' cooperation. Participants have to imagine situations and report the way they would behave or the way they would expect others to behave in them. Some authors seek to determine the most effective method for measuring pragmatic ability (Brown and Ahn, 2011; Yamashita, 1996). …",141685205,10.1163/9789401209717_011,
"N. Ellis, Laura Collins",2009,"Input and Second Language Acquisition: The Roles of Frequency, Form, and Function Introduction to the Special Issue","The articles in this special issue explore how the acquisition of linguistic constructions as form–function mappings is affected by the distribution and saliency of forms in oral input, by their functional interpretations, and by the reliabilities of their form–function mappings. They consider the psycholinguistics of language learning following general cognitive principles of category learning, with schematic constructions emerging from usage. They analyze how learning is driven by the frequency and frequency distribution of exemplars within construction, the salience of their form, the significance of their functional interpretation, the match of their meaning to the construction prototype, and the reliability of their mappings. These investigations address a range of morphological and syntactic constructions in instructed, uninstructed, and laboratory settings. They include both experimental and corpus-based approaches (some conducted longitudinally) and consider the relationship between input and acquisition in the short term and over time, with a particular emphasis on spoken input directed to second and foreign language learners.

By establishing a different set of inclusion/exclusion criteria than previous meta-analyses and performing a series of methodological moves, it is intended to be an update and complement to previous meta-analyses. Altogether 33 primary studies were retrieved, including 22 published studies and 11 Ph.D. dissertations. These studies were coded for 17 substantive and methodological features, 14 of which were identified as independent and moderator variables. It was found that (a) there was a medium overall effect for corrective feedback and the effect was maintained over time, (b) the effect of implicit feedback was better maintained than that of explicit feedback, (c) published studies did not show larger effects than dissertations, (d) lab-based studies showed a larger effect than classroom-based studies, (e) shorter treatments generated a larger effect size than longer treatments, and (f) studies conducted in foreign language contexts produced larger effect sizes than those in second language contexts. Possible explanations for the results were sought through data cross-tabulation and with reference to the theoretical constructs of SLA.",142968009,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2010.00561.X,
"Leila Ranta, R. Lyster",2007,Practice in a Second Language: A cognitive approach to improving immersion students' oral language abilities: The Awareness-Practice-Feedback sequence,"Consider the experiences of a grade-12 student who has studied French for a total of 13 years in Alberta, the first few years of which were in a total immersion program where all instruction was in French. She travels to Montreal for the first time. To her great shock, she finds that she is unable to use her French very much because the bilingual speakers she comes into contact with switch to English the minute they hear her speak. She comments, “I quickly realized … that my French is not the same as Quebecois French” (Haynes, 2001). This experience of communicative failure in the second language (L2) puts a human face on the research findings that characterize the oral production of French immersion students as being “non-nativelike.” Immersion researchers have studied the effectiveness of different types of pedagogical interventions designed to overcome the limitations of immersion instruction. These interventions have included enriching the input learners are exposed to (Harley, 1989b), drawing learners' attention to non-salient features of the L2 (Lyster, 1994), increasing the amount of student output (Kowal & Swain, 1997), and providing unambiguous feedback on learners' non-targetlike utterances (Lyster, 2004). This chapter examines the issue of the non-nativelike quality of immersion students' L2 production from the perspective of the language practice that occurs in early immersion classrooms. In this discussion, we highlight the value of using cognitive skill-learning theory (Anderson, 1983) as a framework for sequencing instructional activities aimed at improving the formal accuracy of the otherwise fluent speech of immersion students.",56637212,10.1017/CBO9780511667275.009,

The intervention consisted of a brief face-to-face orientation to learning speech acts, a self-study guidebook on language and culture strategies, which included strategies for learning speech acts, and electronic journaling by the students. The study used an experimental design in which the participants, all university students (N = 86) who spent 1 semester abroad in a Spanish- or a French-speaking country, were randomly assigned to an experimental (E) group (N= 42) or to a control (C) group (N= 44). The findings indicated that the students as a whole improved their request and apology performance over the course of 1 semester, as rated by the Spanish and French native speakers. In addition, whereas there were no statistically significant differences between the E and C groups in their rated speech act performance overall, a qualitative analysis of speech act development among learners of Spanish (N= 67) helped to identify areas in which their performance on requests and apologies either resembled that of native speakers or diverged from it. Although fewer students than native speakers used the “query preparatory with verbal downgrading,” there appeared to be some increase in the use of this strategy by study-abroad students from pre- to posttest, especially among the E group students, perhaps suggesting that for some of these students awareness about mitigating requests was enhanced by the treatment. In making apologies, not as many study-abroad students intensified their apologies in instances where native speakers tended to do so. Likewise, the percentage of study-abroad students who acknowledged responsibility for certain infractions tended to be lower than that of the native speakers, suggesting that these nonnative speakers were unaware of sociopragmatic norms for what might be expected in such situations.",145334156,10.1111/J.1540-4781.2007.00540.X,

Both researchers and practitioners have noted consistently that several aspects of the teaching and tutored learning of L2 pragmatics have been reported as problematic and/or underexplored in the published knowledge base to date, including the availability and authenticity of instructional materials, the provision of opportunities for the performance and practice of L2 pragmatic competence in meaningful interactions, the relative lack of developmental data documenting the precise (and varied) pathways of L2 pragmatic competence over time, and the efficacy of particular pedagogical interventions in classroom-based L2 pragmatics instruction. The role of computer mediation in each of these underexplored areas is examined with a special emphasis on the teaching and learning of L2 pragmatics in Internet-mediated partnerships and on the use of (learner) corpora in L2 pragmatics instruction and research.",55637767,10.1017/S0267190508070037,

This report describes a research project that tracks the development of skilled migrants' sociopragmatic performance over 12 weeks from the classroom to the workplace. The research reported here focuses on requests in workplace interaction. Learners often have difficulty negotiating culturally appro priate content in particular speech acts, such as requests in specific contexts, even when they are able to identify the semantic features and formula required. In other words, it is often culturally appropriate content and form that learners struggle to identify (Bardovi-Harlig Sc Griffin, 2005; Bardovi-Harlig & Hartford, 1993). This study tracked the development of learners' sociopragmatic proficiency as they developed awareness of cultural differences in the appropriate expression of requests in New Zealand workplaces.",145392154,10.5054/TQ.2010.215252,

Three treatments were implemented: (1) the incidental group was exposed to input and involved in meaningful output activities; (2) the implicit group was aided by visual enhancement of the input; and (3) the explicit group was aided with metapragmatic information. Discourse completion test results show that, when learners are provided with pertinent input and chances for output, visual enhancement can boost their pragmatic development, while metapragmatic information might hinder such development. Only the input-output activities (i.e., the incidental treatment) could produce durable effects in every aspect of the target features. The explicit treatment did produce durable effects in the acquisition of overall supportive moves. The effects of the visual enhancement were not durable. These results are discussed in terms of an interaction between the learner profile (young beginning learners), treatment characteristics, and the nature of target features.",145167858,10.1002/TESQ.2,

When typing, driving a stick-shift car or using a word-processor too edit a text, we perform a complex series of tasks very quickly and efficiently, without having to think about the various components and subcomponents of action involved; sometimes we are even unable to think of them explicitly, and therefore we may have trouble visualizing the keyboard or explaining to somebody else how to use a piece of software, even though – or rather just because – we use the keyboard or the software with great ease. Initially, though, we may have found typing, driving a stick-shift car or using a spreadsheet to be slow, tricky, and tiring. The automaticity, that is the speed and ease with which we ultimately carry out these tasks, is the result of a slow process that we call automatization. Once this process has run its course, the chain of actions involved in the automatized tasks can even become hard to suppress, as we experience when forced to shift from a querty to an azerty keyboard, from a stick-shift to an automatic car, or from one kind of accounting software to another.",56520429,10.1017/CBO9781139524780.007,

Andrew Sangpil Byon,2006,Developing KFL Students’ Pragmatic Awareness of Korean Speech Acts: The Use of Discourse Completion Tasks,"Teaching pragmatic competence in Korean-as-a-foreign language (KFL) settings is still an underdeveloped area, when compared to teaching other language areas, such as speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The first step to enhance pragmatic language teaching in foreign language (FL) education is to raise the FL instructors’ and students’ pragmatic awareness (Kasper & Rose, 2001). This paper investigates a case of raising pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic awareness of Korean speech acts to intermediate KFL students in an American university, using a discourse completion task (DCT). This study discusses how the DCT approach, as a pragmatic-consciousness-raising (PCR) technique, can assist FL instructors in developing pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic awareness of the target speech acts. The study shows that DCT provided a very practical tool for our students to recognise the pragmatic features. Conducting a survey with L1 and L2 speakers made the learning process more engaging, relevant, and interesting for most students. Although the discussion and procedures presented in this paper are from an American college-level intermediate KFL course, the cases presented may be adapted for use in any foreign language course that has struggled with teaching L2 pragmatic competence.",144456779,10.2167/la410.0,

Specifically, it examines the acquisition of various strategies (e.g., head acts, use of softeners, formality marking, and hearer-oriented directives) to realize Spanish directives. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data detected patterns in the learners' directive production. The analysis considered factors such as instruction, L2 grammatical competence, and the influence of the first language (L1) to illustrate the patterns of development of L2 pragmatics at lower proficiency levels. The results show (a) verb forms with increased morphological complexity replaced lower level directive strategies, possibly as a result of the expansion of L2 grammatical competence; (b) pragmatic competence seems to precede grammatical competence; and (c) the L1 pragmatic system appears to play a role in interpreting and processing new L2 data for use in production.",144316374,10.1111/J.1540-4781.2006.00427.X,

As the rules governing back-channeling vary from language to language, second-language learners may need help acquiring this skill. This paper is an initial exploration of how to provide this. It presents a training sequence which enables learners to acquire a basic Arabic back-channel skill, namely, that of producing feedback immediately after the speaker produces a syllable or two with a sharply falling pitch. This training sequence includes an explanation, audio examples, the use of visual signals to highlight occurrences of this pitch downslope, auditory and visual feedback on learners' attempts to produce the cue themselves, and feedback on the learners' performance as they play the role of an attentive listener in response to one side of a pre-recorded dialog. Experiments show that this enables learners to better approximate proper Arabic back-channeling behavior.",18415053,10.1080/09588220701745825,

The lesson was given by ESL teachers (n = 2) in the United States to EFL students (n = 35) in Japan. Five of the students participated in the videoconference. The remaining thirty were mostly observers. The paper reports on the collaborative development and execution of the videoconference lesson, and its short-term effects on the five participants' use of verbal backchannel signals and reactive expressions. The analysis of student use of these tokens before and after instruction suggests that the pedagogical intervention had a positive short-term effect on student production of reactive tokens. The paper examines the pedagogical implications of the obtained results for the second/foreign language classroom. It also addresses the benefits and challenges of using videoconferencing in teaching pragmatics, and discusses possible avenues for future research.",143949682,10.1515/iprg.2010.013,

Alicia Martínez-Flor,2013,Learners' Production of Refusals: Interactive Written DCT versus Oral Role-Play,"Scholars in the field of interlanguage pragmatics (ELP) have examined second language learners' development of pragmatics by means of employing different data collection instruments (Beebe and Cummings, 1996; Duan, 2008; Houck and Gass, 1996; Martinez-Flor, 2006; Sasaki, 1998; Yuan, 2001). Findings from this research have showed the existence of task effects, since learners' performance varied depending on the task they were involved in. Specifically, given the interactive nature of role-plays and authentic discourse, learners' responses in the oral tasks were longer and more elaborate than those elicited in the written form. Therefore, ILP researchers have claimed the need to further investigate this area by widening the types of instruments being employed as well as the context in which they are used. Bearing these assumptions in mind, the present study aims at examining the effects of two production instruments (i.e., interactive written discourse completion test (DCT) and oral role-plays) on learners' use of refusals in a foreign language setting. The participants included 20 Spanish university learners who were required to make refusals to requests in written and oral production instruments. In these research methods, all situations i) varied according to the sociopragmatic factors of status and social distance; ii) were set at familiar contexts to the participants; and iii) asked learners to perform refusals in the role of students. Learners' performance when making refusals in the interactive written DCT and oral role-plays was compared. Results from such a comparison will be presented and discussed, and pedagogical implications highlighted.1 IntroductionOver the last decades, the area of interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) has shown an increasing interest in examining how learners' pragmatic competence in a second (L2) or foreign (FL) language is learnt and taught (Alcon and Martinez-Flor, 2005, 2008; Ishihara and Cohen, 2010; Kasper and Rose, 2002; Martinez-Flor et al., 2003; Rose and Kasper, 2001; Tatsuki, 2005). Since pragmatic language use is a very complex phenomenon with a lot of contextual factors influencing its actual performance, it is of paramount importance to carefully design the methods2 that elicit learners' production of a given pragmatic feature. In fact, how to collect appropriate data is a crucial issue in pragmatic research since the use of a particular elicitation instrument may potentially influence research outcomes (Alcon and Martinez-Flor, 2008; Nurani, 2009). That is the reason why continuous improvements concerning research methodologies in the pragmatics realm have been developed (Bardovi-Harlig, 1999; Cohen, 2004; Felix-Brasdefer, 2010; Kasper, 2000; Kasper and Dahl, 1991; Kasper and Roever, 2005), although there is still the need to further investigate this area by widening the types of data collection methods created, as well as including learners from distinct linguistic backgrounds (Trosborg, 2010).Within this framework, the aim of this chapter is to examine the effects on two elicitation instruments (i.e., interactive written DCT and oral role-play) on learners' production of refusals in a FL context. To this end, we will first provide a detailed literature review on data collection methods employed in ILP by differentiating between oral and written production data. Additionally, the studies that have been conducted with the aim of comparing both oral and written production data will also be described. Then, we will present our particular study with an explanation of how the two instruments were elaborated. Finally, concluding remarks of the present study will be mentioned and suggestions for further research will be proposed.2 Literature review on data production collection instruments in ILPKasper and Roever (2005) have examined the main methodological approaches that have been employed to analyze how target language pragmatics is learnt. The authors divide the data collection instruments used in ILP into three groups: i) examining spoken interaction; ii) questionnaires; and iii) self-report data. …",141161774,10.1163/9789401209717_010,
"A. Liddicoat, C. Crozet",2001,Acquiring French interactional norms through instruction,"Introduction The emergence of intercultural competence in language teaching (Kramsch, 1993, 1995; Lustig & Koester, 1993; Byram & Zarate, 1994; Crozet, Liddicoat, & Lo Bianco, 1999) has led to a need to focus on a second language as a vehicle for communication in cultural contexts, and this in turn implies that an important goal for language learning is developing an understanding of appropriate communication in the target language (Zarate, 1986; Buttjes & Byram, 1990; Kramsch, 1995; Tickoo, 1995; Fantini, 1997; Liddicoat, 1997b). Consequently, language teaching now needs to be seen more in the context of intercultural communication, with the aim of preparing learners to communicate outside their own cultural boundaries (Bolten, 1993; Crozet, 1996; Liddicoat, 1997b; Liddicoat & Crozet, 1997; Liddicoat, Crozet, Jansen, & Schmidt, 1997; Crozet & Liddicoat, 1999; Crozet et al., 1999). In such a perspective, pragmatic and discoursal practices become an integral part of language learning from early on because they play a central role in intercultural communication, and mismatches between them have been identified as a key factor in communication breakdowns. Many studies have shown that culturally based differences about what is expected during communication can be a significant cause of crosscultural communication difficulties (Gumperz, Judd, & Roberts, 1979; Wierzbicka, 1985, 1991; Kotthoff & Auer, 1987; Gudykunst & Kim, 1992). These expectations may be linked to differences in the realization of particular speech acts, or they may be linked to broader, and often more diffuse, issues of discourse organization and conversational style.",141887945,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.012,

The importance of a research basis for choosing pragmatic materials to teach is underscored, and the focus is put on sources for materials on pragmatics and the means of data collection. Issues in the teaching of pragmatics are considered, including determining which material to teach, how to prepare teachers to teach it, and the role of teachers in facilitating the learning of pragmatics. Next, L2 pragmatics is viewed from the learners' perspective, in terms of the learning and performance of pragmatics, as well as approaches to assessing what it is that learners are able to do in a pragmatically appropriate way. Finally, consideration is given to the role of technology in making pragmatics accessible to learners, with reference to a website for teachers and curriculum writers and to websites designed for learners of specific languages such as Japanese and Spanish. Recent work on virtual environments for practicing Spanish pragmatics is discussed and preliminary findings from a small-scale study of this effort are reported.",145553076,10.1017/S0261444807004880,

Bardovi-Harlig,2001,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: Evaluating the empirical evidence: Grounds for instruction in pragmatics?,"Introduction Everyone who works with a second or foreign language, whether learners, teachers, or researchers, knows a funny story about crosscultural pragmatics – or maybe the stories are really not that funny. From the perspective of the speaker, they may be about feeling silly, helpless, or rude; from the perspective of the listener, they may be about feeling confused, insulted, or angry. Anecdotal evidence inspires us to say that we ought to teach, as one of our ESL students said, the “secret rules” of language. Much research has gone into identifying how speakers of various languages realize speech acts, take turns, and use silence, for example, so that what our student called the secret rules are not unknown; and even if our knowledge is incomplete at this stage, could it form the basis of an informed pedagogy? In other words, is there empirical evidence that warrants the development and implementation of a pedagogy of pragmatics in second and foreign language instruction? In this chapter, I will review the empirical evidence that shows that native speakers (NSs) and nonnative speakers (NNSs) of a given target language appear to have different systems of pragmatics, discuss the factors that influence the development of L2 pragmatics systems, and then address the question of whether differences in pragmatics systems warrant instructional treatment. The evidence This review adopts a speech act perspective. Although it is not the only way of viewing pragmatics, speech act research has been well represented in crosscultural and interlanguage pragmatics research, and provides a common analytic framework which facilitates comparison across studies.",142558425,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.005,

"Elsa Roberts, Burgess, Denise",1995,Teaching particular languages,"outlines the design and development of a course the aimed to meet the needs of ESL students studying in the Faculty of Arts. The development of Critical Language Awareness in relation to general and subject specific study skills is discussed. The term 'Critical Communication Skills' (CCS) is intro-duced and defined. An outline is given of a two-part course. In Part One students work through materials which address CCS in relation to subject of common interest — the media in South Africa. In Part Two the demands of studying specific subjects are presented (e.g. Philosophy). The course is discussed in relation to ESP and critical skills development for use beyond university study. each associated with different types of innovations, highlight a new set of perspectives on the role of perceived attributes of ELT innovations. This paper reports the findings of a study on the intonation of second-language speakers of English from three language groups: Spanish, Japanese and Thai. The investigation focused on how non-native speakers use intonation to signal meaning in the structure of their discourse. Thirty adult speakers of English as a second language at the intermediate level and ten native speaker controls were tape recorded in both oral reading and free speech tasks. The speech data were analysed on a Visipitch machine to measure how pitch and intensity were used contrastively to show relationships in discourse. Following a model of intonational meaning dev-eloped by Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, pitch accents, phrase accents, boundary tones, and para-tones were measured. The study revealed that while the native speakers made significant use of pitch contrasts to signal meaning on the items measured, the non-native speakers did not consistently use pitch to signal meaningful contrasts in many of the same environments. This study investigated the effect of functional-analytic teaching on aspects of French immersion (FI) students sociolinguistic competence at the Grade 8 level. A set of functional-analytic materials, entailing the study and practice of sociostylistic variation, was implemented in three FI classrooms by their respective teachers during French language arts classes over an average period of five weeks. A pre-test, an immediate post-test, and a delayed post-test were administered to the experimental group as well as to a comparison group in order to compare classes on three measures of sociolinguistic competence (defined as the ability to recognise and produce socially appropriate language in context). The study demonstrated that functional-analytic teaching substantially improved aspects of FI students' sociolinguistic competence in at least three ways: (1) by significantly increasing their ability in oral production to appropriately and accurately use vous in formal situations; (2) by significantly increasing their ability in written production to appropriately use vous in formal letters, and, in the short run, to use polite closings in formal letters; and (3) by significantly increasing their ability to recognise contextually appropriate French. speakers showed that: (1) the present perfect serves as the dominant past tense form for main verbs in the German colloquial standard; (2) modal verbs, the copula sein 'be,' haben 'have,' and certain formulaic expression occur in the preterite; and (3) the use of the past tense forms is linked to contextual and social factors. A German syllabus, then, must include a discussion of verb type when presenting the everyday use of the German preterite and present perfect. The study points to the situational and social contexts influencing the use of grammatical structures rather than merely presenting contextless rules governing their use. This study examines the role of illustrations in language learning and presents an analysis of the illustration content of 18 texts for teaching introductory Spanish published between 1960 and 1989. It also discusses the appropriate use of illustrations in teaching and considers future prospects.",143606191,10.1017/S0261444800007953,

A nationwide survey of master's-level TESOL programs was conducted to determine where and how pragmatics is covered in the TESOL curriculum, what resources are used to teach graduate TESOL students about pragmatics, as well as to determine some of the prevalent attitudes, beliefs, and opinions about pragmatics held by TESOL graduate program directors and faculty. Individuals from 94 master's-level TESOL programs in the United States participated in the study. Participating programs represent a variety of geographic regions, institution types, and departments. The findings of the study indicate that pragmatics is covered in a wide range of courses across programs (Sociolinguistics, Discourse Analysis, Introduction to Linguistics, Teaching Methods, SLA, etc.), and that the time spent covering pragmatics varies from no time at all, to more than 8 weeks, depending on the program.

Treatment group performance was compared with that of a control group on a range of input- and output-based pretests, posttests, and follow-up tests. The results indicate that the three treatment groups performed significantly better than the control group, suggesting that in this study explicit input-based instruction was effective both deductively and inductively for learners' comprehension and production of English polite requests.

"Paula M. Winke, C. Teng",2010,Using task-based pragmatics tutorials while studying abroad in China,"Abstract This paper details how a task-based tutorial program for students studying abroad in China can improve the students' pragmatic competence and cross-cultural awareness. We describe the pragmatics tutoring curriculum, the pragmatics learning journals that are part of the curriculum, and a Chinese pragmatics test that we developed and used for this study. Pre- and post-tests of oral Chinese pragmatic ability were given to an experimental group (N = 19) of students who took the tutorial program while studying abroad in China for a summer and to a control group (N = 19) of students who did not take the program or study abroad. The test results, learning journals, and end-of-program surveys showed that the experimental group improved their pragmatic performance and cross-cultural awareness and had a positive attitude toward the enhanced study-abroad program. The study demonstrates that a summer study-abroad program that uses native-speaker interaction to improve pragmatic ability is beneficial. We discuss how and why the explicit teaching of pragmatics can and should be fully integrated into a study-abroad curriculum.",144354614,10.1515/iprg.2010.016,

B. Vanpatten,1996,Input Processing and Grammar Instruction in Second Language Acquisition,"This book provides an alternative to the ""grammar debate"" in second language acquisition theory and teaching. Accepting that language acquisition is at least partially input dependent, the author asks how grammatical form is processed in the input by second language learners and is it possible to assist this in ways that help the learner to create richer grammatical intake. He answers these questions and explains why traditional paradigms are not psycholinguistically motivated. Drawing on research from both first and second language acquisition, he outlines a model for input processing in second language acquisition that helps to account for how learners construct grammatical systems. He then uses this model to motivate ""processing instruction,"" a type of grammar instruction in which learners are engaged in making form-meaning connections during particular input activities.",144396789,10.2307/345093,
P. Skehan,2003,Task-based instruction,"This article is organised in five main sections. First, the sub-area of task-based instruction is introduced and contextualised. Its origins within communicative language teaching and second language acquisition research are sketched, and the notion of a task in language learning is defined. There is also brief coverage of the different and sometimes contrasting groups who are interested in the use of tasks. The second section surveys research into tasks, covering the different perspectives (interactional, cognitive) which have been influential. Then a third section explores how performance on tasks has been measured, generally in terms of how complex the language used is, how accurate it is, and how fluent. There is also discussion of approaches to measuring interaction. A fourth section explores the pedagogic and interventionist dimension of the use of tasks. The article concludes with a survey of the various critiques of tasks that have been made in recent years.",31449611,10.1017/S026144480200188X,

"Majid Farahian, M. Rezaee, Afshin Gholami",2012,Does Direct Instruction Develop Pragmatic Competence? Teaching Refusals to EFL Learners of English,"To achieve communicative competence, L2 learners' need to develop their pragmatic competence and this may be fostered with the help the learners receive from their teachers. This paper is an attempt to investigate the efficacy of explicit instruction of refusal at pragmatic level to four types of acts- invitations, suggestions, offers and requests. Adopting a pretest/posttest design as with treatment and control group, the two groups in this study were exposed to the treatment. Data collected by means of written Discourse Completion Test (DCT) as well as written self report suggest that the instructional approach resulted in gain in L2 pragmatic ability of the experimental group. The delayed posttest used in the study confirmed the findings. The findings may contribute to the interlanguage pragmatic pedagogy, especially in the EFL context and suggest that meta-pragmatic information the L2 learners received through pedagogy may lead to learners' L2 pragmatic development.",56072904,10.4304/JLTR.3.4.814-821,
J. Sykes,2011,Multi-User Virtual Environments: User-Driven Design and Implementation for Language Learning,"The design, implementation, and evaluation of any new learning innovation require thoughtful, context-based inquiry to inform both theory and practice. This is especially true in the case of emergent technological tools, which often have a profound impact on social and professional practices (Brown & Adler, 2008; Thorne, 2000; Thorne & Payne, 2005). Witness, for example, the explosion of Twitter as a critically important social networking site1 or the rapid increase of people who regularly interact with, and within, multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs). Concurrent with transitions in social and professional contexts, we have witnessed a notable increased interest in the use of MUVEs for educational purposes (de Freitas, 2006; Prensky, 2001; Sawyer & Smith, 2008).

"M. Swain, Sharon Lapkin",2001,Focus on form through collaborative dialogue: Exploring task effects,"In our recent research we have been using tasks as a stimulus for generating talk among students (Swain and Lapkin, 1998). We have been interested in discovering whether, through output (the activities of talking and/or writing), learners notice gaps in their linguistic knowledge, triggering an analysis of input or of existing internal resources to fill those gaps (Swain and Lapkin, 1995); whether learners' output serves as a hypothesis of how to convey their intended meaning (Swain, 1995); and whether learners use language to reflect on their own (or their interlocutors') language use that is, whether learners externalise their hypotheses about form and meaning, exposing those hypotheses to scrutiny and discussion (Swain, 1998; 2000). Our research has involved a search for tasks that will generate this sort of student talk with the goal of demonstrating its relationship to second language learning. The tasks we have used to generate such talk engage students in linguistic problem solving, are done collaboratively, and involve the production of a spoken and written text. Studies such as those of Donate (1994), LaPierre (1994; see also Swain, 1998), Swain and Lapkin (1998) and Tse (1996) suggest that the talk which surfaces when students collaborate in solving linguistic problems encountered m communicative task performance represents second language learning in progress. In these studies, later language use has been traced back to dialogue occurring as the students worked collaboratively to express their intended meaning and carry out the task at hand. In these dialogic exchanges related to their ongoing language use, noticing, hypothesis formulation, and hypothesis testing have been observed to have taken place. These studies have relied on pedagogical tasks to serve as the stimulus to collaborative dialogue (Swain, 1997a). One of the main rationales offered in the literature for using communicative tasks in language teaching is that second language acquisition is enhanced through the negotiation of meaning: '. . . language learning is assisted through the social interaction of learners and their interlocutors, particularly when they Negotiate toward mutual comprehension of each other's message meaning'",55140666,10.4324/9781315838267-14,
"Kristine Billmyer, Manka M. Varghese",2000,Investigating instrument-based pragmatic variability: effects of enhancing discourse completion tests,"A significant dilemma in sociolinguistic research concerns the methods used to collect data, the validity of different types of data and, '…their adequacy to approximate the authentic performance of linguistic action' (Kasper and Dahl 1991: 215). Manes and Wolfson (1981) claimed that the most authentic data in sociolinguistic research is spontaneous speech gathered by ethnographic observation. Difficulties in relying on this method are well-documented (Blum-Kulka et al. 1989, Aston 1995) and have led to the wide use of an elicitation procedure known as the discourse completion test (DCT). Justified criticisms have been levelled at the DCT, some labelling it an instrument that limits the capturing of authentic communication, and others making it look almost obsolete. However, there are to date no other sociolinguistic data collection instruments that have as many administrative advantages as the DCT, making it, practically speaking, a resource pragmatics testing and teaching will continue to rely on. Furthermore, a better understanding of communication in such a constructed context may help us gain a better understanding of authentic communication. This study investigates the effect of systematic modification to DCT situational prompts used to elicit requests on the responses of native and non-native speakers of English. Modification included enhancing the situational prompts by adding information on a number of social and contextual variables considered relevant to this study. Results indicate that enhancement did not affect the request strategy or amount of internal modification. However, enhancing situational prompts did produce significantly longer, more elaborated requests in both groups. These findings point to the importance of external modification of speech act production and the need for an instrument that can satisfactorily account for both variation and context. This study has implications for both teaching and testing in interlanguage pragmatics.",145580940,10.1093/APPLIN/21.4.517,

"Yoshinori J. Fukuya, Alicia Martínez-Flor",2008,The Interactive Effects of Pragmatic-Eliciting Tasks and Pragmatic Instruction,": the effects of data-gathering methods on pragmatic data have been well documented, yet an inquiry into the interactive effects of assessment tasks with pragmatic instruction has received scant attention. This study investigated the interaction between two assessment tasks (e-mail and phone) and two types of pragmatic instruction (explicit and implicit). Forty-nine Spanish learners of English engaged in these two tasks as pre- and posttests. The explicit group received 12 hours of metapragmatic information on head acts and hedges in suggestions while the implicit group was the recipient of recast and input enhancement activities. The results showed that postin-structional improvement of the explicit condition was significantly more than that of the implicit condition in the phone task, although improvements of these two conditions were on par in the e-mail task. This task-induced variability might have been caused by an interaction between the feature of the two types of knowledge (i.e., monitoring capability) and an access to the knowledge bases (i.e., the role of attention to appropriateness and accuracy) in the two tasks.",143824915,10.1111/J.1944-9720.2008.TB03308.X,
"Kenneth R. Rose, Connie Ng Kwai-fun",2001,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: Inductive and deductive teaching of compliments and compliment responses,"Introduction This chapter reports the results of a study on the effects of inductive and deductive approaches to instruction in pragmatics, with the target features being compliments and compliment responses. The literature on these speech acts – along with that on requests and apologies – is among the richest in crosscultural and interlanguage pragmatics, offering coverage of both pragmalinguistics and sociopragmatics. Compliments and compliment responses were also among the first speech acts to be targeted for empirically informed teaching of pragmatics (Holmes & Brown, 1987), as well as for the study of the effects of instruction in interlanguage pragmatics (Billmyer, 1990a, 1990b). The current study incorporates aspects of each of these lines of inquiry, but adds several elements, namely, the two instructional approaches and the foreign language context. Background We will not provide a detailed survey of the literature on the effects of instruction in pragmatics, or on issues such as explicit and implicit learning, both of which receive comprehensive coverage in Bardovi- Harlig (this volume) and Kasper (this volume). We will, however, discuss in brief some of the relevant literature on compliments and compliment responses, the effects of instruction in compliments and compliment responses, and inductive and deductive approaches to teaching. Research on compliments is largely traced back to the work of Nessa Wolfson and Joan Manes (Wolfson & Manes, 1980; Manes & Wolfson, 1981; Wolfson, 1981a, 1981b, 1983, 1984, 1988, 1989a; Manes, 1983), which provided the first comprehensive description of the formulaicity of compliments in American English.",142541504,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.013,
Naoko Taguchi,2011,Teaching Pragmatics: Trends and Issues,"Theoretical, empirical, and practical interest in pragmatic competence and development for second language (L2) learners has resulted in a large body of literature on teaching L2 pragmatics. This body of literature has diverged into two major domains: (a) a group of experimental studies directly testing the efficacy of various instructional methods in pragmatics learning and (b) research that explores optimal instructional practice and resources for pragmatic development in formal classroom settings. This article reviews literature in these two domains and aims at providing a collective view of the available options for pragmatics teaching and the ways that pragmatic development can best be promoted in the classroom. In the area of instructional intervention, this article reviews studies under the common theoretical second language acquisition paradigms of explicit versus implicit instruction, input processing instruction, and skill acquisition and practice. In the area of classroom practice and resources, three domains of research and pedagogical practices are reviewed: material development and teacher education, learner strategies and autonomous learning, and incidental pragmatics learning in the classroom. Finally, this article discusses unique challenges and opportunities that have been embraced by pragmatics teaching in the current era of poststructuralism and multiculturalism.",145372095,10.1017/S0267190511000018,
J. Sykes,2013,Synchronous CMC and Pragmatic Development: Effects of Oral and Written Chat,"This study systematically examines the strength of the connection between synchronous CMC and pragmatic instruction by measuring the effects of three types of synchronous group discussion (written chat [WC], oral chat [OC], and traditional face-to-face [FF] discussion) on the acquisition of the speech act (refusals of an invitation) in the target language. Zhao (2003) notes that CMC research is limited in terms of investigating the effects these types of discussions have on other features of language development. Even so, the existing research indicates a positive connection between the use of written chat and oral production (e.g., Healy-Beauvois, 1997; Payne & Whitney, 2002). However, no other investigations specifically address the effects of CMC (written or oral) on pragmatic acquisition. In this study, two classes of third-semester Spanish students (N = 27) participated in small group discussions as well as pre and post role-play tasks that elicited the invitation refusal. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of these role plays illustrate that synchronous discussion type does have an effect on pragmatic development. The WC groups outperformed the others in terms of both complexity and variety of strategies used. A discussion of the results and implications for future research and pedagogy is included.",10464205,10.1558/CJ.V22I3.399-431,

This article reviews current trends in the use of mediated communication and offers a vision for near-future second and foreign language (L2) learning that utilizes emerging media as (a) meaningful contexts for L2 language development and (b) a means for adding real world relevance to in-class uses of internet-mediated communication tools. In this article, we first explore a sampling of Web 2.0 technologies (e.g., blogs, wikis, and social bookmarking) related to collaborative content building and dissemination of information. We then consider three types of 3-dimensional virtual environments, including open social virtualities (such as Second Life and There), massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) (e.g., World of Warcraft, Everquest, and Eve Online), and synthetic immersive environments (SIEs, i.e., visually rendered spaces which combine aspects of open social virtualities with goal-directed gaming models to address specific learning objectives). In particular, we report on SIEs as they might be used to foster interlanguage pragmatic development and briefly report on an existing project in this area. The ultimate goal is to spark future research and pedagogical innovation in these areas of emerging digital media in order to arrive at a greater understanding of the complexities involved in their integration with language learning in ways that will be most relevant to the communicative contexts of the 21st century.",18133430,10.11139/CJ.25.3.528-546,

N. Ellis,2006,Language Acquisition as Rational Contingency Learning,"This paper considers how fluent language users are rational in their language processing, their unconscious language representation systems optimally prepared for comprehension and production, how language learners are intuitive statisticians, and how acquisition can be understood as contingency learning. But there are important aspects of second language acquisition that do not appear to be rational, where input fails to become intake. The paper describes the types of situation where cognition deviates from rationality and it introduces how the apparent irrationalities of L2 acquisition result from standard phenomena of associative learning as encapsulated in the models of Rescorla and Wagner (1972) and Cheng and Holyoak (1995), which describe how cue salience, outcome importance, and the history of learning from multiple probabilistic cues affect the development of ‘learned selective attention’ and transfer. This article considers how fluent language users are rational in their language processing, rational in the sense that their unconscious language representation systems are optimally prepared for comprehension and production. In this view, language learners are intuitive statisticians, weighing the likelihoods of interpretations and predicting which constructions are likely in the current context, and language acquisition is contingency learning, that is the gathering of information about the relative frequencies of form‐function mappings. These arguments are well supported by the psycholinguistic evidence relating to first language. But there are important aspects of second language acquisition that do not appear to accord with this characterization, those aspects where despite massive experience of naturalistic input and usage, the system fails to become optimally tuned to represent the second language forms, their functions, and their contextualized likelihoods of occurrence. The article builds the framework for an explanation of the seeming irrationalities of L2 acquisition in terms of standard phenomena of associative learning involving ‘learned selective attention.’ In order to place L1 and L2 in the context of a rational analysis of language learning, I first illustrate the problem by considering the design of word processors of a more mechanical kind than is the ultimate goal of our inquiry. Having thus set a concrete stage, I outline the process of the rational analysis of learning and memory (Anderson 1989, 1991b; Anderson and Milson 1989; Anderson and Schooler 2000). Next I describe some statistical",8041811,10.1093/APPLIN/AMI038,

Over four consecutive days, an input group (n = 17) and an output group (n = 17) practiced using target request-making forms via computerized input-based and output-based practice activities, respectively. Meanwhile, a control group (n = 15) did Chinese reading comprehension exercises that did not contain the target pragmatic features. Two computerized instruments (a pragmatic listening judgment task and an oral discourse completion task) were administered to assess pragmatic development over time.

E. A. Soler,2012,Teachability and bilingualism effects on third language learners' pragmatic knowledge,"The present study focuses on the benefits that teaching the speech act of refusal from a discourse perspective can have on third language learners’ pragmatic knowledge. Additionally, it also explores whether receptive and productive bilinguals resort to pragmalinguistic, sociopragmatic and linguistic information in different ways during the planning and execution of refusals in English. Ninety-two students of English (52 receptive bilinguals and 40 productive bilinguals of Catalan and Spanish) participated in the study, which involved a one-group pre-test/post-test design and an instructional treatment. Retrospective verbal reports were used to examine the information attended to during the pre-test and post-test role-plays, that is to say, before and after receiving instruction on refusals. Research findings showed that both receptive and productive bilinguals increased their attention and pragmalinguistic awareness of refusals in English, but the latter seemed to display a higher degree of metapragmatic awareness. In addition, productive bilinguals showed higher communicative sensitivity, mainly in the form of concern for the interlocutor’s feelings, and a conversational approach that can be defined as hearer-oriented. Findings of the study add new insights on how bilingualism may influence third language pragmatic learning in instructional settings.",54182181,10.1515/IP-2012-0028,

We created pre- and post-instruction videos of a native speaker (NS) and non-native speakers (NNSs) in simulated job interviews. Initial interviews were examined for pragmatic difficulties, and one of the researchers also conducted pre- and post-interviews with the recruiters and the NNSs to obtain reactions to the interviews. Their initial videos and post-interview reactions were used to instruct the NNSs in the pragmatics of a job interview. A panel of three expert instructors also watched the pre- and post-instruction videos and rated all interviews on an inventory of specific pragmatic skills. Their ratings were analyzed to determine the candidates' progress and patterns of pragmatic difficulties. Candidates showed marked improvement in their second interviews, demonstrating that the pedagogical intervention used promoted the development of pragmatic competence.

Youjin Kim,2012,"TASK COMPLEXITY, LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES, AND KOREAN EFL LEARNERS’ QUESTION DEVELOPMENT","Building on the cognitive and interactive perspectives of task research, the cognition hypothesis states that increasing task complexity promotes greater interaction and feedback and thus facilitates second language (L2) development (Robinson, 2001b, 2007a). To date, very little research has explored this claim during learner-learner interactions in English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom contexts in which a task-based syllabus is implemented. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of task complexity on the occurrence of interaction-driven learning opportunities and question development in such a classroom context. Korean university students (N = 191) from four intact English classes were randomly assigned to one comparison group and three experimental groups with various task-complexity levels (i.e., simple, +complex, and ++complex) based on Robinson’s framework. Their interactions were audiorecorded, and occurrences of learning opportunities, operationalized as language-related episodes (LREs), were identified. Question development was identified between pretest and posttests on the basis of the learners’ stage advancement using Pienemann and Johnston’s (1987) developmental sequence. Results indicated that more complex tasks promoted a greater number of LREs and particularly led to LREs targeting developmentally advanced question structures, which result in question development.",143958430,10.1017/S0272263112000368,

R. Young,1999,SOCIOLINGUISTIC APPROACHES TO SLA,"The study of second language acquisition involves understanding what bilinguals know about their second language and how they acquire and use it. Because acquisition and use occur in a social context, it is important for second–language acquisition researchers to understand the ways in which social context and the acquisition and use of a second language are related. In recent years, our understanding of language as a social phenomenon has increased greatly. In a recent survey of sociolinguistics and language teaching, McKay and Hornberger (1996) divide the field into four related areas: 1) studies of language and society–how large–scale social and political issues affect language use in a particular society, 2) studies of language variation—how the “same” language varies from speaker to speaker, from place to place, and from situation to situation, 3) studies of language and interaction—how language is used in face–to–face communication, and 4) studies of language and culture—how particular cultures privilege some kinds of language over others.",9467452,10.1017/S0267190599190068,

R. Lyster,2004,DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF PROMPTS AND RECASTS IN FORM-FOCUSED INSTRUCTION,"Four teachers and their eight classes of 179 fifth-grade (10–11-year-old) students participated in this quasi-experimental classroom study, which investigated the effects of form-focused instruction (FFI) and corrective feedback on immersion students' ability to accurately assign grammatical gender in French. The FFI treatment, designed to draw attention to selected noun endings that reliably predict grammatical gender and to provide opportunities for practice in associating these endings with gender attribution, was implemented in the context of regular subject-matter instruction by three of the four teachers, each with two classes, for approximately 9 hours during a 5-week period, while the fourth teacher taught the same subject matter without FFI to two comparison classes. Additionally, each of the three FFI teachers implemented a different feedback treatment: recasts, prompts, or no feedback. Analyses of pretest, immediate-posttest, and delayed-posttest results showed a significant increase in the ability of students exposed to FFI to correctly assign grammatical gender. Results of the written tasks in particular, and to a lesser degree the oral tasks, revealed that FFI is more effective when combined with prompts than with recasts or no feedback, as a means of enabling L2 learners to acquire rule-based representations of grammatical gender and to proceduralize their knowledge of these emerging forms.This study was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (nos. 410-98-0175 and 410-2002-0988).

Taking Kasper and Schmidt's argument one step further, this article shows how interlanguage itself has been ignored in research on interlanguage pragmatics. Research has not established that pragmatic competence is independent of grammatical competence. Although grammatical competence may not be a sufficient condition for pragmatic development, it may be a necessary condition.

It is hypothesized that such instruction raises learners' awareness of the functions and contextual distributions of routines, enabling them to become more pragmatically fluent. Two versions of a communication course taught to advanced German learners of English for 14 weeks are examined, one version providing explicit metapragmatic information, the other withholding it. Samples of tape-recorded conversations at various stages of the courses are used to assess how students' pragmatic fluency developed and whether and how the development of fluency benefits from metapragmatic awareness.",141662199,10.1017/S0272263100014893,

Specifically, this study assesses the degree to which Korean ESL (English as a second language) students' preferences for North American English influence their willingness to use Australian-English routines while studying in Australia. Research suggests that attitudinal factors in high-proficiency students can affect second language (L2) pragmatic production in important ways, students at times rejecting or resisting undesirable L2 pragmatic forms (Cohen, 1997; Hinkel, 1996; LoCastro, 2001; Siegal, 1995, 1996). Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from a group of 20 Korean ESL students studying at language institutes and universities around Melbourne. Findings suggest that there is some avoidance of Australian routines by Korean ESL learners and that this avoidance represents resistance to Australian-English pragmatic norms.",145559691,10.1111/J.1467-9922.2007.00430.X,

R. Ellis,2000,Task-based research and language pedagogy,"Two very different theoretical accounts of task-based language use and learning are critiqued and their relevance for language pedagogy discussed. One account, which will be referred to as the psycholinguistic perspective, draws on a computational model of second language (L2) acquisition (Lantolf, 1996). According to this perspective, tasks are viewed as devices that provide learners with the data they need for learning; the design of a task is seen as potentially determining the kind of language use and opportunities for learning that arise.Three different psycholinguistic models are discussed: Long’s Interaction Hypothesis, Skehan’s ‘cognitive approach’ and Yule’s framework of communicative efficiency. The second theoretical account of tasks is that provided by socio-cultural theory. This is premised on the claim that participants co-construct the ‘activity’ they engage in when performing a task, in accordance with their own socio-history and locally determined goals, and that, therefore, it is difficult to make reliable predictions regarding the kinds of language use and opportunities for learning that will arise. Socio-cultural theory emphasizes the dialogic processes (such as ‘scaffolding’) that arise in a task performance and how these shape language use and learning. Both theoretical approaches afford insights that are of value to task-based language pedagogy. The psycholinguistic approach provides information that is of importance for planning task-based teaching and learning. The socio-cultural approach illuminates the kinds of improvisation that teachers and learners need to engage in during task-based activity to promote communicative efficiency and L2 acquisition.",144923919,10.1177/136216880000400302,

The researchers investigated the effect of interaction with expert German speakers combined with an instructional intervention focusing on pragmatic competence on the development of learners' ability to communicate in a second language (L2) professional register. The data reveal a positive effect on the strategic use of modal verbs for expressing polite requests as well as a moderate effect on learners' use of the subjunctive mood to establish social distance.

The data are drawn from 55 L2 learners of Japanese at a beginning level of proficiency in an Australian tertiary institution. Five different types of interactional moves made by native speaker interlocutors during task-based interaction were identified, by way of which learners received implicit negative feedback and positive evidence about the two target structures. The relative frequency of each interactional move type was calculated, and associated changes in the learners' performance on immediate and delayed posttests were examined. It was found that, although native speaker interactional moves containing positive evidence about the two target structures were 10 times more frequent during task-based language learning than those containing implicit negative feedback, only learners who had an above-average score on the pretest benefited from the positive evidence provided. Implicit negative feedback, on the other hand, had beneficial effects on short-term development of the grammatical targets regardless of the learner's current mastery of the target structures. Moreover, recasts were found to have a larger impact than other conversational moves on short-term L2 grammatical development.",146567209,10.1017/S0272263103000019,
Satomi Takahashi,2001,Pragmatics in Language Teaching: The role of input enhancement in developing pragmatic competence,"Introduction Input enhancement in second language acquisition (SLA) has been addressed in studies of form-focused instruction at morphosyntactic levels, known as Focus on Form (FonF) research (e.g., White, Spada, Lightbown & Ranta, 1991; Carroll, Swain & Roberge, 1992; Fotos, 1993; Spada & Lightbown, 1993; Trahey & White, 1993; see Doughty & Williams, 1998; Long & Robinson, 1998, for an overview). Following Sharwood Smith's (1991, 1993) definition of input enhancement, researchers experimentally manipulated instructional input on L2 structures in various ways: some form of corrective feedback with or without metalinguistic information (e.g., Doughty & Varela, 1998), visual enhancement (textual modification) with the use of bold or italic face (e.g., Alanen, 1995; Jourdenais, Ota, Stauffer, Boyson, & Doughty, 1995; J. White, 1998), and task manipulation directing learners to notice and attend to target structures (e.g., Hulstijn, 1989; Robinson, 1996; Williams & Evans, 1998). All of these studies provided evidence that high levels of attention-drawing activities, as represented by presenting metalinguistic information and corrective feedback, are more helpful for learners in gaining the mastery of target-language structures than simple exposure to positive evidence. These findings thus provide the basis for theoretical verification of Schmidt's (1993a, 1995, 1998) Noticing Hypothesis, which states that conscious noticing is the necessary and sufficient condition for converting input to intake. In contrast to the rich array of input enhancement research into morphosyntactic features, there have been considerably fewer studies specifically focusing on the role of input enhancement in developing L2 pragmatic competence.",142737322,10.1017/CBO9781139524797.014,

In this paper I argue that pragmatic failure is an area of cross-cultural communication breakdown which has received very little attention from language teachers. I suggest that there is one area of pragmatic failure ('pragmalinguistic failure') which is fairly easy to overcome. It is simply a question of highly conventionalized usage which can be taught quite straightforwardly as 'part of the grammar'. The second area ('sociopragmatic failure') is much more difficult to deal with, since it involves the student's system of beliefs as much as his/her knowledge of the language. I argue that it is essential to avoid prescriptivism in this very sensitive area of language in use. To do so we must draw on insights from theoretical pragmatics and develop ways of heightening and refining students' metapragmatic awareness, so that they are able to express themselves as they choose.",35667508,10.1093/APPLIN/4.2.91,

This study, based in part on previous research by Wildner-Bassett (1984), examined (1) whether gambit use in Spanish can be taught effectively in the classroom, allowing the student to use gambits appropriately in unplanned speech; (2) how the type of interactional situation (a friendly discussion versus a complaint) affects the production of gambits; and (3) what types of gambits show the greastest increases in use for each interactional situation. Participants were intermediate students. A repeated-measures design was used. Results suggest that students can be taught to use gambits effectively and appropriately in the classroom. In addition, the nature of the interactional situation seemed to make a difference in the ability of the students to produce gambits in spontaneous interaction and in the types of gambits they produced.",143620899,10.1111/J.1944-9720.2002.TB03153.X,

M. Takimoto,2008,The Effects of Deductive and Inductive Instruction on the Development of Language Learners' Pragmatic Competence,"The present study investigated the effects of deductive and inductive teaching approaches to the acquisition of pragmatic competence on learners of English as a foreign language. In this study, 60 adult native speakers of Japanese with intermediate-level proficiency in English were each randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups, which consisted of 3 treatment groups and 1 control group. Each treatment group received one of the following kinds of instruction in English pragmatics: (a) deductive instruction, (b) inductive instruction with problem-solving tasks, or (c) inductive instruction with structured input tasks. Both the deductive and inductive approaches constituted different types of explicit input-based instruction. The purpose was to teach the learners how to use lexical/phrasal downgraders and syntactic downgraders in English to perform complex requests. All participants completed a pretest, a posttest, and a follow-up test. Each test included 2 receptive judgment tasks and 2 production tasks. The 3 treatment groups performed significantly better than the control group (p < .006). However, for the listening test, only the participants in the deductive instruction group showed a reduction in the positive effects of the treatment between the posttest and the follow-up test.",144648631,10.1111/J.1540-4781.2008.00752.X,

E. A. Soler,2008,Investigating pragmatic language learning in foreign language classrooms,"Abstract A lot of research addressing learners' development of pragmatics has recently been conducted (Kasper and Schmidt 1996; Bardovi-Harlig, 2002; Kasper and Rose 2002). From this same approach, a review of theoretical perspectives on pragmatic learning and how they have been operationalised in interlanguage pragmatic research is presented. Second, by paying attention to studies on learning the speech act of requesting that have been conducted in the EFL classroom, the author addresses the issue of whether cognitive and socially-oriented theories are complementary and, if so, how they can be integrated into classroom research on pragmatics. Taking into account the debate between positivism and relativism in SLA theory construction, here the author suggests relativism as a viable paradigm in research on interlanguage pragmatics. At the same time, language classrooms are presented as settings where cognitive and socially-oriented approaches can merge, and new perspectives on investigating pragmatic learning in foreign language contexts arc discussed.",143143154,10.1515/IRAL.2008.008,
