"Dewaele, Jean-Marc",2008,The emotional weight of I love you in multilinguals’ languages,"The present paper considers the perceived emotional weight of the phrase I love you in multilinguals’ different languages. The sample consists of 1459 adult multilinguals speaking a total of 77 different first languages. They filled out an on-line questionnaire with open and closed questions linked to language behavior and emotions. Feedback on the open question related to perceived emotional weight of the phrase I love you in the multilinguals’ different languages was recoded in three categories: it being strongest in (1) the first language (L1), (2) the first language and a foreign language, and (3) a foreign language (LX). A majority of speakers felt I love you was strongest in their L1. Participants offered various explanations for their perception. Statistical analyses revealed that the perception of weight of the phrase I love you was associated with self-perceived language dominance, context of acquisition of the L2, age of onset of learning the L2, degree of socialization in the L2, nature of the network of interlocutors in the L2, and self-perceived oral proficiency in the L2.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2008.03.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216608000507,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

Data were collected via Web-based questionnaires. Participants were divided into three groups based on their trait EI scores (low, average, high). Nonparametric statistical analyses revealed a consistent pattern of results across languages and situations. Higher levels of trait EI corresponded to significantly lower CA/FLA scores. Participants who started learning the second and third languages at a younger age also suffered less from FLA. Purely classroom-based language instruction was found to be linked to higher levels of FLA compared to instruction that also involved extracurricular use of the language. The knowledge of more languages, a higher frequency of use, a stronger socialization in a language, a larger network of interlocutors, and a higher level of self-perceived proficiency in a language were also linked to lower levels of CA/FLA.",,10.1111/j.1467-9922.2008.00482.x,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2008.00482.x,manual_search[language_learning]

This study explores the relationship between the grammatical and pragmatic competence of Japanese L2 learners by examining their use of such self-qualification in a corpus of oral proficiency interviews. It demonstrates that successful self-qualification is achieved not only by the placement of appropriate connective expressions but also through effective use of foregrounding and/or backgrounding discourse mechanisms. The results indicate a close relationship between pragmatic, grammatical, and discourse competence in learner language.",,10.1111/j.1467-9922.2007.00419.x,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2007.00419.x,manual_search[language_learning]

Focusing on first and second person subjects, the current study details the role of their overt use in conversations, and shows that in addition to the function in discourse contexts, such as ‘contrastiveness’ and ‘emphasis’, the overt expression of first and second person subjects is a useful tool to index the speaker's social relationship with the other participant, such as social difference or intimacy. This is particularly important for a group of pro-drop languages like Japanese and Korean, in which the expression of difference is the norm and a variety of personal references play a significant role in expressing such difference, as well as intimacy.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2007.06.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216607001099,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

Cross-sectional data were collected from 120 learners of second language Korean using a sentence interpretation task and a guided picture description task. The results support our hypothesized acquisition route of imperfective markers, establishing dynamic durativity as the prototypical meaning of the Korean imperfective -ko iss- and suggesting individual variation in expanding the prototype.",,10.1111/j.1467-9922.2007.00431.x,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2007.00431.x,manual_search[language_learning]

Outcomes of these treatments were compared with the effects of non-enhanced interaction in a quasi-experimental study involving 91 Japanese EFL learners.

This paper investigates the role of interactional routines in the socialization of L2 interactional competence via analysis of 15 hours of foreign language classroom data. Results reveal that active and peripheral participation in the routines of the classroom shapes learner ability to use the follow-up turn of the IRF routine to perform assessments and other expressions responsive to their interlocutor's utterances. Instances in which teachers explicitly guide learners in the expression of alignment are rare. In teacher-fronted contexts, learners are guided to be responsive to teacher questions, and have little opportunity for expression of alignment, including assessments. Learner assessments, when they occur in teacher-fronted contexts, have particular sequential consequences, triggering extended assessment activity by the teacher. The teachers' language incorporates various follow-up turn expressions during interaction with students. Longitudinal analysis of learner language during pair-work reveals an increase in learner use of follow-up expressions, including assessments, evidencing the socializing power of both active and peripheral participation in the interactional routines of the classroom.",,10.1016/S0378-2166(98)00115-5,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216698001155,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Pyun, Danielle Ooyoung Kim, Jung Sup Cho, Hyun Yong Lee, Jung Hee",2014,Impact of affective variables on Korean as a foreign language learners' oral achievement,"While research on affective variables abounds in the foreign and second language acquisition literature, few studies have examined the role that learner affect plays in learning a less commonly taught language (LCTL) such as Korean. This study examines potential relationships between affective variables (i.e., motivation, anxiety, linguistic self-confidence, and risk-taking) and oral achievement in a KFL (Korean as a Foreign Language) North American college classroom setting. The results showed that learners' achievement was positively correlated with linguistic self-confidence and risk-taking while negatively associated with anxiety. A positive correlation was also found between motivation and linguistic self-confidence. Anxiety was negatively correlated with linguistic self-confidence and risk-taking. Among the four affective variables investigated, only risk-taking was identified as a significant predictor of student achievement in oral skills. Findings suggest that (1) learners' affective states play a significant role in learning an L2 that is non-cognate with and distant from their L1 and (2) effortful and frequent attempts of risk-taking should be particularly emphasized to enhance learners' achievement in L2 oral proficiency.",,10.1016/j.system.2014.09.017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X1400150X,manual_search[system]

"Yoshimi, Dina Rudolph",1999,L1 language socialization as a variable in the use of ne by L2 learners of Japanese,"Studies of L1 communicative competence within the framework of language socialization have recognized the rich interplay of linguistic knowledge and sociocultural knowledge in the process of language socialization. Following this research tradition, some studies of L2 acquisition have begun to conceptualize this process as one of secondary socialization. This study argues that the language socialization framework also provides rich opportunities for the detailed, qualitative study of learner production, and of the role of the learner's L1 socialization on this production. A study of English-speaking learners' anomalous uses of the Japanese particle ne in their L2 production of Japanese, which takes into account the distinct communicative styles of the target language (L2) and the learners' base language (L1), is undertaken. Using qualitative discourse analysis, the learners' use of ne in talk with native speaker conversation partners is shown to be influenced by L1 culturally-ordered epistemic constraints, as well as by L1 discourse practices pertaining to stances of sharedness. The contribution of the language socialization framework, applied in combination with qualitative, discourse analytic methods, to the study of L2 learner production is discussed in conjunction with the findings. The importance of considering the role of affective and epistemic dimensions of communication in the study of L2 learner production is highlighted.",,10.1016/S0378-2166(98)00111-8,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216698001118,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
