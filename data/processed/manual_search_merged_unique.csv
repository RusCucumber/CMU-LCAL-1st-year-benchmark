"Aarne, Päivikki Tallberg, Ing-Mari",2010,Visual check back in children with Specific Language Impairment,"Sensitivity to eye gaze is suggested to be an important prerequisite for intersubjectivity and for normal language development. The present study investigated visual check back in two age groups of typically developed children and one group of children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI, n=10). The control children were matched to the SLI children with regard to language level (LMC, n=10) and to age (AMC, n=10). Play setting situations, including child and teacher, were designed to elicit the children's use of visual check back. The children with lower language level (SLI children aged 5:0 and LMC children aged 2:1) gave visual check back significantly more seldom than the higher language level children (aged 5:1) and they also needed more time for giving check back, i.e. there is a relation between visual check back and language level. The results indicate that children with SLI have a deviant visual communication that further worsens their already limited communicative ability.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037821661000113X,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Abdi, Reza Rizi, Manoochehr Tavangar Tavakoli, Mansoor",2010,The cooperative principle in discourse communities and genres: A framework for the use of metadiscourse,"Developments in characterizing discourse communities and their various genres are hoped to provide more insight into the nature of language in use. Such characterizations gradually tend to include the rhetorical and less visible aspects of different genres in different discourse communities. The trend seems rewarding due to the multilingual membership in discourse communities and inevitability of interference from speech communities. Although several studies have tried to describe the distribution and nature of metadiscourse marking across disciplines and languages, no systematic attempt was made, to our knowledge, to introduce a practical model that presumably guides the users in the real time of writing. By analyzing metadiscourse samples from the genre of research article of academic discourse community, this study embarks on introducing a tentative model based on Gricean cooperative principle (CP) that is hoped to help the multilingual members of academic discourse community in the use of metadiscourse markers. The Gricean categories of CP, developed here, are hoped to provide a practical framework that informs how to use rather than how is it used of metadiscourse in writing research articles. Such a model can be assumed an improvement against coarse-grained holistic guides for the use of metadiscourse offered by previous studies. The attempt also led to a new classification of metadiscourse and added two new metadiscourse strategies of collapsers and disclaimers.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.11.001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002811,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Agustín Llach, M. Pilar",2010,Lexical gap-filling mechanisms in foreign language writing,"The present paper intends to investigate the lexical gap-filling behaviour of primary and secondary Spanish learners of English. When there is a mismatch between the learners lexical knowledge and their communicative needs, then a lexical gap arises. Learners resort to different mechanisms to compensate for that lack of lexical knowledge. Basically, we distinguish among several L1- and L2-based mechanisms. We analysed the lexical gap-filling behaviour of 203 learners in their written compositions. We collected data when students were in 4th grade of Primary Education and four years later when they were in 8th grade. Results revealed that as learners progress in their learning of the foreign language they gradually abandon use of the L1 and substitute L1-based mechanisms such as borrowings, coinages and calques by other L2-based ones such as semantic and formal approximations, circumlocutions, and use of general words. We observed that L2 proficiency interrelates with L1 and L2 influence in different ways depending on the specific mechanism used, so that some mechanisms which are frequent at 4th grade decrease their presence, basically borrowing, and some other tend to increase, basically L2-based mechanisms as linguistic proficiency, awareness and cognitive development increase.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.09.009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10001090,manual_search[system]

This initial model was then operationalized in an instrument consisting of 42 items, i.e. 7 behavioral items for each component. The piloting and testing of the tentative model through exploratory and confirmatory data analyses on a sample of 300 ESL teachers reduced the instrument to 29 items, removing the “morality” factor, and reducing the items in the “affective” factor to half.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.03.003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000230,manual_search[system]

This study investigates the relationship between vocabulary size and depth for Iranian learners of English for specific/academic purposes (ESP/EAP). The participants include 112 ESP graduate students at a university in Iran. The findings from linear regression analyses show that, overall, VLT (size test) and WAT (depth test) have a great deal of common shared variance for these participants (R2=.746). However, when they were divided into low and high proficiency groups, based on whether the participants mastered the most frequent 2000 words in VLT, a substantial amount of shared variance was shown for the low group (R2=.464) and a much higher one for the high group (R2=.804). The findings suggest that vocabulary size and depth might be accounted for by the same factors, especially as the learners’ proficiency increases.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.06.013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000795,manual_search[system]

"Alejo, Rafael",2010,Where does the money go?

The present paper attempts to bring together the two perspectives to analyze the CONTAINER metaphor in economics textbooks. Thus, the identification and analysis of highly metaphorical terms of the discipline will serve to determine the conceptual areas in which metaphor plays an important role, whereas a textual analysis will demonstrate how this metaphorical content is laid out for novice readers in the discourse of the introductory textbook. This article suggests that the CONTAINER metaphor is a rhetorical device, like the passive voice or hypotheticality, used to convey the idea of depersonalization and objectification.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.08.013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037821660900229X,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Archakis, Argiris Tsakona, Villy",2010,"‘The wolf wakes up inside them, grows werewolf hair and reveals all their bullying’: The representation of parliamentary discourse in Greek newspapers","The present paper investigates how journalists create dialogical networks involving parliamentary discourse and newspaper articles via the reproduction of extracts coming from MPs’ speeches. Drawing on critical discourse analysis and assuming that news is a value-laden construction of facts through language, a comparative analysis of parliamentary proceedings and related newspaper articles is conducted. The articles collected cover a specific parliamentary debate on a particularly ‘hot’ issue in Greek society, namely a new bill introducing the interview as part of the procedure for the selection and recruitment of civil servants. The analysis shows that the facts reported seem to be selected not on the basis of their political or legal significance, but on the basis of their unusual consequences on parliamentary procedures. Special emphasis is given to the reconstruction of direct speech in newspaper narratives and to the use of metaphor as a conversational resource employed by MPs and reproduced by journalists in an attempt to attract their readers’ interest and arouse their emotions. Rather than informing the public on the actual parliamentary work, journalists mostly aim at creating and/or maintaining solidarity between readers and newspapers of the same political and ideological orientation.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.08.015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002070,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Arundale, Robert B.",2010,"Constituting face in conversation: Face, facework, and interactional achievement","Face Constituting Theory addresses the question “How do participants achieve face in everyday talk?” explaining face and facework as achieved by participants engaged in face-to-face communication in situated relationships. Outlining the theory involves first sketching the Conjoint Co-constituting Model of Communication as a conceptualization of the achieving of meaning and action in interaction, and second conceptualizing face as a relational phenomenon at both culture-general and culture-specific levels. Using these conceptualizations, Face Constituting Theory explains face as participants’ interpretings of relational connectedness and separateness, conjointly co-constituted in talk/conduct-in-interaction. Face Constituting Theory adds to this explanation a new conceptualization of how of face interpretings are evaluated as threatening to, in stasis, or supportive of relationships, drawing into a single explanation the full range of observations on facework from outright face threat, through face maintenance, to outright face support. Consistent with ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, Face Constituting Theory is framed from the participant's perspective, and applying the theory in examining the achievement of face in an instance of everyday interaction both illustrates the application of the new theory in research, and indicates how it is distinct from the approaches existing theories employ in studying face and facework.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.12.021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609003373,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Bada, Erdogan",2010,Repetitions as vocalized fillers and self-repairs in English and French interlanguages,"The use of communication strategies (CS) varies among second language (L2) learners. According to research, L2 learners resort to CS in times of difficulty. These strategies are also consciously or unconsciously utilized during language learning. One common CS strategy is the use of repetition, which entails the repetition of syntactic and/or lexical items by L2 learners. In order to observe prevalence, type and systematicity of repetition, two movies were shown to non-native speakers of English (NNSE) and non-native speakers of French (NNSF). Oral comments about the movies were elicited from the participants and then analyzed with a specific focus on repeated elements. The results of this study indicate that repetitions of grammatical and/or lexical elements were made irrespective of types or word class, phrase or sentence level. Most repeated elements among NNSE were observed to be verbs, pronouns and prepositions, and among NNSF, pronouns, determiners and verbs. Repetitions were made (1) as vocalized fillers, and (2) as self-repairs. These findings have significant implications for the teaching of English and French with specific reference to L2 learners’ oral communicative competence.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.10.008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002793,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Baker, Wendy Hansen Bricker, Rachel",2010,The effects of direct and indirect speech acts on native English and ESL speakers’ perception of teacher written feedback,"This study explores how second language (L2) learners perceive indirect (hedging or indirect speech acts) and direct written teacher feedback. Though research suggests that indirect speech acts may be more difficult to interpret than direct speech acts (Champagne, 2001, Holtgraves, 1999), using indirect speech acts is often encouraged in the learning process, with the idea that it helps students discover their own errors (Ferris, 2007, Riley and Mackiewitz, 2003;). However, it may not be effective with L2 learners who often need more explicit instruction to understand how to revise their writing (Ferris, 2002). To examine the effect of different directness types on identifying requested corrections, native and non-native English-speaking university students were given two essays that contained written teacher feedback that differed in its directness. Participants were asked to identify if the teacher comments were praise or criticism. Two response times and accuracy scores were calculated: one, as participants determined if the teacher comment requested a correction and two, as participants made corrections. After each essay, participants answered additional questions regarding the written teacher feedback. Results show that directness type affected how quickly and accurately participants responded to positive and negative teacher feedback.",,10.1016/j.system.2009.12.007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X09001456,manual_search[system]

Based on the previous work regarding the use of nominalizations within academic writing (Biber, 1988, Biber et al., 1998, Guillen Galve, 1998, Charles, 2003), a question arises which this paper seeks to address. If we assume that nominalizations, to an extent, are a feature of accomplished academic writing, what are the implications for their use within each year of an undergraduate degree program—how do students develop their use of nominalizations? For purposes of addressing this question, the academic writing of six undergraduate students was analyzed throughout each year of their degree course. The six participants studied on an academic program entitled ‘Language, Literacy and Communication’ (LLC), part of the School of Education at The University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, with the results demonstrating that nominalizations do not necessarily play a prominent role within the academic writing of this community.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.08.007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002148,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Ben Maad, Mohamed Ridha",2010,Holistic and analytic processing modes in non-native learners’ performance of narrative tasks,"Cognitive psychology has gained currency in the study of second language learning with focus on how real-time language use proceeds through two main processing modes: an analytic processing (rule-based) mode and a holistic processing (lexically-based) mode (Skehan, 1998). However, to date there has been little experimental evidence to document the nature of the relationship between these two processing modes. The present paper reports on a study which was designed (i) to explore how both of these modes are represented in the oral production of non-native learners of English and (ii) to determine whether language learners switch from one mode to another in the face of increasing cognitive demands during task engagement. Participants in this study were 30 Tunisian undergraduate students of English who performed three narrative tasks along three tape-recording episodes. The analysis of the transcribed findings revealed that these participants activated their holistic processing mode for lexical retrieval at the beginning of their performance when the tasks were not demanding. However, they fell back on the analytic processing mode when faced with the increasing processing load due to time pressure and lack of planning. The results not only shed empirical light on how the extent of formulaicity in learners’ language may influence their processing decisions but also have pedagogical implications for speaking skill development.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.09.013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10001132,manual_search[system]

"Blackwell, Sarah E.",2010,Evaluation as a pragmatic act in Spanish film narratives,"This paper analyzes the use of evaluative language in twenty native Spanish speakers’ oral narrations of the pear film (Chafe, 1980) in light of Mey's (2001) proposal that pragmatic acts must be looked at from the point of view of the speaker and his/her experience and background knowledge, as well as the language used in performing the pragmatic act itself. Evaluative utterances in the narratives are viewed as instances of ‘situated speech acts’ (Mey, 2001) rendered possible on account of the speakers’ underlying assumptions and contextual factors. Analysis of the discourse reveals a tendency by some of the narrators to explicitly verbalize their points of view by sharing their thoughts about, reactions to, and appraisals of specific elements in the film. In addition, several of the speakers evaluated the behaviors of the characters in the film by passing judgment on and/or criticizing the appropriateness or correctness of their actions. Other evaluations involved the attribution of features and properties of entities that were not explicitly part of the cotext. The inclusion of these attributes, it is argued, reflects the fact that they contrasted in some way with the speaker's preconceived idea of what is expected, ordinary, or normal. This study shows how observed tendencies in the narrators’ use of evaluation are constrained by the background knowledge of the narrators and the social relationships between the narrators and the interlocutors, characterized in terms of the relationship of power and the social distance between speaker and addressee. Together, these factors make up the context in which acts of evaluation are possible and thus help define the pragmeme of evaluation.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.06.018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610001906,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

Case studies of three students learning Russian through independent study are presented to illustrate how integral the regulation of affect was to their learning experiences and choices. Regulation of affect involved cognitive appraisals of emotional antecedents and the applying of cognitive abilities to perceive, reflect on, and regulate emotions.

During a particularly intense period of transition, they confront new information and issues as they move forward into actual classroom teaching. Guided reflective journals provide pre-service teachers with the opportunity to examine their situation, looking at the various input, which allows them in turn to examine their rationale of teaching. This case study examines one pre-service teacher's initial perceptions of the teaching of writing in the second language classroom and the changes manifested as tracked through her journal entries and subsequently demonstrated in her beginning and ending teaching philosophy statements. Through constant comparison methodology, the data suggest that pre-service teachers are capable of addressing and solving problems that they encounter in their coursework which will allow them to become more effective practitioners. The implications of the study suggest that pre-service second language teachers should be encouraged to move beyond simply learning information; rather they can be guided in their reflections about what is happening to inform their developing teaching skills to the benefit of their future students.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.03.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000229,manual_search[system]
"Capone, Alessandro",2010,Barack Obama's South Carolina speech,"In this paper, I shall analyze US Presidential Barack Obama's South Carolina victory speech from the perspective of pragmemes.

As many are aware (including the journalists who report day by day on Barack Obama's achievements), Obama uses the technique of ‘personification’11Personification is an ontological metaphor in which a thing or abstraction is represented as a person. (The Economist, December 13th, 2007). When he voices an idea, he does not just expose it as if it came from himself, but gets another person (fictitious or, plausibly, real) to voice it. Since in an electoral speech, he cannot reasonably get people on stage to voice his ideas, he personifies ideas by narrating what people told him. His stories are his way of personifying his ideas. The discourse strategy he uses serves to reverse the direction of influence from the people in control to the people controlled (see Van Dijk, 2003). In this paper, I also argue that Barack Obama's speech contains echoes of Martin Luther King Jr's ‘I have a dream speech’ and that its structure is best understood in the light of Afro-American sermons.

"Chen, Rong Yang, Dafu",2010,Responding to compliments in Chinese: Has it changed?,"Compliment responding (CR) is one of the most studied speech acts in pragmatics. CR in Chinese, in particular, has enjoyed considerable attention from students of pragmatics. Chen (1993) finds that Chinese compliment responses (CRs) are characterized by rejection, whereby speakers typically denigrate the object of the compliment when they respond to compliments. Since then, studies on Chinese CRs have yielded a wide range of results, suggesting that the CR behavior of Chinese is a very complicated phenomenon, although, on the whole, rejection still seems a defining feature of Chinese CRs. In this paper, we report on a quasi-longitudinal study of CRs in Chinese. The study replicates Chen (1993), adopting the same instrument, in the same research site (Xi’an, China), with a similar subject population. Using the findings of Chen (1993) as a baseline for comparison, the study reveals drastic changes in the way Xi’an Chinese responding to compliments. That is, instead of overwhelmingly rejecting compliments as reported in Chen (1993), Xi’an Chinese are now found to overwhelmingly accept compliments. In fact, they accept compliments as much as do speakers of many Western languages such as English and German. We attribute this change to the influx of Western cultural influences that has occurred in the City of Xi’an since the early 1990s. We will also discuss the significance and implications of our work, which is possibly the first longitudinal study in pragmatics.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.12.006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609003221,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

This study compares 40 Chinese and 40 English direct-marketing sales e-mails. These 80 e-mails were randomly selected from a database of 7664 sales e-mails collected from 36 categories of recipients in Hong Kong over a six-month period. Based on a Cross-linguistic Socio-cultural Model proposed by the author, this study investigates the similarities and differences in the encoding of persuasive messages in the two corpora. It considers how far the similarities can be attributed to generic considerations, that is, to the contextual configuration of the field, mode, and tenor of the texts, as well as how far the differences can be attributed to the social and cultural contexts of those texts with regard to their audience, purpose, and content. Depending on the rhetorical goals the makers wish to achieve through these texts, the viewer–maker relationships they would like to establish, and the social and cultural contexts in which the texts unfold, the sales genre is likely to adapt in terms of its discourse strategy and textual features in today's marketplace, which is experiencing not only increased globalization, but also increased localization.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.06.012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609001556,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Cheung, Yin Ling",2010,"First publications in refereed English journals: Difficulties, coping strategies, and recommendations for student training","This research studies the first attempts by applied linguistics doctoral students in Hong Kong to publish their work in a refereed journal in English. Interviews were conducted with students to learn about their experience in the publication process. The interview data indicate that the applied linguistics doctoral students adopted specific strategies in tackling difficulties that arose in their publication efforts. The strategies included selecting areas of study which they were familiar with for their research, reading articles in past issues of targeted journals, and seeking assistance from their dissertation supervisors. All the interviewees received comprehensive comments and criticism from the reviewers and editors of English language journals, while an absence of comments was a characteristic of Chinese language journals. The doctoral students in this study felt that reviewers and editors of English language journals were sympathetic toward non-native English speaking writers with regard to their problems in grammar, language usage, and writing style. Some suggestions are made for informed teaching in EFL contexts and to better prepare applied linguistics doctoral students for effective writing for publication.",,10.1016/j.system.2009.12.012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X0900150X,manual_search[system]

Taking a discursive approach to the construction of identity as a turn-by-turn members’ achievement, we hope to add fresh insights to the rhetorical notion of ethos. More specifically, using a transcript of one of President Kennedy's meetings about the space race, we examine how Kennedy and his advisors ‘do’ identity to strategic effect. Findings indicate how Kennedy initiates the topic of geo-politics which (1) makes relevant his identity as president and evokes a domain of practice in which his voice counts and (2) evokes the ‘them and us’ polarity of the Soviet threat which allows Kennedy to speak as ‘us’, and thus with the authority of the American people. Conversely, his main advisor orients to Kennedy's identity as president, but he subverts the predicates linked with this identity to his own ends. He refers to another predicate of president, namely political vulnerability and argues that Kennedy should therefore not stake everything on getting a man on the moon before the Soviets. To increase his ‘good sense’ and counter Kennedy's deployment of political responsibilities linked to the identity of president, his advisor evokes an expert identity based on superior access to scientific knowledge.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.03.008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610000810,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Coleman, James A. Furnborough, Concha",2010,Learner characteristics and learning outcomes on a distance Spanish course for beginners,"Much Second Language Acquisition research focuses on young learners in the conventional classroom. Instructed adult learners, and in particular those who are learning at a distance, have attracted less attention. This group is substantial and growing: the Open University, the largest higher education language provider in the UK, alone recruits some 8000 language students a year. The present large-scale study was undertaken to explore the learner characteristics and learning experience of adult distance language learners at beginner level, the relationship of these factors with successful language learning, and the outcomes of face-to-face or online tuition. A longitudinal, quantitative design was adopted, involving pre-course and post-course questionnaires, and incorporating data on student profiles and learning outcomes. The questionnaire covered biographical variables, self-assessed initial proficiency, enjoyment and perceived achievement. This article profiles the learners and identifies factors related to successful distance language learning. Success is shown to relate to enjoyment and a sense of achieving goals. A comparison of results following online and face-to-face tuition demonstrates for the first time at scale that different modes of tuition do not necessarily lead to different learning outcomes: online language learning can be as effective as face-to-face teaching.",,10.1016/j.system.2009.12.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X09001407,manual_search[system]
"Corazza, Eros",2010,From Giorgione-sentences to simple sentences,"As Quine (1953) taught us, from (1) and (2) we cannot infer (3):(1)Giorgione was so-called because of his size(2)Giorgione was Barbarelli(3)Barbarelli was so-called because of his size.Why? In this paper I discuss and dismiss two possible answers. The first answer (section 1) rests on the view that in a sentence like (1)—a Giorgione-sentence—the name ‘Giorgione’ plays a dual role, i.e. it is both used and mentioned, and, since it is mentioned, it cannot be substituted salva veritate by the coreferential name ‘Barbarelli’. The second answer (section 2) dismisses the dual role of the name. It proposes the view that the name ‘Giorgione’ is picked out by the pronoun ‘so’ working like a demonstrative. In section 3 I present a plausible Perry-inspired account—i.e. I take on board Perry's distinction between an utterance's referential truth conditions and its reflexive truth conditions—which enables us to solve Frege-inspired puzzles concerning cognitive significance. Finally, in section 4, I discuss and defend the view that in a Giorgione-sentence ‘so’ works as an anaphoric pronoun coindexed with the name ‘Giorgione’. This anaphoric link and coindexation, though, appears at a reflexive level. This solution rests on the view that at the surface level the name is merely used while at the reflexive level, it is mentioned.11The picture I propose is neutral vis-à-vis any particular theory of quotation. For my argument to work, it is sufficient that the NPs appear within quotation marks at the cognitive level. I also show how the account proposed elegantly deals with so-called simple sentences of the form “Clark Kent, unlike Superman, can’t fly”, “Superman is stronger/more successful/…than Clark Kent”. In these sentences, codesignative NPs do not seem to be substitutable salva veritate. As in Giorgione-sentences, it is shown that their apparent non-substitutability is best dealt with at the reflexive level. The picture I’ll end up proposing endorses the welcome consequence that in Giorgione-sentences, unlike in simple sentences, codesignative names cannot be replaced salva veritate. Yet in simple sentences the intuitions concerning their alleged non-substitutivity are dealt with at the reflexive level. Thus, these intuitions force us neither to invoke special modes of presentation entering the proposition expressed nor to enrich our ontology and claim that coreferential names can refer to different entities in various contexts.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.06.017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609001763,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

Research carried out so far has tended to examine the effects of IWB use on teaching and learning in monolingual contexts where English is the first language for learners. The present study adds a new dimension to available work by analysing the influence of the IWB on the language use of a primary school teacher and a group of native speaker (NS) and non-native speaker (NNS) children in an English language immersion classroom. The study reveals that while the teacher used the IWB to support the children’s learning by taking advantage of multimedia presentations in Numeracy and Literacy and by creating opportunities for the children to engage in tactile interaction with the board, opportunities to participate in the dialogic interaction beyond the production of one or two word utterances were much more limited and largely restricted to the NS children in the group. Since the failure to promote verbal interaction has important implications for the NNS pupils in the class, it is suggested that teacher education programmes should focus on developing teachers’ classroom interactional competence as well as their technological skills.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.10.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X1000117X,manual_search[system]

This study investigates the use of selected discourse connectives in texts produced by companies for purposes of financial disclosure, representing a vital component of corporate communication. The analysis is based on two specially designed corpora of financial disclosure genres mediated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT): earnings presentations, i.e., oral presentations of financial results given by company executives to investment analysts via teleconferencing, and earnings releases, i.e., the written counterpart published on the Internet. Text analysis software was used to generate the quantitative profile of the discourse connectives, while follow-up qualitative analysis in the context of usage provided additional interpretive insights. Overall, the discourse connectives were found to be more frequent in the earnings presentations as compared to the earnings releases, even if they are more typically associated with written prose. Across both corpora, discourse connectives served a range of functions, often foregrounding the positive while attenuating the negative. These findings shed light on the pragmatic uses of discourse connectives by corporate speakers and writers as a way to influence the interpretation of the message, and thus succeed in achieving their professional aims.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.07.007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609001878,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Crosthwaite, Peter Robert",2014,"Definite Discourse–New Reference in L1 and L2: A Study of Bridging in Mandarin, Korean, and English","Definite expressions may be used to introduce a referent into discourse when their familiarity between speaker and listener can be inferred, a strategy known as bridging. However, for a number of reasons, bridging may be difficult to acquire compared to the acquisition of indefinite introductions for noninferable referent types, with the native language of the second language (L2) learners suggested to be a major factor influencing L2 acquisition. Two experiments were conducted into the use of bridging, using a controlled picture sequence where neutral, weakly, or strongly inferable referents were to be introduced. The first study investigated native speaker data from English, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean, and the second study focused on a cross-section of learner data from Mandarin and Korean L2 English learners from six proficiency levels ranging from A1 (Basic user) to C2 (Proficient user) of the Common European Framework. The native results show that the three languages introduce inferable referents in markedly different ways: definite articles for English, omission of numeral + classifiers before the noun for Mandarin, and with Korean making no apparent distinction for inferability in terms of noun-phrase form. The L2 results show that the acquisition of the definite article + noun construction to introduce inferable referents in L2 English occurs at lower Common European Framework levels for the Mandarin group than the Korean group. Therefore, it is claimed that Mandarin L2 English learners may have less difficulty mapping L2 syntactic form to pragmatic function in their L2 narrative production than their Korean counterparts, as a possible consequence of positive transfer from their native language.",,10.1111/lang.12062,https://doi.org/10.1111/lang.12062,manual_search[language_learning]
"Csizér, Kata Lukács, Gabriella",2010,"The comparative analysis of motivation, attitudes and selves: The case of English and German in Hungary","The research reported in this paper investigates how the motivational and attitudinal dispositions of students who learnt both English and German simultaneously at the time of data collection differ for the two foreign languages. The study is based on data gathered with the help of a standardised questionnaire from 237 16/17-year-old learners of English and German. Based on Dörnyei’s (2005) L2 Motivational System, it can be concluded that students’ Ideal L2 self proved to be the most significant component of predicting motivated learning behaviour for both English and German as a first or second foreign language. However, only English as a first foreign language (as opposed to as a second foreign language) was appraised with solely positive attitudes and dispositions by the students. For German (either first or second foreign language) and English as a second foreign language, the negative effects of the motivational dimensions related to the other foreign language cannot be neglected.

"Dickins, James",2010,"Junction in English and Arabic: Syntactic, discoursal and denotative features","Using Standard Arabic original texts and idiomatic English translations, this paper considers syntactic, discoursal and denotative similarities and differences between English and Arabic in respect of junction. In order to define the basic analytical scope, a composite definition of ‘sentence’ is developed, integrating grammatical, semantic and punctuational/intonational criteria. It is argued for both English and Arabic that the adjunction–disjunction distinction is properly syntactic, but that disjunction–coordination is perhaps better understood as a semantic cline. The relationship between thematic structure, mainness–subordination and grounding is investigated. While English typically backgrounds rhematic subordinate clauses, with disjuncts more likely to be foregrounded than adjuncts, Arabic readily allows foregrounding of rhematic subordinate clauses. The Arabic disjuncts (‘id) and (h˙ayt_) ‘since, as’ may display discoursal independence beyond that possible for a foregrounded subordinate disjunct rheme in English. While English standardly requires both main coordinate clauses to be foregrounded, Arabic allows either clause to be foregrounded or backgrounded. Denotative differences are illustrated by the greater capacity of Arabic adjunct-heads (h˙attaa) and (ila ‘an) ‘until’ for denotative independence from their main clause than English ‘until’. Discoursal and denotative factors may interact to produce Arabic coordinate-clause types which are strikingly unlike English ones.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.09.003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002306,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

Based on a self-reporting questionnaire, the responses of a graduate student population (n=469) were analyzed. The questionnaire addressed three issues: attitude toward English language and EFL studies, self-assessment of success in performing academic tasks in English, and ranking the importance of knowledge of English language areas. These issues were examined across the sample’s background variables (gender, academic department, thesis/non-thesis track, native language) and student proficiency level. The results showed that students’ attitude toward English and studying English was generally positive. Furthermore, students reported their ability in performing different tasks to be satisfactory. In addition, all students found all the areas of language knowledge to be important. Ranking of relative importance of English language areas revealed that vocabulary and oral skills were significantly more important than syntax and grammar, reading, and writing. Yet, for all issues, across background variables and level, significant differences were found. Our findings warrant a re-evaluation of the current program, but also raise questions regarding whose voices are to be considered when developing an EFL academic graduate program.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.02.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000783,manual_search[system]

These developments make it relevant to introduce approaches with a different focus as a supplement to the traditional approaches in order to achieve a fuller picture of domain-specific communication. By way of a specific example (a study of the concept Mord in Swiss criminal law), the empirical part of the paper shows which additional aspects of communication in the field of law become visible if we supplement the traditional approaches with approaches focusing on cognition and individual knowledge construction.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.05.011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609001209,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

Reconfirming Grice's (1975) well-known Cooperative Principle, an analysis of these data strongly suggest that an indirect request for driving directions is an effective communicative strategy for speakers approaching potential direction-givers. Furthermore, this analysis emphasizes the interrelatedness of the cognitive, linguistic and interactional tasks involved in direction-giving. A large body of important research has documented significant differences between the communicative styles of men and women. However, in this study, male and female participants’ use of directional indicators and their inclusion of landmarks, stoplight and time estimates, road names and highway numbers were very similar. Males included significantly more mileage estimates than did females, but their estimates contained more errors.

"Feryok, Anne",2010,Language teacher cognitions: Complex dynamic systems?,"Language teacher cognition research is a growing field. In recent years several features of language teacher cognitions have been noted: they can be complex, ranging over a number of different subjects; they can be dynamic, changing over time and under different influences; and they can be systems, forming unified and cohesive personal or practical theories. However, as yet there is no single theoretical framework for studying language teacher cognitions. In this article I propose that complex systems theory might offer such a framework. I offer an exploratory investigation of the applicability of complex systems theory by focusing on the re-analysis of a previously published case study of the practical theory of an English language teacher teaching EFL in Armenia. I do this by discussing and presenting evidence of heterogeneity, dynamics, non-linearity, openness, and adaptation, which characterize complex systems, and are displayed by the EFL teacher's cognitions. I conclude by suggesting that complex systems theory is compatible with other lines of research, is able to be developed in field-specific ways, offers several lines of research as well as different methodological approaches, and has practical implications for language teacher development.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.02.001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X1000028X,manual_search[system]
"Finch, Andrew",2010,Critical incidents and language learning: Sensitivity to initial conditions,"Critical incident theory has helped teachers to reflect on their teaching practice and elicit ways of improving it through identification of preconceptions and through reflection on the significance of unplanned incidents. This paper adapts these ideas to the perspective of language learners, in order to promote awareness and development of learning through conscious reflection. Recognizing that language learning is a complex, dynamic process, with numerous interacting and often unpredictable factors, the research incorporates aspects of complexity theory, according to which, apparently insignificant ‘initial’ events can determine the way in which global structures (e.g. learning) ‘emerge’ over the long term. Awareness of this concept can enable students and teachers to facilitate positive critical incidents and avoid harmful ones. In investigating the significance of ‘sensitivity to initial conditions’ in terms of language learning, this study invited graduate and undergraduate students to reflect on their learning over a semester and to identify critical incidents from their previous elementary and secondary schooling. Analysis of their responses led to the conclusion that sensitivity to initial events (critical incidents) does occur in language learning, but that the learner needs to ‘notice’ the incidents for triggering or realization to take place and to influence subsequent learning.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.05.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000813,manual_search[system]

In particular, this study examined the mitigation strategies and indirect speech acts used by the interactants. Mitigation has been defined as a modification of a speech act that softens the message for its hearer (Fraser, 1980:341). Several devices such as shields, hedges, parenthetical verbs and proverbial sayings were observed in this discursive context in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. This study also revealed that the use of mitigating devices on the part of the therapist was conditioned by his intentions to attain his goals: to indirectly motivate the client to continue with treatment. The qualitative analysis revealed how references to persons varied and how the Latino cultural notions of el qúe dirán and guardar las apariencias posited by Placencia (1996) emerged in this discursive context. Although mitigating features have been investigated in Spanish (Bravo, 2008, Haverkate, 1990, Hernández Flores, 1999, Murillo Medrano, 2002, Placencia, 1996, among others), overall they remain relatively under investigated in Spanish psychotherapeutic discourse.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.12.005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037821660900321X,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Geyer, Naomi",2010,Teasing and ambivalent face in Japanese multi-party discourse,"This paper examines teasing – an interactionally delicate social action, which appears to be both face threatening and face enhancing – situated in Japanese institutional multi-party discourse. Adopting conversation analytic and ethnographic approaches to discourse, this paper first reconsiders the notion of face and facework as discursively constructed phenomena. The paper then documents how the face of tease recipients is displayed and contested in discourse: the linguistic behavior of the teased immediately before the onset of a teasing sequence exhibits certain deviations, which trigger the subsequent tease. The paper takes a closer look at the emerging face of the teased from the perspective of their community of practice. It demonstrates how the tease recipients’ modes of participation are related to face threats occurring in teasing segments and how their active role in the joint act of teasing may impact the construction of their evolving identities within their community of practice. The findings suggest that teasing sequences represent instances in which a tacit norm of appropriateness becomes observable in discourse, that facework can be depicted as an argumentative process in which one's face ascription is contested and altered, and that the face threats involved in specific teasing segments are related to the tease recipients’ mode of participation in their community of practice.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.12.015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609003312,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Glenn, Phillip",2010,Interviewer laughs: Shared laughter and asymmetries in employment interviews,"Routinely, in a corpus of videotaped employment interviews, the interviewer invites laughter.

Rather, the interviewee will wait for the interviewer to take the lead in returning them to the business of the interview. The asymmetries evident in the sequential organization of these shared laughs show participant orientation to respective institutional roles. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous research examining doctor–patient and survey interviewer–respondent interactions. While laughing together might appear to reduce power distance and bring participants together, the organization and distribution of these shared laughter instances reflect and reinscribe the hegemony of the roles of interviewer and interviewee.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.01.009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610000226,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Goethals, Patrick",2010,A multi-layered approach to speech events: The case of Spanish justificational conjunctions,"I will describe the structural and semantic characteristics of the Spanish causal conjunctions como (as, since), ya que (as, since), and pues (for). I will argue that, unlike predicative causal conjunctions like porque (because), they function as speech event markers. This difference will be related to Peirce's semiotic distinction between symbolic and indexical signs. A speech event will be defined as a three-dimensional event, including a modal, interpersonal and sequential dimension. The three justificational conjunctions give the same indication at the sequential dimension: they identify the speech event as an act of justification. I will show that what further distinguishes the three conjunctions from each other can be analyzed in terms of the other two dimensions. I will argue that pues activates both the modal and the interpersonal dimension, that ya que activates the modal dimension but de-activates the interpersonal dimension, and that como de-activates both the modal and the interpersonal dimension. I will show that this analysis can explain certain typical pragmatic effects, for instance why pues marks the information that follows as new, why ya que allows special uses like irony or is frequently used to introduce quotations, and why como presents the information as taken for granted. In the concluding section, I will argue that the framework is not only suited to describe Spanish causal conjunctions, but has a broader theoretical and descriptive scope.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.01.018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610000317,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Grainger, Karen Mills, Sara Sibanda, Mandla",2010,“Just tell us what to do”: Southern African face and its relevance to intercultural communication,"This paper contributes to the debate on the precise nature of face as a universal phenomenon, and the cultural variability within it. Specifically, we bring the ‘Southern’ perspective to the debate by discussing the previously neglected African dimension. Recent scholarship suggests that the concept of face and the notion of self in traditional African culture may have more in common with Eastern collectivist cultures than with Anglo-American culture. We examine the interactional management of an encounter between a Zimbabwean English speaker and British English speakers in a community singing group. We argue that, while face needs may be universally relevant in such a situation, the way in which they are oriented to in interaction depends on cultural understandings of which aspects of face are paramount in particular circumstances. Since these assumptions are deep-seated and invisible they are not easily open to explicit negotiation and hence can lead to misinterpretation. By conducting an ethnographic study of the communicative event and combining it with a detailed examination of the co-construction of meaning in this interaction, we show how the participants’ contributions can be related to differing – and potentially conflicting – interpretation frameworks. These frameworks are informed by culture-specific notions of appropriate self-presentation.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.12.017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609003336,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

It further investigates whether the phrase appears to be used as an epistemic device or an affective device, and the variety of pragmatic or semantic functions it fulfils in the discourse. With regard to both the full and the truncated phrase, British speakers use the phrase with different frequency and for different reasons than New Zealand speakers. Both phrases are used most often as a hedge or marker of uncertainty, and used predominantly in conversations, followed by meetings and oral history interviews. In addition, the phrase often occurs alone and mostly in the initial sentence position. And while native speakers used the phrases more as politeness devices, learners used them most to express hesitation or uncertainty. Further research could add to these findings by looking at all the meanings the phrases have in conversation, their use in academic discourse, as well as use of the single variant, ‘Dunno’. Learners would benefit by having some of this included in language learning materials.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.01.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610000172,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Grieve, Averil",2010,"“Aber ganz ehrlich”: Differences in episodic structure, apologies and truth-orientation in German and Australian workplace telephone discourse","This paper reports on a study of cultural differences in conversational structure and the expression of apology in German and Australian workplace telephone discourse. While the overall episodic structure of German and Australian telephone conversations was similar, there were differences in content or social orientation. This impacted on both whether and how topics representing high threat to face were aired. Australians preferred to avoid face-threatening acts and, if an apology was required, minimise threat to face by telling half-truths. Germans were more likely to provide a truthful account of events, express disappointment and chastise their interlocutors. While such cultural styles were initially transferred from German into English, the longer German native-speakers interacted with Australian English-speaking colleagues, the more likely they were to hide negative opinions and tell half-truths. At the same time, Australians who interacted with Germans on a daily basis tended to accommodate towards German interactional style in English. This study indicates that further research should be conducted on Australian and German workplace discourse. Such research may further our understanding of stumbling blocks to successful inter-cultural workplace communication and provide insight for the teaching of socio-pragmatics in second language acquisition settings.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.05.009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609001192,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

In the teaching of speech styles, it has been pointed out that students' attention should be drawn to various social meanings that can be indexed by the linguistic form (Cook 2008, Pizziconi 2011). However, a question remains as to whether such awareness of indexical properties is even possible for students in the foreign language context, particularly because they have less exposure to the target language. This study examines the awareness of various indexical properties of speech styles among fourteen intermediate Japanese students in the foreign language classroom. Specifically, it analyzes the students' choice of speech styles in a task of translating an e-mail from English to Japanese before and after five study sessions that explored the various indexical properties of the Japanese language. This paper argues that awareness of various social meanings indexed by language is possible at the intermediate level, and such awareness makes students active and conscious users of the language, rather than as learners following prescriptive norms.]",,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/24892017,manual_search[japanese_language_and_literature]

"He, Jiani Suzuki, Yuichi",2024,Distribution of grammar learning through writing tasks: A potential role of proficiency,"Abstract The present study examines the optimal schedule of second language (L2) grammar practice. Fifty-four English-as-a-foreign language learners practiced using hypothetical conditionals through written production-based dictogloss tasks, accompanied by an explicit grammatical explanation, in three learning sessions over several weeks. Learners in the longer spaced group engaged in dictogloss tasks at intervals of 7 days (Day 1, 8, and 15), while those in the shorter spaced group did so at intervals of 3.5 days (Day 1, 4, and 8). Results showed that shorter spaced and longer spaced learning led to equally accurate use of the hypothetical conditionals on both 3-week and 6-week delayed posttests. The effects of practice condition on 6-week delayed posttest performance were moderated by L2 proficiency. Specifically, the retention rate after 6 weeks was greater for more proficient learners than for less proficient learners, but only in the shorter spaced group. Due to the exploratory nature of this study with small sample size, we call for more empirical research that explores the interaction between practice distribution and individual differences, including but not limited to L2 proficiency.",,10.1111/ijal.12498,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijal.12498,manual_search[international_journal_of_applied_linguistics]

This paper demonstrates how such profiles can be created using data collected from a study of 50 low level Japanese college students. To exemplify this approach five profiles are compared. The results of this study suggest that learners should not be analysed as homogenous groups.

"Ho, Victor",2010,Constructing identities through request e-mail discourse,"This paper describes how the leaders of a group of English language teachers in a Hong Kong public education institute constructed various personal identities for themselves through the discourse of the request e-mails they sent to their subordinates. The request e-mails were analyzed at both clause and discourse levels to reveal the strategies the leaders employed for constructing desirable personal identities and ultimately achieving request compliance. At the clause level, first, the lexico-grammar was analyzed by drawing upon systemic functional grammar; and second the leaders’ management of the relationship with their subordinates was analyzed with reference to the constructs of rapport management and relational work. At the discourse level, the way the authors supported their request was analyzed by drawing upon the influence tactics framework. It is argued in the paper that the e-mail authors’ legitimate or position power intrinsically associated with their capacity as leaders was not sufficient in obtaining request compliance – additional elements like desirable personal identities were necessary in getting their subordinates to comply with the requests made via e-mails. The identities constructed included those of (1) an accountable leader, (2) a rational leader, (3) an authoritative leader, (4) an understanding, considerate and polite leader, and (5) a capable leader.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.02.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610000378,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

Highly understood in metaphorical senses, hyperbolic expressions of emotion have rich data revealing that hyperbole draws on metaphor as a bedrock mechanism.

Some attempt to integrate insights from the broader field of second language (L2) writing research, teaching their students to use rhetorical and organizational devices and strategies in addition to the more traditional focus on grammatical and vocabulary. However, most university FL instructors appear to use writing only as means of introducing and/or reinforcing other aspects of language learning. Unfortunately, the reasons behind this disparity are not well understood. In an attempt to describe the extent to which L2 writing research is currently informing university FL instruction, a survey was administered to 153 FL instructors working at universities within the United States.

They play important cognitive and social functions in discourse. This paper examines how learners' use of such fillers developed among five male English-speaking learners of Japanese while studying abroad for one academic year in Japan. The quantitative and qualitative analyses of fillers in Oral Proficiency Interviews (OPI) conducted before and after study abroad reveal that while their use of fillers prior to studying in Japan seemed to be driven almost exclusively by cognitive needs (e.g., searching for words), upon return the learners' fillers more frequently served social/interpersonal purposes (e.g., mitigating comments of negative evaluation), demonstrating that language gains may be missed in studies that emphasize quantitative rather than qualitative analysis.]",,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/41151390,manual_search[japanese_language_and_literature]
"Iwasaki, Noriko",2011,"Learning L2 Japanese ""Politeness"" and ""Impoliteness"": Young American Men's Dilemmas during Study Abroad","[Interviews conducted in English with four male second language (L2) learners of Japanese who studied abroad for an academic year illuminated the dilemmas they experienced during their social interactions in Japan as young American men. Dilemmas arose from within themselves and from the expectations and perceptions that native (L1) Japanese speakers had of them. On the one hand, some of the L2 learners felt discomfort with the so-called ""polite"" desu/masu forms that they associated with social distance, which appeared to be incompatible with friendliness that is highly valued in politeness in American English. On the other hand, they felt that L1 Japanese speakers expected American men to act and speak informally and did not expect them to use desu/masu forms or other honorifics. Some LI speakers also addressed them in the informal plain style in situations where the use of the desu/masu form is the Lᖎ Japanese norm. At the same time, they were mostly deprived of the more manly ""impolite"" language commonly used among young Japanese men in informal settings. These learners' use of the desu/masu forms or apparent overuse of the informal plain forms upon return can be construed as each learner's own response to these dilemmas and their struggles in indexing their social identities through the speech styles.]",,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/41151381,manual_search[japanese_language_and_literature]

After administering an English Language Proficiency test (Fowler and Coe, 1976), 90 homogeneous pre-intermediate female college students were selected, and they were randomly assigned to three groups: two experimental and one control. The experimental groups (A and B) received instruction according to STAD and GI techniques respectively whereas the control group was instructed via the Conventional Instruction (CI) technique which followed an individualistic instructional approach based on the exercises in their regular textbook. A post-test was administered, and its results were analyzed through a one-way ANOVA and post hoc Scheffe statistics. The results revealed that STAD is a more effective technique in improving EFL reading comprehension achievement whereas GI and CI did not enhance reading comprehension significantly. Team rewards, as one of the central concepts of STAD, may have a strong impact on learners’ performance in reading comprehension.",,10.1016/j.system.2009.12.009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X0900147X,manual_search[system]

"Ji, Shaojun",2010,The iconicity assumption and the functional distribution of English temporal adverbial clauses: A textual perspective,"Based on an analysis of a large group of preposed English finite temporal adverbial clauses (TACs), the present study reveals that a considerable number of them do not serve as a thematic link between preceding discourse and their main clause, which suggests that the characterization of their discourse function on the basis of this link is inadequate. Focusing on their shared role in maintaining the temporal line in narrative discourse, the study proposes to view their use as motivated by an effort to collaborate with the general strategy preferred by language users for comprehending temporal information as suggested by the iconicity assumption. From this point of view, the motivation for using TACs in a preposed position is to override the reader's iconicity assumption by specifying the temporal relationship between the main clause and preceding discourse. Serving this function makes preposed TACs part of the chain of temporal adverbials forming the temporal line of a narrative. In accordance with this understanding of preposed TACs, their postposed counterparts are seen as playing a complementary role—they are used in a postposed position when their temporal information is needed without interfering with the temporal line of a narrative.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.07.009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610002146,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

In the study these functions are examined, focusing on five loci in which code-switching is frequent, namely quotations, interjections, reiterations, ‘gaps’ and word/language play. The data of the study consists of three published plays by a Chicana playwright. The study concludes that code-switching fills creative, artistic and stylistic functions in the plays and that it can be used to add emphasis to a certain word or passage, to add another level of meaning, to deepen/intensify a meaning, to clarify, to evoke richer images and to instruct the audience about a particular concept. Code-switching is also used to mark closeness, familiarity, to emphasize bonds, and to include or, on the contrary, to mark distance, break bonds and exclude. Complex identities of the characters as well as the plots of the plays are constructed and developed by means of language. Code-switching is thus used to enhance and support the representation of the characters.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.08.012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002355,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Kang, Okim",2010,Relative salience of suprasegmental features on judgments of L2 comprehensibility and accentedness,"Suprasegmentals have been emphasized in ESL/EFL pedagogy since the advent of communicative language teaching. However, it is still unclear how individual suprasegmental features affect listeners' judgments of non-native speakers' accented speech. The current study began to specify relative weights of individual temporal and prosodic features for listeners' judgments on L2 comprehensibility and accentedness. Using the PRAAT computer program, 5 min of continuous in-class lectures from 11 international teaching assistants (ITAs) were acoustically analyzed for measures of speech rate, pauses, stress, and pitch range. Fifty eight US undergraduate students evaluated the ITAs' oral performance and commented on their ratings. The results revealed that suprasegmental features independently contributed to listeners' perceptual judgments. Accent ratings were best predicted by pitch range and word stress measures whereas comprehensibility scores were mostly associated with speaking rates. ITAs' acoustic profiles as well as listeners' comments on their rating offer practical implications to ITA program developers, ESL teachers, and future research in accented speech.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.01.005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X1000031X,manual_search[system]

In pragmatic interpretation the cognitive- philosophical line of research appears to put more emphasis on the proposition expressed (e.g. Horn, 2005, Levinson, 2000) while the socio-cultural interactional line (e.g. Verschueren, 1999, Mey, 2001) underscores the importance of allowing socio-cultural context into linguistic analysis. Following the socio-cultural interactional line Mey claimed that the explanatory movement in a theory of pragmatic acts is from the outside in: “the focus is on the environment in which both speaker and hearer find their affordances, such that the entire situation is brought to bear on what can be said in the situation, as well as on what is actually being said (Mey, 2001:221).” In the paper I will argue that from the perspective of SBUs the explanatory movement should go in both directions: from the outside in and from the inside out.

Contributing to recent studies that have proposed –ta's functions in discourse, this study examines –ta's different boundary tones and argues that they allow speakers to perform different social actions in naturally occurring conversation. Based upon conversation analysis of video- and audio-recorded conversations, this article demonstrates that speakers, by using –ta in a high boundary tone, display the conveyed information as announceable and newsworthy, thereby highlighting newness of the information. Due to these characteristics, -ta utterances are overwhelmingly found in pre-telling sequences in which speakers announce news and within telling sequences in which speakers provide information that they believe is tellable for the development of a telling. By taking into account a boundary tone mapped onto a specific sentence-ender and analyzing in detail naturally occurring interaction with access to non-verbal interaction, the study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of prosody and interaction.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.022,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610001207,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Kimmel, Michael",2010,"Why we mix metaphors (and mix them well): Discourse coherence, conceptual metaphor, and beyond","The paper explores the phenomenon of metaphors that occur in close textual adjacency, i.e. as metaphor clusters, but do not share a similar cognitive basis. Clusters frequently mix ontologies and are thus devoid of coherence that can be explained as emerging from a single conceptual metaphor. Evidence to that effect comes from a British corpus (Sun and Guardian) of 675 newspaper commentaries covering the 2004/05 EU referenda (in all, 2574 metaphors). First, it turns out that journalists combine metaphors into complex, yet well-formed arguments on a regular basis, with 39% and 62% of all metaphors respectively occurring in clusters. Even more strikingly, the data reveals that ontologically mixed metaphors account for 76% of all clusters and that almost all of these are straightforwardly comprehensible. This challenges the view of mixed metaphor as awkward language usage. I argue that mixing works because metaphors are typically embedded in separate clauses situated at different temporal, causal, speaker, or belief-related conceptual planes. By consequence, no strong joint processing pressure arises that could result in a perceived clash of metaphorical imagery. Thus, felicitous mixing is a natural by-product of the shifting logic of clauses in complex argumentation. In addition, I present a qualitative typology of how clustering metaphors interact in argumentation. It calls into question the view that conceptual metaphors are the coherence-maintaining device par excellence. While conceptual metaphors may create “internal binding” in ontologically coherent clusters, complementary “external binding” models are needed to explain the mixed clusters (and ultimately for a full explanation of all kinds of metaphor-based argumentation).",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.05.017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609001222,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Kizu, Mika Pizziconi, Barbara Iwasaki, Noriko",2013,Modal Markers in Japanese: A Study of Learners' Use before and after Study Abroad,"[Japanese discourse requires speakers to index, in a relatively explicit manner, their stance toward the propositional information as well as the hearer. This is done, among other things, by means of a grammaticalized set of modal markers. Although previous research suggests that the use of modal expressions by second language learners differs from that of native users, little is known about ""typical"" native or non-native behavior. This study aims (a) to delineate native and non-native usage by a quantitative examination of a broad range of Japanese modal categories, and qualitative analyses of a subset of potentially problematic categories among them, and (b) to identify possible developmental trajectories, by means of a longitudinal observation of learners' verbal production before and after study abroad in Japan. We find that modal categories realized by non-transparent or non-salient markers (e.g., explanatory modality no da, or utterance modality sentence-final particles) pose particular challenges in spite of their relatively high availability in the input, and we discuss this finding in terms of processing constraints that arguably affect learners' acquisition of the grammaticalized modal markers.]",,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/24394362,manual_search[japanese_language_and_literature]

Past research has suggested that indirect meaning poses comprehension challenges for learners of a second language (L2). This result has been explained with reference to the influence of proficiency and the linguistic/discourse-level conventionality of indirect meaning types. To verify and potentially extend these results, we conducted a close replication of a 2016 study of indirect meaning comprehension in L2 Spanish by Taguchi and colleagues, for which we used a group of L2 French learners. Results confirmed most of the study's findings. In our interpretation, we suggest that our results are consistent with the idea that difficulties with indirect meaning comprehension largely stem from lacunae in general oral comprehension, thus calling into question the idea that indirect meaning may be globally more difficult to interpret.",,10.1111/flan.12719,https://doi.org/10.1111/flan.12719,manual_search[foreign_language_annals]

Several studies have shown the construct of motivation and relationships between motivational components and language achievement. However, it is still unclear whether or not these individual-difference variables can be developed or undermined in a classroom context. In this study, the dynamicity of individual-difference variables during 15-week university English courses in Japan was investigated. A total of seven variables were examined: test and English classroom anxiety, persistence, motivation to learn English, integrative orientation, instrumental orientation, communication apprehension, and cooperativeness. The results indicated that learners' anxiety and their sense of cooperativeness changed significantly, but other variables showed a stabilizing tendency from a global perspective. However, an individual analysis revealed that learners with high motivation showed the upholding of motivational components, whereas learners with low motivation showed the positive development of them. Finally, the decrease in communication apprehension that was assumed to be caused by the increase in cooperativeness led to the disappearance of negative relationships between communication apprehension and motivational variables.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.03.001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000217,manual_search[system]
"Komlósi, László I. Tarrósy, István",2010,Presumptive arguments turned into a fallacy of presumptuousness: Pre-election debates in a democracy of promises,"This paper deals with pre-election discourse in Hungary identifying complex argumentative moves that call for modifications in traditional research methodologies. Based on theoretical studies and real-life public debates a fine-grained analysis is offered to discern substantive arguments from presumptive arguments. The assessment of politicians’ argumentative practices takes into account both the critical-rationalist and the pragma-dialectical perspectives on reasoned discussion. The results show that presumptions function as special kinds of inferences grounded in considerations related to the context or circumstances in which the inferences are to be drawn. Presumptive reasoning is shown to be a paradigm case of rational activity in assessing the expectations of others. In the analysis of political discourse the aim is to find out what beliefs electors entertain and how their positions on certain issues get influenced by politicians’ arguments. Thus, the paper offers a new look at the notion of rational discussion. The early bed-rock certainty of the pragma-dialectical approach to argumentation as a prime example of normative pragmatics seems to be losing its primacy: at best we can try to adhere to a mixture of a critical-rationalistic view of reasonableness and the dialectical notion of reasonableness in real-life debates and public argumentations.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.08.018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002100,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

However, understanding the epistemic stance for the speaker's world is challenging. Second, this paper supports the integration of usage-based approaches and sociocultural theory.

A total of 188 university students participated in this study. Before and after instruction, they completed a motivation questionnaire to measure their pragmatic motivation, and a perception questionnaire to assess their perceptions of email politeness in student-faculty communication. They were also asked to comment on the tested emails and justify their evaluations by referring to specific linguistic features from the email messages. The 12-hour strategy instruction, conducted over one month, introduced learners to various cognitive and metacognitive pragmatics learning strategies. Results revealed that strategy instruction significantly enhanced both learners? pragmatic awareness and pragmatic motivation. Qualitative results further indicated that the instruction enabled learners to draw on a broader range of sociopragmatic factors to scaffold their pragmatic evaluations. However, no correlation was found between the increases in pragmatic awareness and pragmatic motivation, suggesting that motivation did not directly contribute to the development of pragmatic awareness.",,10.1111/ijal.12733,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijal.12733,manual_search[international_journal_of_applied_linguistics]

"Li, Eden Sum-hung",2010,Making suggestions: A contrastive study of young Hong Kong and Australian students,"This study contrasts the syntactic forms and pragmatic strategies adopted by Cantonese students in making suggestions in English (their L2) not only with Australian students, who serve as a target-based control group, but also with other Cantonese students in Cantonese (their L1), who serve to foreground the result of the above-mentioned comparison. In terms of syntactic forms, the study finds that in comparison with Australian students, Cantonese students in their L2 adopt fewer syntactic types in making suggestions. In addition, their suggestions are less likely to be embedded in elliptical or complex sentences but more likely to be preceded by textual themes and interpersonal metaphors. In terms of pragmatic strategies, Cantonese students resemble Australian students in their choices of perspective, directness and politeness in general.

"Li, Juan",2010,Transitivity and lexical cohesion: Press representations of a political disaster and its actors,"Using The New York Times’ and China Daily's reports of the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia in May 1999 as examples, this article aims to unravel the processes of representing the event and its social actors in news texts. The article focuses on investigating the relations between choices of certain linguistic forms and the ideologies and power relations which underlie such forms. Guided by assumptions of critical discourse analysis and drawing on the analytical framework offered in Michael Halliday's Systemic Functional Grammar, the article examines two dimensions of clause grammar: transitivity and lexical cohesion, which may be respectively associated with the ideational and textual functions of language. By analyzing aspects of clause grammar related to these two dimensions of language in news texts of different ideological orientations, the article shows that interpretations of the NATO bombing and of the roles of social actors involved in the bombing event are constructed in the specific choices that each newspaper makes in the two dimensions of text organization.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.028,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610001268,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

To counteract these limitations, this study used a pre-test/post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design to compare the effects of peer-editing to that of self-editing on students’ correction of specific language errors in revised drafts. The language errors under study are two rule-based errors (subject/verb agreement, pronoun agreement) and two non rule-based errors (wrong word choice, awkward sentence structure). Results revealed that compared to the comparison group, the experimental group significantly reduced their rule-based errors in revised drafts but not the non rule-based errors. Since both groups received teacher instruction in editing language errors, but only the experimental group engaged in peer-editing, these results may be attributed to peer-editing. The study contributes to teaching pedagogy by encouraging teachers to use peer-editing in the writing classroom and to focus on the correction of few language errors to bring about language development.",,10.1016/j.system.2009.12.008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X09001468,manual_search[system]

The main focus is on how often and in what contexts learners shift, whether these shifts are consistent with indexical uses of the da style and what might be affecting students' use of the da style. The data show that shifts for negotiation moves and subordinate clauses were most frequent and functioned as discourse organizers, indexing subordinate or tangential information. Although few in number, shifts for adjectives that indexed private expression were the most natural and target-like. Further, shifts for adjectives with the particle ne and random/anomalous instances of da-style shifts suggested that learners might have been attempting to extend their da style to include the use of sentence final particles (SFPs) or to different contexts. The findings further suggest that there is a progression of da-style use and that learners' beliefs, the quality and type of their interactions with their host families, and the use of SFPs affect learners' use and acquisition of the da style.]",,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/24394371,manual_search[japanese_language_and_literature]

"Meddeb, Elizabeth J. Frenz-Belkin, Patricia",2010,What? I Didn’t Say THAT!: Linguistic strategies when speaking to write,"This study attempts to identify strategies peculiar to speakers of non-standard varieties of American English when composing with speech recognition-based dictation software. Two speakers of African American Vernacular English and one non-native speaker of English were asked to orally compose a series of college-level writing tasks using ViaVoice 98. The findings indicate that when the software misrecognized their speech, the language minority students resorted to similar strategies as those of standard American speakers discussed in the literature such as speaker adaptation to recognition systems leading to hyperarticulation and other types of phonetic and lexical adjustments. Moreover, the participants based their strategies on their knowledge of human-to-human interaction (e.g., the sequential organization of talk), which more often than not proved to be useless when interacting with the software. Yet, the students did seem to build up an awareness during the speech sessions of their linguistic variety and its divergence from the standard American accent that the software was originally modeled after.

"Mehrpour, Saeed Rahimi, Mohammad",2010,The impact of general and specific vocabulary knowledge on reading and listening comprehension: A case of Iranian EFL learners,"The present study was carried out to determine the effect of general vocabulary knowledge and gaining familiarity with the specific vocabulary content of a reading or listening comprehension test on a group of Iranian EFL learners’ reading and listening comprehension ability. Two groups of male and female English majors (N = 58) participated in the study. In one group (the treatment group), the participants were given a reading comprehension test accompanied by a glossary which contained the meaning of the most difficult words appearing in the reading comprehension test. In the other group (the control group), the students received the same test without the glossary. The same procedure was followed for a listening comprehension test in the two groups in another session. The analysis of the data revealed that the students in the treatment group significantly outperformed those in the control group in both reading and listening comprehension tests. Further analysis of the data indicated that the learners’ knowledge of the general vocabulary content of the reading and listening comprehension texts only affected their performance on the reading comprehension test. The results of the present study shed more light on the influence of knowledge of vocabulary on reading and listening comprehension.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.01.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000308,manual_search[system]

"Miyazoe, Terumi Anderson, Terry",2010,"Learning outcomes and students' perceptions of online writing: Simultaneous implementation of a forum, blog, and wiki in an EFL blended learning setting","This paper examines the effectiveness of three different online writing activities in formal university education: forums, blogs, and wikis. Constructivism – reflective and collaborative learning fostered by scaffolding – provides a main support for their use in education. Prior research regarding the use of blogs and wikis, especially in language education, is reviewed. The lack of detailed examination to determine learning outcomes, the absence of an evaluation mechanism, and the special difficulty language education holds for their appreciation are noted. The latter half of the paper presents exploratory research executed by the authors on the usage of forums, blogs, and wikis in an English as foreign language (EFL)-blended learning course in a university in Tokyo, Japan. A mixed-method approach was applied with survey, interview, and text analysis used for triangulation. The survey revealed students' positive perceptions of the blended course design with online writings – wikis being the most favorable, followed by blogs and forums. Qualitative text analysis of forum and wiki writings showed progress in their ability to differentiate English writing styles. The interview script analysis clarified the different merits students perceived from each activity. The variations provided by the blended course design served well in meeting challenges and were fun for them.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.03.006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000266,manual_search[system]

We can teach students how to use learning strategies efficiently, helping them gain autonomy and control of their own learning process. This study applied strategy instruction to pragmatics learning in a second language (L2). Adapting Oxford's (2011) taxonomy, we taught L2 learners various cognitive and metacognitive strategies, including how to pay attention to select pragmatic features, and how to monitor and evaluate their learning of the features. Four L2 Chinese learners and six L2 Japanese learners in a US university received strategy instruction on targeted pragmatic features (i.e., conversation opening/closing; indirect meaning). The instruction was followed by a two-week period in which students kept a daily journal recording their experiences with the targeted features. Interviews were conducted at the end to gauge students' reflections of the strategy applications. Results showed that students noticed targeted pragmatic features in available resources, but there was imbalance in the degree of noticing and types of strategies used.",Article,10.1558/eap.38207,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=3e6d91bf-bd22-321a-b165-3521e924f2c5,manual_search[east_asian_pragmatics]

"Nishida, Rieko Yashima, Tomoko",2010,Classroom interactions of teachers and elementary school Pupils as observed during a musical project in a Japanese elementary school,"This study focuses on the nature of classroom interactions in an EFL classroom context among young learners from a socio-cultural theoretical perspective. During the year 2007, a musical project was carried out at a public elementary school in Osaka, Japan; all the fifth graders, 126 students, aged 10–11, participated in the musical project. Of these, thirty-two students of class A (15 boys and 17 girls) participated in the present study for classroom video recordings. Seven classroom lessons lasting 45 min each were conducted between September 2007 and January 2008. The data from three protocols were transcribed into a written format from the original video recordings and a teacher’s observation notes were also obtained. The researchers investigated how the teachers scaffold the students’ use of language, how their scaffolding pattern changes over time, and how students’ interaction patterns in the classroom change over time. In addition to teacher–student scaffolding patterns, student–student scaffolding was observed in a later classroom session. The findings indicate that teachers’ scaffolding patterns changed over time as shown in the three protocols. During the transition from Protocol 1, Protocol 2, Protocol 3, teacher–student scaffolding was gradually reduced as students had learned to produce their own dialogs. Further, peer-scaffolding was observed for the first time in Protocol 3. Although this musical project was quite challenging for the learners, the study shows that if sufficient scaffolding is provided, learners are clearly able to improve their current language level.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.03.017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000771,manual_search[system]

In addition to assuming their co-operation in contexts of language use, we also accept that detached from their contexts, some pieces of contextual information can become context-independent. Furthermore, such kind of encyclopedic information and information concerning the use of language can be considered an integral part of lexical-semantic representations as well. The analysis of three types of Hungarian utterances, namely utterances containing implicit arguments, implicit predicates and co-composition, in the framework we propose demonstrates that grammatical factors (including lexical-semantic representations and morphosyntactic properties) and pragmatic factors (general and context-dependent pragmatic knowledge) thoroughly and intensively interact in various ways. On the basis of the analysis it can also be concluded that, in the absence of pragmatic information, use or interpretation predicted by grammar can often be evaluated as only typical or even underspecified, and, if the context is more specific, it can determine the utterance meaning to a greater degree.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.07.001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609001787,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

The data for the analysis were obtained from 71 role-play activities conducted during an OPI. The analysis is based on conversation analytic (CA) methodology and invokes the analytic frameworks of interactive footing and interactional competencies. Conversational analyses performed on the data revealed that candidates executed not only the role-play instructions but also the interviewers’ explicit and implicit requirements of the next desirable action. In doing so, candidates employed and displayed their interactional competencies in role-play interactions. The role-play activity in the OPI being managed by the interviewer created an asymmetrical relationship between the interviewers and the candidates in terms of speaking rights (i.e., turn-taking and topical organization). Nevertheless, competencies that candidates displayed in performing a role-play activity did not seem different from those employed in ordinary conversations. Thus, role-play activity in OPIs, if recognized as an interactional phenomenon co-constructed by participants’ display of their turn-by-turn practical evaluation of each other's actions, seems to be a valid instrument for assessing the candidates’ performance of the given tasks.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.11.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002823,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

The second argument is that the maxim of politeness is part of rational conversation among potentially aggressive parties. This leads to a new Gricean theory of politeness: the maxim of politeness is seen as an additional conversational maxim under the Cooperative Principle in rational conversations among potentially aggressive parties.

"Philips, Susan U.",2010,Semantic and interactional indirectness in Tongan lexical honorification,"This paper compares semantic indirectness and interactional indirectness in Tongan lexical honorification and relates them to each other, demonstrating a need for greater methodological and theoretical attention to interactional indirectness, both in the study of honorific systems and more generally in the linguistic conceptualization of indirectness. Semantically the Tongan honorific vocabulary is created primarily through metaphorical extensions and semantic bleaching of everyday words. These processes are common in linguistic honorific systems. While the metaphorical extensions predominate in Tongan language ideology, the semantically bleached words predominate in the actual use of the honorific vocabulary. There are conventions of entextualization of the Tongan honorific speech register that give it common linguistic features across a range of Tongan public social activities, and a common approach to the social personae who are the targets of honorification. These conventions render the semantically bleached words more semantically specific in use. In addition, in the lived reality of ongoing interaction, speakers collaborate in producing shared denotationally specific meanings of honorifics, while maintaining the surface vagueness of the semantically bleached honorific terms.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.06.005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609001507,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Pino-Silva, Juan Mayora, Carlos A.",2010,English teachers' moderating and participating in OCPs,"Online Communities of Practice (OCPs) are among the most accessible tools for EFL/ESL teachers' co-construction of knowledge and self-directed learning. Despite the welcomed proliferation of EFL/ESL teachers' OCPs, concomitant research on collaboration is noticeably lagging behind. The present paper is just a preliminary look at moderation and participation, two of the most salient roles of members in OCPs. The authors co-moderate a local Yahoo group of EFL teachers from Venezuela, and participate in an international Yahoo Group of EFL teachers from different countries and nationalities. By analyzing (a) the posts the authors wrote in each OCP and (b) the authors' introspective accounts completed for the purpose of this research, it appears that contrary to expectations there is not much difference in executing the roles of moderation and participation. Results indicate that, rather than changing their online behavior and style while embarking in the two tasks, each author appears to display similar behavioral tracts in both OCPs. Because English is the language of collaboration in both OCPs, results suggest that participation and moderation in OCPs may serve as a deterrent of language loss.

"Polat, Nihat",2010,A comparative analysis of pre-and in-service teacher beliefs about readiness and self-competency: Revisiting teacher education for ELLs,"This study addresses differences between pre-and in-service teacher beliefs about readiness and self-competency in helping English language learners' (ELL) language and academic achievement in content area classes. It also examines the role of gender and certain background factors in mediating differences in beliefs while providing suggestions to help pre-service teachers become ready for ELLs in mainstream classes. Three beliefs questionnaires were administered to 83 in-service and 88 pre-service teachers (n=171). The multivariate analyses suggested several significant differences between pre-and in-service teachers' beliefs about self-competency and readiness as well as specific recommendations to improve teacher education to better serve ELLs in mainstream classes. Yet, findings also revealed that gender and some background factors appeared to play a role in mediating some of these differences in beliefs. By bringing together the perspectives of both the teachers in training and those in the classroom, this study suggests that content area teachers feel unprepared and unready for mainstream classes with ELLs where they spend most of their school day. Consistent with current approaches to teacher education that aim to empower teachers, these findings, likewise, urge for a teacher-beliefs-driven approach to content area teacher education to ensure equal and inclusive opportunities for all students.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.03.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000242,manual_search[system]

The Toulmin elements in the students’ papers were analyzed and the quality of papers was assessed. It was found that an average paper had at least one claim supported by four pieces of data. However, there were far fewer uses of counterargument claim, counterargument data, rebuttal claim, and rebuttal data in the papers, although their uses were significant predictors of the overall quality of argumentative papers.

"Quinto-Pozos, David Mehta, Sarika",2010,Register variation in mimetic gestural complements to signed language,"Communication commonly occurs with both linguistic and gestural signals. In spoken languages the gestural signal can be manual (e.g., meaningful hand gestures) or vocal (e.g., meaningful uses of pauses, volume, and intonation), but in signed languages non-linguistic gesture and language occupy the same visual–gestural channel. One type of gesture, constructed action, is characteristically mimetic and allows for depiction of a character's actions with the speaker's body. We examine that type of gesture as it complements narratives presented in American Sign Language (ASL) to various audiences. A single text (an account of a Deaf leader's life) was recounted by two native Deaf signers of ASL to three different audiences, a design that allows us to apply the sociolinguistic framework of style known as audience design (Bell, 1984). The data show that constructed action can occur in both non-formal and formal settings. Additionally, if constructed action is analyzed by body parts (i.e., head, torso, arms/hands, and legs/feet) and degree of production (i.e., slight, moderate, exaggerated), some trends appear across settings. We suggest these trends could be attributed to the signers accommodating to their audiences. Finally, we report an association between degree of emphasis of constructed action and audience/setting for the two signers.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.08.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002033,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

Although studies have begun to examine humour within the medical workplace, none have employed observational methods to study laughables/laughter within the learning triad of the bedside teaching encounter (BTE). This paper focuses on this gap by exploring the novel question: How do students, patients, and doctors construct and co-construct power, identity and gender through laughter within BTEs? In this paper, we focus on the disaffiliative function of laughables/laughter across BTEs. Most of the laughables presented can be construed as teases: fallibility, frustration, cynicism and/or sexual teasing; and this teasing was accompanied by a competitive rather than collaborative play frame. Teasing and laughter was employed by participants to maintain or subvert existing power asymmetries, to construct identities, for example, as individuals who are intelligent, witty and powerful, and to construct gender by performing masculinity or femininity. Further research with a larger and more diverse sample of participants (including more female doctors, male students and female patients) is now essential to explore more fully the co-construction of power, identities and gender through laughter within medical workplace learning encounters.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.05.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610001542,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

For the creation of terminological knowledge bases (TKBs), this notion is too simplistic. Contexts must be studied from an integrated approach, such as Frame Semantics and Frame-Based Terminology. These theoretical and methodological frameworks do not separate the semantic and pragmatic components of language. Meaning is acquired in context, more specifically, within a frame including a semantic and pragmatic background. Within the domain of the environment, we select and manipulate multimodal information to offer two kinds of contexts to the end-user: (1) FrameNet-like contexts, more specifically, sentences showing the different syntactic constructions of the frame elements and the target predicate; (2) combined contexts, including knowledge-rich linguistic contexts coupled with knowledge-rich visual contexts, which provide a comprehensive view of related processes and specialized lexical units. In the TKB EcoLexicon, the resulting multimodal contexts are structured in terms of specific frames and general events.

To this purpose, we have carried out a comparative study of the conceptual metaphors of the Global Systemic Crisis in both English and Spanish. The financial crisis has indeed caused havoc in the economic panorama worldwide. Spain has been no exception, but, unlike other European countries, financial problems were initially belittled by the Spanish mass media for several months, until the subsequent outbreak of the crisis in relatively recent times. Following the current trend of corpus approaches to metaphor analysis (Charteris-Black, 2004, Deignan, 2006, Stefanowitsch and Gries, 2006), our study is based on a corpus of English and Spanish financial articles selected from those published during 2007 and the end of 2008 in the English journal The Economist and the Spanish newspaper El Economista. The analysis of the metaphors used in these articles will allow us to show how the same economic reality may be differently conceptualized at different points in time on account of different socio-political factors, such as a Government which, on the verge of national elections, refused to reveal the grim state of affairs of the national economy.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.06.001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610001736,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

Both groups of learners acquired the progressive ?ko iss? earlier than the resultative ?a iss?/?ko iss?, while L1 Japanese learners acquired the resultative use of ?ko iss? earlier than L1 English learners. Japanese learners? early acquisition of the resultative ?ko iss? is likely due to L1 transfer, because Japanese has a similar imperfective marker (?te i?).

"Saito, Junko",2010,Subordinates’ use of Japanese plain forms: An examination of superior–subordinate interactions in the workplace,"Early research on Japanese honorific and plain forms (i.e., non-honorific forms) claims that the use of honorific forms is socio-pragmatically governed, so that the speaker of lower status is obligated to employ these forms when interacting with an addressee of higher status. On the other hand, more recent studies on this topic empirically demonstrate that lower-status speakers employ a mixed use of honorific and plain forms even in inter-status interactions. Building on this recent work, this study examines subordinates’ use of plain forms in superior–subordinate interactions in a Japanese workplace, focusing on indexical meanings of these forms. The data in this study demonstrate that subordinates adopt plain forms in diverse situated contexts, such as self-addressing utterances, providing opinions, and clarifying superiors’ directives. Confirming that individuals adopt plain forms in a strategic manner even in a context where a hierarchical differential clearly exists, this study concludes that in superior–subordinate interactions in workplace discourse, subordinates’ use of the plain form indexes (1) the speaker's inward thought, and (2) the speaker's highlighting of information. The findings of this study further support the more recent research on indexical meanings of the plain form in Japanese.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.06.014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610001864,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

The referential value of pronouns is assessed on a discursive and dialogical basis by studying the givenness and newness of referents in the children's utterances and the links with the interlocutor's discourse. The results show that, from the onset, pronouns mostly refer to objects that are already in the interlocutors’ focus of attention and that have been previously mentioned in the dialogue. Moreover, pronouns most often refer to a discourse object previously mentioned by the child's interlocutor. This suggests that the anaphoric value of pronouns is first acquired through dialogue before it is extended to monological uses.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.09.020,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002513,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

The purpose was to identify whether there was evidence that such an intervention brought about changes in the students’ perception and practice in relation to their autonomous learning. The research engaged two groups of Thai university students who enrolled on an English Foundation course. In the Thai educational context, cultural influences and normal educational practices are obstacles to the promotion of autonomous learning. The prevailing characteristics attributed to Thai learners are that they are obedient, uncritical and unwilling to challenge the authority of teachers. To promote autonomous learning in Thailand is, therefore, a challenge. The research makes use of both qualitative and quantitative methods. The data from questionnaires and student learning journals suggest that the course management system plays a prominent role in the creation and development of four aspects of learner autonomy. These are autonomous perception, autonomous behaviour, autonomous strategy and interdependence.",,10.1016/j.system.2009.12.010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X09001481,manual_search[system]

The findings of this paper support the theory, which has been developed in several fields but including especially cognitive psychology, that the use of mental state language in general, and the verb want in particular, plays an important role in making transparent the kinds of thought processes central to a number of socially valued competencies, including imitative, instructional and collaborative learning and the exercise of social, and thus also moral responsibility.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.10.005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002628,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Seo, Mi-Suk Koshik, Irene",2010,A conversation analytic study of gestures that engender repair in ESL conversational tutoring,"This paper reports on results of a conversation analytic study of gestures used to initiate repair in ESL conversational tutoring sessions. These gestures function in similar ways to verbal “open class” (Drew, 1997) repair initiators such as “huh?” They are unaccompanied by verbal initiations, i.e., the nonverbal behavior alone is understood to be initiating repair. One gesture consists of a sharp head turn or head tilt to the side, with continued eyegaze on the recipient, sometimes accompanied by a widening of the eyes. The other is a head poke forward, accompanied with a movement of the upper body forward toward the recipient. The gestures are used by both the native speaker (NS) tutor and the non-native speaker (NNS) tutee, and they are most often understood by the recipients to involve problems in understanding the prior talk. At least one of the gestures can also be used in a pedagogically specific way to prompt self-correction. The gestures are initiated in the turn transition space after the trouble source, and they are held through the following turn(s) of talk until the problem is resolved. This paper adds to our understanding of both conversational repair and the use of gesture in native/non-native talk.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.01.021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610000342,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Shibata, Miki",2010,How Japanese teachers of English perceive non-native assistant English teachers,"Considering the issue of World Englishes, the present study attempts to investigate whether Japanese teachers of English (JTEs) prefer assistant English teachers (AETs) with native-like pronunciation yet minor inappropriate grammar use or those with native-level grammar yet English recognizably accented by their native language, and to what extent JTEs give priority to native-like pronunciation in their teaching. Using a questionnaire, data were collected from 24 junior high and 51 high school JTEs. The major finding was that junior high JTEs appeared to approve of both types of AET, whereas their senior high counterparts tended to be reluctant to accept non-native speakers as AETs. The difference observed in the two subject groups may reflect their different pedagogical goals. Finally, the issue of non-native AETs relates to the dual roles of the English language: the pedagogical role as a school subject to be taught and the socio-cultural role in the international community. In order to support the dual perspectives of English, language policy makers are urged to propose roles and qualifications for AETs that will accommodate and cultivate a positive attitude toward World Englishes.",,10.1016/j.system.2009.12.011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X09001493,manual_search[system]

"Spinelli, Franciele",2024,Examining learning opportunities and perceptions of Latin American ESL learners in varying proficiency-level groups,"Abstract Learner-to-learner (peer) interaction has been integral to the second language (L2) classroom since the advent of communicative-oriented pedagogies. Despite the well-documented benefits of peer interaction, the extent to which learners benefit may be impacted by a range of factors, particularly their peers? proficiency levels. Yet studies on the influence of peers? proficiency have shown contradictory findings and are extensively focused on pairs rather than small groups. Furthermore, although low-proficiency (LP) learners experience greater impacts from interaction with peers of different proficiency levels, their interactional patterns and perspectives are underexplored. This study investigates how six Latin American learners of English (core learners) co-created learning opportunities as they interacted with non-core learners (n = 33) in three proficiency small-group interactions. A total of 18 group interactions were analysed for language-related episodes (LREs) and turn-takings. The results showed that core learners? (CLs) LREs and turns diminished as their peers? proficiency increased. However, fewer incorrect LRE resolutions were found when CLs were grouped with high-proficiency (HP) peers. The CLs also perceived the interaction with HP peers as challenging but important for their L2 development. Additionally, aside from the proficiency level, CLs acknowledged the importance of their peers? positive attitudes for the success of their interactions. These findings provide important insights into employing mixed-proficiency groups to create more optimal learning conditions, particularly for LP learners.",,10.1111/ijal.12538,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijal.12538,manual_search[international_journal_of_applied_linguistics]

Sixty participants studied the simple and complex morphological rules of a novel miniature language system so as to use them for oral production. They engaged in four training sessions in either shorter spaced (3.3-day interval) or longer spaced (7-day interval) learning conditions. From the beginning of the third training session, the 3.3-day interval group started to provide more accurate target rules than the 7-day interval group. This superior performance by the 3.3-day interval group was maintained on both 7- and 28-day delayed posttests with small to medium effect sizes. No significant difference was found between the two groups for utterance speed, nor did linguistic complexity exert an influence on the effectiveness of different distributions of learning conditions.

"Szczepek Reed, Beatrice",2010,Speech rhythm across turn transitions in cross-cultural talk-in-interaction,"Research in conversation analysis has shown that speech rhythm is a relevant parameter for turn-taking amongst native speakers of British English. Not only is individual participants’ speech rhythmically structured, but rhythmic patterns also continue across speaker transitions. Participants employ such rhythmic integration as an interactional resource. By rhythmically integrating next turns into prior turns they display conversational alignment with previous speakers, whereas non-integration is treated as noticeable and non-default. British English has a tendency towards stress-timing, that is, stressed syllables occur at roughly regular intervals in time, with great variation in syllable duration. This paper investigates whether cross-transitional speech rhythm also occurs when speakers of primarily syllable-timed languages, whose syllable duration is less varied, are in conversation with speakers of primarily stress-timed languages. Do speakers of syllable-timed backgrounds integrate their turns rhythmically into the stress-timed pattern? If so, how are those continuations realised? The data show that rhythmic patterns are indeed continued across speaker transitions, however, only in up to half of all turn transitions, and predominantly only for the first stressed syllable of the turn. This suggests that incoming speakers of the syllable-timed language initially comply with the tendency towards rhythmic alignment before continuing ‘in their own time’.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.09.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037821660900232X,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

The influence of L1 translation familiarity on the interference effects in foreign language vocabulary learning,"In this study, we investigated the role of first language (L1) information in learning semantically related second language (L2) words. Research suggests that L2 learners have difficulty in learning semantically related L2 words in paired-associate learning because those semantically related words cause interference effects between them. Research also suggests that, in paired-associate learning, the degree to which the learners are familiar with the response items plays an important role in making the association. Taken together, we conducted two experiments in which semantically related L2 words and their L1 translations were used as stimulus and response items respectively. We compared the learning of different types of word pairs that have L1 translation words with different degrees of L1 word familiarity to (a) test the influence of L1 translation familiarity on interference effects and (b) assess the viability of this commonly used technique in foreign language classrooms. Native Japanese speakers attempted to learn 15 antonymous L2 word pairs with either familiar or non-familiar L1 translations. The results of the study suggest that the degree of interference in learning L2 antonymous pairs differs, depending upon the differences in the familiarity with the L1 translated words in the L2 word pairs.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.03.015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000746,manual_search[system]
"Taguchi, Naoko Gomez-Laich, Maria Pia Arrufat-Marques, Maria-Jose",2016,Comprehension of Indirect Meaning in Spanish as a Foreign Language,"Abstract This study investigated comprehension of indirect meaning among learners of L2 Spanish via an original computer-delivered multimedia listening test. The comprehension of implied speaker intention is a type of indirect communication that involves the ability to understand implied intention by using linguistic knowledge, contextual cues, and the assumption of relevance (Taguchi, 2005, 2011). Since inferential processing involves parallel processing of all available signals, both linguistic and nonlinguistic, to interpret the indirect utterance (Sperber & Wilson, 1995), it is essential to incorporate multimedia input. By creating a multimedia comprehension test in Spanish, the study examined theoretical claims about inferential mechanisms and their applicability to L2 comprehension. Thirty-two L2 Spanish learners in intermediate/advanced Spanish classes at a private U.S. university and 21 native Spanish speakers completed a listening test that assessed comprehension of three types of indirect meaning: indirect refusals, indirect opinions, and irony. These item types differed in terms of the degree of conventionality encoded and the extent of inferencing required for comprehension. Participants? comprehension was analyzed for accuracy and comprehension speed. Results revealed a significant difference in L2 Spanish learners? comprehension accuracy scores and response times across the three item types. Irony was the most difficult to comprehend for L2 Spanish learners. Conventionality did not facilitate comprehension because indirect refusals and opinions had the same accuracy scores. In terms of response times, indirect opinions were faster to comprehend than indirect refusals and irony items. Posthoc retrospective verbal interviews revealed that learners used a wide a range of verbal, nonverbal, and contextual cues to make inferences of indirect meaning.",,10.1111/flan.12230,https://doi.org/10.1111/flan.12230,manual_search[foreign_language_annals]

"Truscott, John",2010,Further thoughts on Anthony Bruton’s critique of the correction debate,"In this response I discuss several points that Bruton made in his own response paper. I first argue that his main theme, that design factors should be emphasized over statistical analysis, has never been a genuine issue; it is two independent issues, and for each of them I have some concerns about his discussion. I then consider his comments on our respective “points of departure”. If I have one, it is not at all what he says it is, and I find his own point of departure problematic in several respects. I also discuss, more briefly, three additional issues: his earlier accusations that I “misrepresent” the work of others and “inexplicably” fail to mention aspects of the research that might be troublesome for the case against correction, the ecological validity of research on correction, and explanations for the fact that some learners become highly skilled second language writers. I then offer a perspective on the state of the correction debate.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.10.003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X1000120X,manual_search[system]
"Truscott, John",2010,Some thoughts on Anthony Bruton’s critique of the correction debate,"In a recent paper, Anthony Bruton argued that correction receives too much attention and that the debate over it (which he calls “the Truscott debate”) is “a rather tedious sterile academic debate” that has harmed the field. He dismissed the case against correction, based on arguments that uncorrected students do not improve, some general objections to the research evidence, and a claim that in presenting it I omitted troublesome information and misrepresented one of the relevant studies. His alternative view is that common sense tells us correcting students’ errors is appropriate. In this response I address these points, emphasizing his comments on the evidence and the way I presented it. I conclude that he has not provided any substantive support for his claims and that his comments do not alter the conclusion that correction is a failure and has no place in second language writing classes.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.03.014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10000400,manual_search[system]
"Tsai, Mei-Hui",2010,Managing topics of birth and death in doctor–patient communication,"The birth and death of family members, as two contrastive human experiences, have different effects with regard to people's needs for social support and freedom from imposition. While topics of birth and death inevitably arise in medical consultations where doctors collect information about patients’ family history, little has been explored regarding how birth/death information is presented in spontaneous discourse. By examining 49 Taiwanese medical encounters between doctors and their elderly patients, this research observed the following. While the topic of birth and the birth information about the patient's family member is explicitly introduced or elicited via doctor's questions formulated with the birth core lexicon in Southern Min “senn/give birth to” (e.g., “how many children did you give birth to?”), discourse on death is not. Rather than being explicitly asked for, most information about patients’ deceased family members gets presented as responses to doctor's questions formulated with “a syntactical subject only” (e.g., “…and your husband?”) or conveying a positive assumption of a family member still being alive (e.g., “how old are your parents?”). These findings lead to my main argument that the face-threatening effects associated with death are balanced by posing an ambiguous question which opens a wide possibility for patients to volunteer death-related information which they perceive as relevant to the ongoing discourse, or by assuming the survival status of a family member and leaving the situation open for patients to confirm or correct this.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.09.012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002434,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Tse, Polly Hyland, Ken",2010,Claiming a territory: Relative clauses in journal descriptions,"The study of evaluative features of language has been a productive source of insights into academic discourse in recent years, revealing the ways that persuasion is achieved in a range of genres. This research, however, has largely focused on word-level features, such as stance adverbials and evaluative adjectives (e.g. Hunston and Thompson, 2000), with the evaluative potential of clause-level resources under-explored. Nor has research had much to tell us about the more peripheral genres of the academy which are concerned with the distribution, rather than the production, of knowledge. In this paper we address both these issues by examining the role of the relative clause construction in a corpus of journal descriptions, the texts which define and endorse the goals and position of a journal. Our analysis of 200 journal descriptions in four contrasting disciplines reveals that relative clauses have an important, and perhaps surprising, role to play in this genre, functioning pragmatically as an evaluative and persuasive tool to promote academic journals.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.12.025,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610000032,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

The analysis identifies interactional processes that contribute to expert–novice differentiation during team meetings that take place as part of an electrical and computer engineering course. Through analysis of data from the team interaction, participant perspectives, and ethnographic context, it is demonstrated that the NS takes on an expert identity, while the NNS takes on a novice identity as the NS and NNS engage in face-to-face interaction with each other. This expert–novice differentiation specifically occurs through the process of ratification, failure to ratify, and rejection of contributions. The NS's ability to gain expert status is linked to prior access to opportunities to participate in engineering teams and the forms of talk involved therein, which the NNS did not have access to. Conclusions indicate that this expert–novice relationship is not inherent to the NS–NNS relationship but that novice linguistically based identity has a bearing on the achievement of an expert non-linguistically based identity.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.05.010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609001180,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

Test-takers were videotaped while taking a video listening test, and the rate they viewed the video screen was analyzed and correlated with test performance and attitudes toward the use of video texts. The results suggest that these test-takers viewed the video texts less than half of the time, and there was a weak negative correlation between viewing rate and test performance.

Focusing quantitatively and qualitatively on scientific English achievement, the paper addresses the content or cognitive–academic dimension, so far as underrepresented in English-as-foreign-language research, as is senior secondary school immersion itself. While no direct cause-effect relationship between the program and achievement levels was to be claimed, the observed differences between program participants and non-participants were ultimately minimal. Reasons proposed for the intervention’s outcome seemed mainly related to key stakeholders’ apparent limited awareness of cognitive–academic language and its development.

"Wang, Yu-Fang Tsai, Pi-Hua Yang, Ya-Ting",2010,"Objectivity, subjectivity and intersubjectivity: Evidence from qishi (‘actually’) and shishishang (‘in fact’) in spoken Chinese","The present study delves into the idiosyncrasies of qishi and its near synonym—shishishang in spoken Chinese, by adopting the conversation analysis approach (Sacks et al., 1974) and working with a spoken corpus containing daily conversations and TV/radio interviews. Based on relevance theory (Sperber and Wilson, 1986/1995) and politeness theory (Brown and Levinson, 1987), this study analyzes the textual and interactional uses of qishi and shishishang. The data show that as discourse markers, they serve several pragmatic functions such as correcting, informing, or shifting topic. On the whole, qishi and shishishang could be regarded as signals for guiding the listener toward a particular interpretation intended by the speaker (Sperber and Wilson, 1986/1995). Furthermore, echoing Traugott and Dasher's analysis of in fact (2002:155), we find that qishi and shishishang, particularly the former, are intersubjective in that they have the double function of signaling the type of rhetorical strategy being used, and at the same time expressing concern for the addressee's “face” (Brown and Levinson, 1987). This study also indicates that the discourse markers qishi and shishishang are more prevalent in formal speech settings, such as TV/radio interviews, where politeness is expected.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.07.011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609001842,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

This study reports on the curriculum making practices of three capable, experienced teachers of adult ESOL in high, medium and low-constraint contexts over the duration of one complete course for each teacher. Through iterative interviewing and analysis of curriculum documents, it details the tentativeness and sketchiness of teachers’ written planning (particularly in the pre-course phase). It goes on to describe how teachers’ plans were constantly revised in response to the powerful influence of learner feedback, received through explicit negotiations and responses as well as their own perceptions about the way the instructional curriculum was being received. Teachers in all three types of instructional context responded to learners’ developmental and affective needs in a variety of ways, and to the fullest extent possible within the constraints of their teaching situations and their own theories of best practice. Study findings indicate the importance of assisting novice teachers to acquire awareness and abilities in this area as a goal for second language teacher education.

"Williams, Howard",2010,Implicit attribution,"Writing classes and style manuals consistently emphasize proper source acknowledgment in published writing (hence also in student work). Though attribution is commonly held to be of paramount importance on ethical and other grounds, published writers regularly manage to dispense with explicitness about the use of source material in the course of a text. That is, attribution is often merely implicit – sometimes so weakly so that a scrutinizing reader may be unsure whether it even exists. How is such discourse possible, given the usual strictures? Reports on two data collections based on reader judgments, in which readers are shown to use textual organization (heading, paragraph structure) cues in inferring the presence or absence of attribution, help suggest answers to this question. The stated need to attribute is argued to be highly conditional, based more on a principle of assessed risk than on a categorical requirement of the type normally taught in expository writing classes. This risk-based principle may help account for the minimal use of attribution in certain genres of writing (e.g., basic-level textbooks, newspapers and high-circulation magazines) and its maximal use in others (e.g., scholarly journals).",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.07.013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609001982,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

"Wong, Jock",2010,The “triple articulation” of language,"In this paper, I argue that a language has three “faces” – form, meaning, and culture – and hence pragmemes are best analysed with respect to a cultural context. Using examples of culturally embedded pragmemes from Singapore English, I demonstrate how their use is intimately associated with culture-specific ways of thinking, which in many instances go against widely accepted paradigms like Grice's maxims and Brown & Levinson's politeness principles. My data suggest that Singapore English routinely blurs the distinction between opinion and fact and that opinions are often presented as if they are facts, which goes against the maxim of quality, which requires people not to say that for which they lack evidence. I additionally show how some of these culture-specific ways of thinking may be articulated in ways that reflect an insider perspective. Finally, I propose that we go one step further to talk about the “triple articulation” of language, which views language as a three-tiered entity, comprising form, meaning, and culture. This idea of what language is about goes beyond lexicon and grammar to include non-formal features like conversational routines, frequency of use of certain expressions, the avoidance of certain ways of speaking, pragmemes, etc., which can only be satisfactorily explained with reference to culture. A person who is supposed to have learned a language without understanding its culture has at best mastered its lexicon and grammar. They have not mastered the “essence” of the language.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2010.06.013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610001852,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]
"Wong, May L.-Y.",2010,Expressions of gratitude by Hong Kong speakers of English: Research from the International Corpus of English in Hong Kong (ICE-HK),"Expressions of gratitude often occur as functional lexical chunks such as thanks and thank you (Coulmas, 1981). In this paper, I will focus on the use of such units and longer formulaic sequences of gratitude such as thanks a lot and thank you very much, relying on data from the Hong Kong component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-HK). The results show that Hong Kong speakers of English do not employ the wide variety of thanking strategies that has been investigated in previous literature. Their expressions of gratitude are usually brief, with thanks and thank you being the commonest forms of gratitude expression. These forms are frequently used as closing signals; they often constitute a complete turn. Repetitive gratitude formulae and expressions of appreciation of the interlocutors (both in a single turn and across turns) are exceedingly rare, which suggests that the Chinese may be too reserved to express their gratitude openly and explicitly. Responses to an act of thanking seem to be infrequent in ICE-HK and only a few strategies are represented. The paper also considers the pedagogical implications of the way this function can be acquired in a second/foreign language with the help of the corpus findings.",,10.1016/j.pragma.2009.09.022,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216609002537,manual_search[journal_of_pragmatics]

Results indicate that, throughout the three-year programme, there was unevenness in growth across these various dimensions of practical knowledge, which appeared to influence the teacher’s developing self-efficacy in using groupwork in various ways. After exploring possible reasons for this, I discuss implications.",,10.1016/j.system.2010.09.012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X10001120,manual_search[system]

"Zhang, Dongbo Yang, Xuexue",2016,Chinese L2 Learners’ Depth of Vocabulary Knowledge and Its Role in Reading Comprehension,"Abstract Using a Chinese Word Associates Test (WAT-C), this study examined the vocabulary depth of second language learners of Chinese and its contribution to the learners? reading comprehension. Results showed no significant effects of word frequency, word class (i.e., adjectives vs. verbs), and type of association relationships (i.e., paradigmatic vs. syntagmatic) on learners? WAT-C performance. More important, vocabulary depth was found to be a significant and unique predictor of reading comprehension over and above vocabulary size. On the other hand, the relative contributions of vocabulary depth and size depended on what types of texts were read and what comprehension skills were assessed. Specifically, for the long passage comprehension task with questions testing literal comprehension, vocabulary size was a more important predictor, whereas for the short passage comprehension task with questions testing inferencing, vocabulary depth was a more important predictor. These findings were discussed in light of the different levels of lexical complexity between the short and long passages and the different cognitive processing demands the questions of the two comprehension tasks placed on learners.",,10.1111/flan.12225,https://doi.org/10.1111/flan.12225,manual_search[foreign_language_annals]

Beliefs about the nature of language learning, the role of the teacher, the role of feedback, language learning strategies, and self-efficacy were examined through survey instruments. The main research focus was on the difficulties perceived by distance language learners, their readiness for autonomous approaches to English learning, and the differences in beliefs between beginner distance learners and those with more distance education experience. It was found that the majority of the participants perceived insufficient communication with teachers and peer students as the dominant difficulty in distance learning, and that distance language learning was more difficult than traditional classroom language learning. Results also revealed that distance language learners with more distance learning experience believed more strongly in the benefits of an autonomous approach to learning and had a lower degree of anxiety and frustration than those at beginner level.",,10.1016/j.system.2009.12.003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X09001419,manual_search[system]
