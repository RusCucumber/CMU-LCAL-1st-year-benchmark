AB  - This paper analyzes the use of evaluative language in twenty native Spanish speakers’ oral narrations of the pear film (Chafe, 1980) in light of Mey's (2001) proposal that pragmatic acts must be looked at from the point of view of the speaker and his/her experience and background knowledge, as well as the language used in performing the pragmatic act itself. Evaluative utterances in the narratives are viewed as instances of ‘situated speech acts’ (Mey, 2001) rendered possible on account of the speakers’ underlying assumptions and contextual factors. Analysis of the discourse reveals a tendency by some of the narrators to explicitly verbalize their points of view by sharing their thoughts about, reactions to, and appraisals of specific elements in the film. In addition, several of the speakers evaluated the behaviors of the characters in the film by passing judgment on and/or criticizing the appropriateness or correctness of their actions. Other evaluations involved the attribution of features and properties of entities that were not explicitly part of the cotext. The inclusion of these attributes, it is argued, reflects the fact that they contrasted in some way with the speaker's preconceived idea of what is expected, ordinary, or normal. This study shows how observed tendencies in the narrators’ use of evaluation are constrained by the background knowledge of the narrators and the social relationships between the narrators and the interlocutors, characterized in terms of the relationship of power and the social distance between speaker and addressee. Together, these factors make up the context in which acts of evaluation are possible and thus help define the pragmeme of evaluation.

AB  - There is a crucial difference in the way economists and linguists approach metaphor in economics, the former being mostly interested in the representation of knowledge in the discipline, while the latter more concerned with the discursive and communicative context in which metaphors are used. The present paper attempts to bring together the two perspectives to analyze the CONTAINER metaphor in economics textbooks. Thus, the identification and analysis of highly metaphorical terms of the discipline will serve to determine the conceptual areas in which metaphor plays an important role, whereas a textual analysis will demonstrate how this metaphorical content is laid out for novice readers in the discourse of the introductory textbook. This article suggests that the CONTAINER metaphor is a rhetorical device, like the passive voice or hypotheticality, used to convey the idea of depersonalization and objectification.

AB  - This paper deals with pre-election discourse in Hungary identifying complex argumentative moves that call for modifications in traditional research methodologies. Based on theoretical studies and real-life public debates a fine-grained analysis is offered to discern substantive arguments from presumptive arguments. The assessment of politicians’ argumentative practices takes into account both the critical-rationalist and the pragma-dialectical perspectives on reasoned discussion. The results show that presumptions function as special kinds of inferences grounded in considerations related to the context or circumstances in which the inferences are to be drawn. Presumptive reasoning is shown to be a paradigm case of rational activity in assessing the expectations of others. In the analysis of political discourse the aim is to find out what beliefs electors entertain and how their positions on certain issues get influenced by politicians’ arguments. Thus, the paper offers a new look at the notion of rational discussion. The early bed-rock certainty of the pragma-dialectical approach to argumentation as a prime example of normative pragmatics seems to be losing its primacy: at best we can try to adhere to a mixture of a critical-rationalistic view of reasonableness and the dialectical notion of reasonableness in real-life debates and public argumentations.

AB  - In this article two arguments are given in support of a maxim of politeness. The first argument is that assuming a maxim is part of the best explanation of polite behaviour, considering the problems, which Brown and Levinson's theory and Fraser and Nolen's conversational contract theory have, and which a maxim-based theory does not have. The second argument is that the maxim of politeness is part of rational conversation among potentially aggressive parties. This leads to a new Gricean theory of politeness: the maxim of politeness is seen as an additional conversational maxim under the Cooperative Principle in rational conversations among potentially aggressive parties. The content of the maxim is then determined face-theoretically, incorporating some of Brown and Levinson's ideas into the Gricean theory.

We argue that at least four types of indirections can be recognized: stance indirection, topic indirection, participation indirection, and production indirection. We then exemplify these different forms of indirection through the analysis of three examples.

AB  - A large number of studies have been carried out on second/foreign language learners’ identities, but there seems to be insufficient research on the constitutive effect of discourse on L2 learners’ identities, especially among English learners in China. Informed by discourse theory, this study explored how college students’ identities were discursively constructed in and through their English learning experiences. This study identified the discursive strategies of establishing oppositions and differences that the students adopted in identity construction as they interacted within the specific learning community, the surrounding social environment and an imagined global community. The paper starts by discussing the constructs that guide the study and then provides an interpretation of the extracts from interviews and diary studies in a way that takes account of the socio-cultural context in which the investigation takes place.

AB  - This paper reports on results of a conversation analytic study of gestures used to initiate repair in ESL conversational tutoring sessions. These gestures function in similar ways to verbal “open class” (Drew, 1997) repair initiators such as “huh?” They are unaccompanied by verbal initiations, i.e., the nonverbal behavior alone is understood to be initiating repair. One gesture consists of a sharp head turn or head tilt to the side, with continued eyegaze on the recipient, sometimes accompanied by a widening of the eyes. The other is a head poke forward, accompanied with a movement of the upper body forward toward the recipient. The gestures are used by both the native speaker (NS) tutor and the non-native speaker (NNS) tutee, and they are most often understood by the recipients to involve problems in understanding the prior talk. At least one of the gestures can also be used in a pedagogically specific way to prompt self-correction. The gestures are initiated in the turn transition space after the trouble source, and they are held through the following turn(s) of talk until the problem is resolved. This paper adds to our understanding of both conversational repair and the use of gesture in native/non-native talk.

AB  - As Quine (1953) taught us, from (1) and (2) we cannot infer (3):(1)Giorgione was so-called because of his size(2)Giorgione was Barbarelli(3)Barbarelli was so-called because of his size.Why? In this paper I discuss and dismiss two possible answers. The first answer (section 1) rests on the view that in a sentence like (1)—a Giorgione-sentence—the name ‘Giorgione’ plays a dual role, i.e. it is both used and mentioned, and, since it is mentioned, it cannot be substituted salva veritate by the coreferential name ‘Barbarelli’. The second answer (section 2) dismisses the dual role of the name. It proposes the view that the name ‘Giorgione’ is picked out by the pronoun ‘so’ working like a demonstrative. In section 3 I present a plausible Perry-inspired account—i.e. I take on board Perry's distinction between an utterance's referential truth conditions and its reflexive truth conditions—which enables us to solve Frege-inspired puzzles concerning cognitive significance. Finally, in section 4, I discuss and defend the view that in a Giorgione-sentence ‘so’ works as an anaphoric pronoun coindexed with the name ‘Giorgione’. This anaphoric link and coindexation, though, appears at a reflexive level. This solution rests on the view that at the surface level the name is merely used while at the reflexive level, it is mentioned.11The picture I propose is neutral vis-à-vis any particular theory of quotation. For my argument to work, it is sufficient that the NPs appear within quotation marks at the cognitive level. I also show how the account proposed elegantly deals with so-called simple sentences of the form “Clark Kent, unlike Superman, can’t fly”, “Superman is stronger/more successful/…than Clark Kent”. In these sentences, codesignative NPs do not seem to be substitutable salva veritate. As in Giorgione-sentences, it is shown that their apparent non-substitutability is best dealt with at the reflexive level. The picture I’ll end up proposing endorses the welcome consequence that in Giorgione-sentences, unlike in simple sentences, codesignative names cannot be replaced salva veritate. Yet in simple sentences the intuitions concerning their alleged non-substitutivity are dealt with at the reflexive level. Thus, these intuitions force us neither to invoke special modes of presentation entering the proposition expressed nor to enrich our ontology and claim that coreferential names can refer to different entities in various contexts.

AB  - Routinely, in a corpus of videotaped employment interviews, the interviewer invites laughter. The interviewee laughs along. The interviewer may produce a next laughable or briefly topicalize the laughable materials, but the interviewee does not do so. Rather, the interviewee will wait for the interviewer to take the lead in returning them to the business of the interview. The asymmetries evident in the sequential organization of these shared laughs show participant orientation to respective institutional roles. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous research examining doctor–patient and survey interviewer–respondent interactions. While laughing together might appear to reduce power distance and bring participants together, the organization and distribution of these shared laughter instances reflect and reinscribe the hegemony of the roles of interviewer and interviewee.

AB  - The present study delves into the idiosyncrasies of qishi and its near synonym—shishishang in spoken Chinese, by adopting the conversation analysis approach (Sacks et al., 1974) and working with a spoken corpus containing daily conversations and TV/radio interviews. Based on relevance theory (Sperber and Wilson, 1986/1995) and politeness theory (Brown and Levinson, 1987), this study analyzes the textual and interactional uses of qishi and shishishang. The data show that as discourse markers, they serve several pragmatic functions such as correcting, informing, or shifting topic. On the whole, qishi and shishishang could be regarded as signals for guiding the listener toward a particular interpretation intended by the speaker (Sperber and Wilson, 1986/1995). Furthermore, echoing Traugott and Dasher's analysis of in fact (2002:155), we find that qishi and shishishang, particularly the former, are intersubjective in that they have the double function of signaling the type of rhetorical strategy being used, and at the same time expressing concern for the addressee's “face” (Brown and Levinson, 1987). This study also indicates that the discourse markers qishi and shishishang are more prevalent in formal speech settings, such as TV/radio interviews, where politeness is expected.

AB  - Developments in characterizing discourse communities and their various genres are hoped to provide more insight into the nature of language in use. Such characterizations gradually tend to include the rhetorical and less visible aspects of different genres in different discourse communities. The trend seems rewarding due to the multilingual membership in discourse communities and inevitability of interference from speech communities. Although several studies have tried to describe the distribution and nature of metadiscourse marking across disciplines and languages, no systematic attempt was made, to our knowledge, to introduce a practical model that presumably guides the users in the real time of writing. By analyzing metadiscourse samples from the genre of research article of academic discourse community, this study embarks on introducing a tentative model based on Gricean cooperative principle (CP) that is hoped to help the multilingual members of academic discourse community in the use of metadiscourse markers. The Gricean categories of CP, developed here, are hoped to provide a practical framework that informs how to use rather than how is it used of metadiscourse in writing research articles. Such a model can be assumed an improvement against coarse-grained holistic guides for the use of metadiscourse offered by previous studies. The attempt also led to a new classification of metadiscourse and added two new metadiscourse strategies of collapsers and disclaimers.

AB  - The present study examined politeness phenomenon in Spanish discourse produced between a therapist and a client during psychotherapeutic motivational interviews as depression and adherence to medication are discussed. In particular, this study examined the mitigation strategies and indirect speech acts used by the interactants. Mitigation has been defined as a modification of a speech act that softens the message for its hearer (Fraser, 1980:341). Several devices such as shields, hedges, parenthetical verbs and proverbial sayings were observed in this discursive context in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. This study also revealed that the use of mitigating devices on the part of the therapist was conditioned by his intentions to attain his goals: to indirectly motivate the client to continue with treatment. The qualitative analysis revealed how references to persons varied and how the Latino cultural notions of el qúe dirán and guardar las apariencias posited by Placencia (1996) emerged in this discursive context. Although mitigating features have been investigated in Spanish (Bravo, 2008, Haverkate, 1990, Hernández Flores, 1999, Murillo Medrano, 2002, Placencia, 1996, among others), overall they remain relatively under investigated in Spanish psychotherapeutic discourse.

AB  - Expressions of gratitude often occur as functional lexical chunks such as thanks and thank you (Coulmas, 1981). In this paper, I will focus on the use of such units and longer formulaic sequences of gratitude such as thanks a lot and thank you very much, relying on data from the Hong Kong component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-HK). The results show that Hong Kong speakers of English do not employ the wide variety of thanking strategies that has been investigated in previous literature. Their expressions of gratitude are usually brief, with thanks and thank you being the commonest forms of gratitude expression. These forms are frequently used as closing signals; they often constitute a complete turn. Repetitive gratitude formulae and expressions of appreciation of the interlocutors (both in a single turn and across turns) are exceedingly rare, which suggests that the Chinese may be too reserved to express their gratitude openly and explicitly. Responses to an act of thanking seem to be infrequent in ICE-HK and only a few strategies are represented. The paper also considers the pedagogical implications of the way this function can be acquired in a second/foreign language with the help of the corpus findings.

AB  - Research in conversation analysis has shown that speech rhythm is a relevant parameter for turn-taking amongst native speakers of British English. Not only is individual participants’ speech rhythmically structured, but rhythmic patterns also continue across speaker transitions. Participants employ such rhythmic integration as an interactional resource. By rhythmically integrating next turns into prior turns they display conversational alignment with previous speakers, whereas non-integration is treated as noticeable and non-default. British English has a tendency towards stress-timing, that is, stressed syllables occur at roughly regular intervals in time, with great variation in syllable duration. This paper investigates whether cross-transitional speech rhythm also occurs when speakers of primarily syllable-timed languages, whose syllable duration is less varied, are in conversation with speakers of primarily stress-timed languages. Do speakers of syllable-timed backgrounds integrate their turns rhythmically into the stress-timed pattern? If so, how are those continuations realised? The data show that rhythmic patterns are indeed continued across speaker transitions, however, only in up to half of all turn transitions, and predominantly only for the first stressed syllable of the turn. This suggests that incoming speakers of the syllable-timed language initially comply with the tendency towards rhythmic alignment before continuing ‘in their own time’.

Recent developments in linguistics, especially the inclusion of cognitive aspects like the necessary individuality of knowledge and the ongoing process of knowledge construction, challenge some of the traditional concepts in this field such as the concept of abstract sublanguages. These developments make it relevant to introduce approaches with a different focus as a supplement to the traditional approaches in order to achieve a fuller picture of domain-specific communication. By way of a specific example (a study of the concept Mord in Swiss criminal law), the empirical part of the paper shows which additional aspects of communication in the field of law become visible if we supplement the traditional approaches with approaches focusing on cognition and individual knowledge construction.

As many are aware (including the journalists who report day by day on Barack Obama's achievements), Obama uses the technique of ‘personification’11Personification is an ontological metaphor in which a thing or abstraction is represented as a person. (The Economist, December 13th, 2007). When he voices an idea, he does not just expose it as if it came from himself, but gets another person (fictitious or, plausibly, real) to voice it. Since in an electoral speech, he cannot reasonably get people on stage to voice his ideas, he personifies ideas by narrating what people told him. His stories are his way of personifying his ideas. The discourse strategy he uses serves to reverse the direction of influence from the people in control to the people controlled (see Van Dijk, 2003). In this paper, I also argue that Barack Obama's speech contains echoes of Martin Luther King Jr's ‘I have a dream speech’ and that its structure is best understood in the light of Afro-American sermons. I explain analogies and disanalogies.

AB  - This study attempts to identify strategies peculiar to speakers of non-standard varieties of American English when composing with speech recognition-based dictation software. Two speakers of African American Vernacular English and one non-native speaker of English were asked to orally compose a series of college-level writing tasks using ViaVoice 98. The findings indicate that when the software misrecognized their speech, the language minority students resorted to similar strategies as those of standard American speakers discussed in the literature such as speaker adaptation to recognition systems leading to hyperarticulation and other types of phonetic and lexical adjustments. Moreover, the participants based their strategies on their knowledge of human-to-human interaction (e.g., the sequential organization of talk), which more often than not proved to be useless when interacting with the software. Yet, the students did seem to build up an awareness during the speech sessions of their linguistic variety and its divergence from the standard American accent that the software was originally modeled after. The findings of this study offer a better understanding of some of the strategies that speakers from diverse ethno-linguistic backgrounds may employ when speaking to write with speech recognition-based dictation software. They also offer some insight into users’ assumptions about the capabilities of the system, i.e., what they believed the speech-based software could process in terms of utterance length, tone of voice, canonical pronunciation, and lexical items.

AB  - Compliment responding (CR) is one of the most studied speech acts in pragmatics. CR in Chinese, in particular, has enjoyed considerable attention from students of pragmatics. Chen (1993) finds that Chinese compliment responses (CRs) are characterized by rejection, whereby speakers typically denigrate the object of the compliment when they respond to compliments. Since then, studies on Chinese CRs have yielded a wide range of results, suggesting that the CR behavior of Chinese is a very complicated phenomenon, although, on the whole, rejection still seems a defining feature of Chinese CRs. In this paper, we report on a quasi-longitudinal study of CRs in Chinese. The study replicates Chen (1993), adopting the same instrument, in the same research site (Xi’an, China), with a similar subject population. Using the findings of Chen (1993) as a baseline for comparison, the study reveals drastic changes in the way Xi’an Chinese responding to compliments. That is, instead of overwhelmingly rejecting compliments as reported in Chen (1993), Xi’an Chinese are now found to overwhelmingly accept compliments. In fact, they accept compliments as much as do speakers of many Western languages such as English and German. We attribute this change to the influx of Western cultural influences that has occurred in the City of Xi’an since the early 1990s. We will also discuss the significance and implications of our work, which is possibly the first longitudinal study in pragmatics.

Results show that participants observed their behavioral expectations in this context expressing empathy, involvement and respect. They also respected the interlocutor's identity and respectability face, which, is argued here, reflected positively on their own identity and respectability face. Their interactional goals were strongly relational and, although there was a short transactional goal interspersed in the interaction, it only reflected and emphasized their interdependent self-construals of self (Markus and Kitayama, 1991). Gender differences showed females favoring the expression of empathy while males favored the expression of respect.

Three hypotheses are tested: I. If a language encodes the distinction between two adjacent statuses on the hierarchy, it will also encode distinctions between higher statuses; II. All languages encode distinctions between the two highest statuses, ‘in focus’ and ‘activated’; III. Languages will not have forms that encode the set difference between two statuses. Results of the study provide support for all three hypotheses.

AB  - In the context of the globalization and localization of business, it is becoming increasingly important to better understand the cross-linguistic persuasive communication conveyed through electronic media. This study compares 40 Chinese and 40 English direct-marketing sales e-mails. These 80 e-mails were randomly selected from a database of 7664 sales e-mails collected from 36 categories of recipients in Hong Kong over a six-month period. Based on a Cross-linguistic Socio-cultural Model proposed by the author, this study investigates the similarities and differences in the encoding of persuasive messages in the two corpora. It considers how far the similarities can be attributed to generic considerations, that is, to the contextual configuration of the field, mode, and tenor of the texts, as well as how far the differences can be attributed to the social and cultural contexts of those texts with regard to their audience, purpose, and content. Depending on the rhetorical goals the makers wish to achieve through these texts, the viewer–maker relationships they would like to establish, and the social and cultural contexts in which the texts unfold, the sales genre is likely to adapt in terms of its discourse strategy and textual features in today's marketplace, which is experiencing not only increased globalization, but also increased localization.

AB  - The study of evaluative features of language has been a productive source of insights into academic discourse in recent years, revealing the ways that persuasion is achieved in a range of genres. This research, however, has largely focused on word-level features, such as stance adverbials and evaluative adjectives (e.g. Hunston and Thompson, 2000), with the evaluative potential of clause-level resources under-explored. Nor has research had much to tell us about the more peripheral genres of the academy which are concerned with the distribution, rather than the production, of knowledge. In this paper we address both these issues by examining the role of the relative clause construction in a corpus of journal descriptions, the texts which define and endorse the goals and position of a journal. Our analysis of 200 journal descriptions in four contrasting disciplines reveals that relative clauses have an important, and perhaps surprising, role to play in this genre, functioning pragmatically as an evaluative and persuasive tool to promote academic journals.

(2) The aforementioned strategy together with acknowledgement of responsibility formed the most frequent combination of apology strategies in this language. (3) The same set of apology strategies used in other investigated languages was common in Persian; however, preferences for using these strategies appeared to be culture-specific.

AB  - This paper investigates hyperbolic expressions of emotion in Mandarin Chinese conversations in Taiwan for two dimensions: how hyperbole is realized via a variety of syntactic devices based on metaphor, and how hyperbole takes affective stance to evidence speakers’ intersubjectification. It is shown that syntactic devices utilized to render hyperbole include polysyndeton, extreme case formulation, resultative verb construction, and four-word idiomatic construction. Highly understood in metaphorical senses, hyperbolic expressions of emotion have rich data revealing that hyperbole draws on metaphor as a bedrock mechanism. This paper argues that it is the analogical and imaginative capacities of metaphor that opens up possibility for speakers to talk about exaggerative interpretations of events, which further increase speakers’ intersubjectification to indicate their stance for interactive purposes.

In terms of syntactic forms, the study finds that in comparison with Australian students, Cantonese students in their L2 adopt fewer syntactic types in making suggestions. In addition, their suggestions are less likely to be embedded in elliptical or complex sentences but more likely to be preceded by textual themes and interpersonal metaphors. In terms of pragmatic strategies, Cantonese students resemble Australian students in their choices of perspective, directness and politeness in general. However, they show significant differences in their choices of suggestion strategies and redressive actions. Some of these differences resemble the preferential difference between the two languages while some reflect the subjects’ language competence. These observations call for further research and changes in the language classroom as well as language materials.

AB  - This paper contributes to the debate on the precise nature of face as a universal phenomenon, and the cultural variability within it. Specifically, we bring the ‘Southern’ perspective to the debate by discussing the previously neglected African dimension. Recent scholarship suggests that the concept of face and the notion of self in traditional African culture may have more in common with Eastern collectivist cultures than with Anglo-American culture. We examine the interactional management of an encounter between a Zimbabwean English speaker and British English speakers in a community singing group. We argue that, while face needs may be universally relevant in such a situation, the way in which they are oriented to in interaction depends on cultural understandings of which aspects of face are paramount in particular circumstances. Since these assumptions are deep-seated and invisible they are not easily open to explicit negotiation and hence can lead to misinterpretation. By conducting an ethnographic study of the communicative event and combining it with a detailed examination of the co-construction of meaning in this interaction, we show how the participants’ contributions can be related to differing – and potentially conflicting – interpretation frameworks. These frameworks are informed by culture-specific notions of appropriate self-presentation.

AB  - The Korean sentence-ender –ta has been studied in linguistics as a grammatical element marking declarative sentences. Contributing to recent studies that have proposed –ta's functions in discourse, this study examines –ta's different boundary tones and argues that they allow speakers to perform different social actions in naturally occurring conversation. Based upon conversation analysis of video- and audio-recorded conversations, this article demonstrates that speakers, by using –ta in a high boundary tone, display the conveyed information as announceable and newsworthy, thereby highlighting newness of the information. Due to these characteristics, -ta utterances are overwhelmingly found in pre-telling sequences in which speakers announce news and within telling sequences in which speakers provide information that they believe is tellable for the development of a telling. By taking into account a boundary tone mapped onto a specific sentence-ender and analyzing in detail naturally occurring interaction with access to non-verbal interaction, the study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of prosody and interaction.

In pragmatic interpretation the cognitive- philosophical line of research appears to put more emphasis on the proposition expressed (e.g. Horn, 2005, Levinson, 2000) while the socio-cultural interactional line (e.g. Verschueren, 1999, Mey, 2001) underscores the importance of allowing socio-cultural context into linguistic analysis. Following the socio-cultural interactional line Mey claimed that the explanatory movement in a theory of pragmatic acts is from the outside in: “the focus is on the environment in which both speaker and hearer find their affordances, such that the entire situation is brought to bear on what can be said in the situation, as well as on what is actually being said (Mey, 2001:221).” In the paper I will argue that from the perspective of SBUs the explanatory movement should go in both directions: from the outside in and from the inside out. This is because SBUs not only fit into and bound to certain situations but they also create and help to maintain those situations.

AB  - I will describe the structural and semantic characteristics of the Spanish causal conjunctions como (as, since), ya que (as, since), and pues (for). I will argue that, unlike predicative causal conjunctions like porque (because), they function as speech event markers. This difference will be related to Peirce's semiotic distinction between symbolic and indexical signs. A speech event will be defined as a three-dimensional event, including a modal, interpersonal and sequential dimension. The three justificational conjunctions give the same indication at the sequential dimension: they identify the speech event as an act of justification. I will show that what further distinguishes the three conjunctions from each other can be analyzed in terms of the other two dimensions. I will argue that pues activates both the modal and the interpersonal dimension, that ya que activates the modal dimension but de-activates the interpersonal dimension, and that como de-activates both the modal and the interpersonal dimension. I will show that this analysis can explain certain typical pragmatic effects, for instance why pues marks the information that follows as new, why ya que allows special uses like irony or is frequently used to introduce quotations, and why como presents the information as taken for granted. In the concluding section, I will argue that the framework is not only suited to describe Spanish causal conjunctions, but has a broader theoretical and descriptive scope.

AB  - As multi-functional devices, discourse connectives have provided fertile ground for language researchers, regardless of theoretical orientation, methodological approach or context of analysis. This study investigates the use of selected discourse connectives in texts produced by companies for purposes of financial disclosure, representing a vital component of corporate communication. The analysis is based on two specially designed corpora of financial disclosure genres mediated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT): earnings presentations, i.e., oral presentations of financial results given by company executives to investment analysts via teleconferencing, and earnings releases, i.e., the written counterpart published on the Internet. Text analysis software was used to generate the quantitative profile of the discourse connectives, while follow-up qualitative analysis in the context of usage provided additional interpretive insights. Overall, the discourse connectives were found to be more frequent in the earnings presentations as compared to the earnings releases, even if they are more typically associated with written prose. Across both corpora, discourse connectives served a range of functions, often foregrounding the positive while attenuating the negative. These findings shed light on the pragmatic uses of discourse connectives by corporate speakers and writers as a way to influence the interpretation of the message, and thus succeed in achieving their professional aims.

AB  - Face Constituting Theory addresses the question “How do participants achieve face in everyday talk?” explaining face and facework as achieved by participants engaged in face-to-face communication in situated relationships.

Using these conceptualizations, Face Constituting Theory explains face as participants’ interpretings of relational connectedness and separateness, conjointly co-constituted in talk/conduct-in-interaction. Face Constituting Theory adds to this explanation a new conceptualization of how of face interpretings are evaluated as threatening to, in stasis, or supportive of relationships, drawing into a single explanation the full range of observations on facework from outright face threat, through face maintenance, to outright face support. Consistent with ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, Face Constituting Theory is framed from the participant's perspective, and applying the theory in examining the achievement of face in an instance of everyday interaction both illustrates the application of the new theory in research, and indicates how it is distinct from the approaches existing theories employ in studying face and facework.

AB  - This paper reports on a study of cultural differences in conversational structure and the expression of apology in German and Australian workplace telephone discourse. While the overall episodic structure of German and Australian telephone conversations was similar, there were differences in content or social orientation. This impacted on both whether and how topics representing high threat to face were aired. Australians preferred to avoid face-threatening acts and, if an apology was required, minimise threat to face by telling half-truths. Germans were more likely to provide a truthful account of events, express disappointment and chastise their interlocutors. While such cultural styles were initially transferred from German into English, the longer German native-speakers interacted with Australian English-speaking colleagues, the more likely they were to hide negative opinions and tell half-truths. At the same time, Australians who interacted with Germans on a daily basis tended to accommodate towards German interactional style in English. This study indicates that further research should be conducted on Australian and German workplace discourse. Such research may further our understanding of stumbling blocks to successful inter-cultural workplace communication and provide insight for the teaching of socio-pragmatics in second language acquisition settings.

AB  - This paper deals with the social practice of indirect reports and treats them as cases of language games. It proposes a number of principles like the following: Paraphrasis/Form Principle The that-clause embedded in the verb ‘say’ is a paraphrasis of what Y said, and meets the following constraints: should Y hear what X said he (Y) had said, he would not take issue with it, as to content, but would approve of it as a fair paraphrasis of his original utterance. Furthermore, he would not object to vocalizing the assertion made out of the words following the complementizer ‘that’ on account of its form/style. Furthermore, it connects such principles with Relevance Theory considerations.

AB  - Based on an analysis of a large group of preposed English finite temporal adverbial clauses (TACs), the present study reveals that a considerable number of them do not serve as a thematic link between preceding discourse and their main clause, which suggests that the characterization of their discourse function on the basis of this link is inadequate. Focusing on their shared role in maintaining the temporal line in narrative discourse, the study proposes to view their use as motivated by an effort to collaborate with the general strategy preferred by language users for comprehending temporal information as suggested by the iconicity assumption. From this point of view, the motivation for using TACs in a preposed position is to override the reader's iconicity assumption by specifying the temporal relationship between the main clause and preceding discourse. Serving this function makes preposed TACs part of the chain of temporal adverbials forming the temporal line of a narrative. In accordance with this understanding of preposed TACs, their postposed counterparts are seen as playing a complementary role—they are used in a postposed position when their temporal information is needed without interfering with the temporal line of a narrative.

KW  - Software-assisted metaphor analysis
AB  - The paper explores the phenomenon of metaphors that occur in close textual adjacency, i.e. as metaphor clusters, but do not share a similar cognitive basis. Clusters frequently mix ontologies and are thus devoid of coherence that can be explained as emerging from a single conceptual metaphor. Evidence to that effect comes from a British corpus (Sun and Guardian) of 675 newspaper commentaries covering the 2004/05 EU referenda (in all, 2574 metaphors). First, it turns out that journalists combine metaphors into complex, yet well-formed arguments on a regular basis, with 39% and 62% of all metaphors respectively occurring in clusters. Even more strikingly, the data reveals that ontologically mixed metaphors account for 76% of all clusters and that almost all of these are straightforwardly comprehensible. This challenges the view of mixed metaphor as awkward language usage. I argue that mixing works because metaphors are typically embedded in separate clauses situated at different temporal, causal, speaker, or belief-related conceptual planes. By consequence, no strong joint processing pressure arises that could result in a perceived clash of metaphorical imagery. Thus, felicitous mixing is a natural by-product of the shifting logic of clauses in complex argumentation. In addition, I present a qualitative typology of how clustering metaphors interact in argumentation. It calls into question the view that conceptual metaphors are the coherence-maintaining device par excellence. While conceptual metaphors may create “internal binding” in ontologically coherent clusters, complementary “external binding” models are needed to explain the mixed clusters (and ultimately for a full explanation of all kinds of metaphor-based argumentation).

AB  - In this paper, I argue that a language has three “faces” – form, meaning, and culture – and hence pragmemes are best analysed with respect to a cultural context. Using examples of culturally embedded pragmemes from Singapore English, I demonstrate how their use is intimately associated with culture-specific ways of thinking, which in many instances go against widely accepted paradigms like Grice's maxims and Brown & Levinson's politeness principles. My data suggest that Singapore English routinely blurs the distinction between opinion and fact and that opinions are often presented as if they are facts, which goes against the maxim of quality, which requires people not to say that for which they lack evidence. I additionally show how some of these culture-specific ways of thinking may be articulated in ways that reflect an insider perspective. Finally, I propose that we go one step further to talk about the “triple articulation” of language, which views language as a three-tiered entity, comprising form, meaning, and culture. This idea of what language is about goes beyond lexicon and grammar to include non-formal features like conversational routines, frequency of use of certain expressions, the avoidance of certain ways of speaking, pragmemes, etc., which can only be satisfactorily explained with reference to culture. A person who is supposed to have learned a language without understanding its culture has at best mastered its lexicon and grammar. They have not mastered the “essence” of the language.

AB  - Brown and Levinson (1978) and Brown and Levinson (1987) is that social distance, power and imposition are the most important factors influencing speakers’ linguistic choices and that there is a positive correlation between these social variables and the degree of indirectness employed. The present study investigates the relationship between social/situational and cultural factors and native and non-native speakers’ requesting behaviour. It examines whether the requestive strategies of English native speakers and of Greek ESL learners follow a similar trend across different social situations. It additionally tests whether the same social situations are perceived and rated similarly by the two groups and the extent to which the speakers’ directness is influenced by familiarity, power and imposition. Results have shown that there are high levels of cross-cultural agreement between the two groups for trends of situational variation but also some cross-cultural disagreement on the specific directness levels employed for given situations. Even though significant differences in the speakers’ assessment of social reality seems to explain the differences in their linguistic choices to some extent, this study argues that power, familiarity and imposition alone do not always decide speakers’ directness. A number of intervening situational and cultural factors need to be taken into account when interpreting speakers’ linguistic choices.

AB  - The present study examines functions of code-switching in Chicano theater, i.e. in writing intended for performance. The investigation focuses on local functions of code-switching. These are functions that can be seen in the text and, as a consequence, can be regarded as meaningful for the audience of the plays. In the study these functions are examined, focusing on five loci in which code-switching is frequent, namely quotations, interjections, reiterations, ‘gaps’ and word/language play. The data of the study consists of three published plays by a Chicana playwright. The study concludes that code-switching fills creative, artistic and stylistic functions in the plays and that it can be used to add emphasis to a certain word or passage, to add another level of meaning, to deepen/intensify a meaning, to clarify, to evoke richer images and to instruct the audience about a particular concept. Code-switching is also used to mark closeness, familiarity, to emphasize bonds, and to include or, on the contrary, to mark distance, break bonds and exclude. Complex identities of the characters as well as the plots of the plays are constructed and developed by means of language. Code-switching is thus used to enhance and support the representation of the characters.

AB  - Writing classes and style manuals consistently emphasize proper source acknowledgment in published writing (hence also in student work). Though attribution is commonly held to be of paramount importance on ethical and other grounds, published writers regularly manage to dispense with explicitness about the use of source material in the course of a text. That is, attribution is often merely implicit – sometimes so weakly so that a scrutinizing reader may be unsure whether it even exists. How is such discourse possible, given the usual strictures? Reports on two data collections based on reader judgments, in which readers are shown to use textual organization (heading, paragraph structure) cues in inferring the presence or absence of attribution, help suggest answers to this question. The stated need to attribute is argued to be highly conditional, based more on a principle of assessed risk than on a categorical requirement of the type normally taught in expository writing classes. This risk-based principle may help account for the minimal use of attribution in certain genres of writing (e.g., basic-level textbooks, newspapers and high-circulation magazines) and its maximal use in others (e.g., scholarly journals).

KW  - Euphemism
AB  - The birth and death of family members, as two contrastive human experiences, have different effects with regard to people's needs for social support and freedom from imposition. While topics of birth and death inevitably arise in medical consultations where doctors collect information about patients’ family history, little has been explored regarding how birth/death information is presented in spontaneous discourse. By examining 49 Taiwanese medical encounters between doctors and their elderly patients, this research observed the following. While the topic of birth and the birth information about the patient's family member is explicitly introduced or elicited via doctor's questions formulated with the birth core lexicon in Southern Min “senn/give birth to” (e.g., “how many children did you give birth to?”), discourse on death is not. Rather than being explicitly asked for, most information about patients’ deceased family members gets presented as responses to doctor's questions formulated with “a syntactical subject only” (e.g., “…and your husband?”) or conveying a positive assumption of a family member still being alive (e.g., “how old are your parents?”). These findings lead to my main argument that the face-threatening effects associated with death are balanced by posing an ambiguous question which opens a wide possibility for patients to volunteer death-related information which they perceive as relevant to the ongoing discourse, or by assuming the survival status of a family member and leaving the situation open for patients to confirm or correct this.

AB  - This paper deals with the referential value of third person pronouns used by French-speaking children (aged 1;10 to 3) in a corpus of natural dialogues, in different communicative situations (dyadic and polyadic; at home and in nursery school). The referential value of pronouns is assessed on a discursive and dialogical basis by studying the givenness and newness of referents in the children's utterances and the links with the interlocutor's discourse. The results show that, from the onset, pronouns mostly refer to objects that are already in the interlocutors’ focus of attention and that have been previously mentioned in the dialogue. Moreover, pronouns most often refer to a discourse object previously mentioned by the child's interlocutor. This suggests that the anaphoric value of pronouns is first acquired through dialogue before it is extended to monological uses.

AB  - After an overview of previous approaches to the relation between grammar and pragmatics we define grammar and pragmatics as two separate but not independent components of the theory of language modeling grammatical and pragmatic competences, respectively. In addition to assuming their co-operation in contexts of language use, we also accept that detached from their contexts, some pieces of contextual information can become context-independent. Furthermore, such kind of encyclopedic information and information concerning the use of language can be considered an integral part of lexical-semantic representations as well. The analysis of three types of Hungarian utterances, namely utterances containing implicit arguments, implicit predicates and co-composition, in the framework we propose demonstrates that grammatical factors (including lexical-semantic representations and morphosyntactic properties) and pragmatic factors (general and context-dependent pragmatic knowledge) thoroughly and intensively interact in various ways. On the basis of the analysis it can also be concluded that, in the absence of pragmatic information, use or interpretation predicted by grammar can often be evaluated as only typical or even underspecified, and, if the context is more specific, it can determine the utterance meaning to a greater degree.

AB  - This paper compares semantic indirectness and interactional indirectness in Tongan lexical honorification and relates them to each other, demonstrating a need for greater methodological and theoretical attention to interactional indirectness, both in the study of honorific systems and more generally in the linguistic conceptualization of indirectness. Semantically the Tongan honorific vocabulary is created primarily through metaphorical extensions and semantic bleaching of everyday words. These processes are common in linguistic honorific systems. While the metaphorical extensions predominate in Tongan language ideology, the semantically bleached words predominate in the actual use of the honorific vocabulary. There are conventions of entextualization of the Tongan honorific speech register that give it common linguistic features across a range of Tongan public social activities, and a common approach to the social personae who are the targets of honorification. These conventions render the semantically bleached words more semantically specific in use. In addition, in the lived reality of ongoing interaction, speakers collaborate in producing shared denotationally specific meanings of honorifics, while maintaining the surface vagueness of the semantically bleached honorific terms.

The present data analysis, drawn from naturally-occurring exchanges with 60 direction-givers in a gas station, expands current research by confirming and refining the conventionalized nature of the direction-giving exchange and its related phases as well as further exploring the potential existence of sex-related differences in direction-givers’ route-descriptions. Reconfirming Grice's (1975) well-known Cooperative Principle, an analysis of these data strongly suggest that an indirect request for driving directions is an effective communicative strategy for speakers approaching potential direction-givers. Furthermore, this analysis emphasizes the interrelatedness of the cognitive, linguistic and interactional tasks involved in direction-giving. A large body of important research has documented significant differences between the communicative styles of men and women. However, in this study, male and female participants’ use of directional indicators and their inclusion of landmarks, stoplight and time estimates, road names and highway numbers were very similar. Males included significantly more mileage estimates than did females, but their estimates contained more errors. These findings both confirm and contradict those of previous studies and have implications for future research, language teaching as well as the development of pedagogical materials.

In particular, it analyzes the verbal and non-verbal strategies that teachers deploy in encouraging children to engage in politeness routines, and examines ways that children initiate and respond to these routines with peers and socialize peers into them. This account is based on a 1-year ethnographic and linguistic study, which draws upon 48h of audio–visual recordings of 2–5-year-old native and non-native Japanese speaking children in the classroom and on the playground. The findings suggest that politeness routines as embodied social action are an important means through which children learn to use language to display kindness, empathy, and other-oriented behaviors toward others, which are central goals of preschool education in Japan. These findings will be discussed in relation to the socio-cultural organization of the strategies used in this socialization.

AB  - This paper aims to show that metaphors are a powerful tool to frame economic issues and serve certain political interests. To this purpose, we have carried out a comparative study of the conceptual metaphors of the Global Systemic Crisis in both English and Spanish. The financial crisis has indeed caused havoc in the economic panorama worldwide. Spain has been no exception, but, unlike other European countries, financial problems were initially belittled by the Spanish mass media for several months, until the subsequent outbreak of the crisis in relatively recent times. Following the current trend of corpus approaches to metaphor analysis (Charteris-Black, 2004, Deignan, 2006, Stefanowitsch and Gries, 2006), our study is based on a corpus of English and Spanish financial articles selected from those published during 2007 and the end of 2008 in the English journal The Economist and the Spanish newspaper El Economista. The analysis of the metaphors used in these articles will allow us to show how the same economic reality may be differently conceptualized at different points in time on account of different socio-political factors, such as a Government which, on the verge of national elections, refused to reveal the grim state of affairs of the national economy.

AB  - This study explores the interactional achievement of expert–novice in NS–NNS interaction. The analysis identifies interactional processes that contribute to expert–novice differentiation during team meetings that take place as part of an electrical and computer engineering course. Through analysis of data from the team interaction, participant perspectives, and ethnographic context, it is demonstrated that the NS takes on an expert identity, while the NNS takes on a novice identity as the NS and NNS engage in face-to-face interaction with each other. This expert–novice differentiation specifically occurs through the process of ratification, failure to ratify, and rejection of contributions. The NS's ability to gain expert status is linked to prior access to opportunities to participate in engineering teams and the forms of talk involved therein, which the NNS did not have access to. Conclusions indicate that this expert–novice relationship is not inherent to the NS–NNS relationship but that novice linguistically based identity has a bearing on the achievement of an expert non-linguistically based identity.

AB  - By incorporating the analytic power of language socialization and intercultural communication, this study looked into the influential factors involved in a Chinese MBA student's intercultural language socialization in an American negotiation class. The framework of intercultural language socialization functioned to organize cross-disciplinary concepts and analytical tools to unveil some of the subtle but interweaving links among different temporal phases and domains of the cross-cultural newcomer's developmental process, mainly from the perspectives of cross-cultural transfer, the interactive routine in the local communicative context, the influence of one's home cultural language socialization, and the individual's gradual incorporation of the locally practiced communicative norms.

AB  - Communication commonly occurs with both linguistic and gestural signals. In spoken languages the gestural signal can be manual (e.g., meaningful hand gestures) or vocal (e.g., meaningful uses of pauses, volume, and intonation), but in signed languages non-linguistic gesture and language occupy the same visual–gestural channel. One type of gesture, constructed action, is characteristically mimetic and allows for depiction of a character's actions with the speaker's body. We examine that type of gesture as it complements narratives presented in American Sign Language (ASL) to various audiences. A single text (an account of a Deaf leader's life) was recounted by two native Deaf signers of ASL to three different audiences, a design that allows us to apply the sociolinguistic framework of style known as audience design (Bell, 1984). The data show that constructed action can occur in both non-formal and formal settings. Additionally, if constructed action is analyzed by body parts (i.e., head, torso, arms/hands, and legs/feet) and degree of production (i.e., slight, moderate, exaggerated), some trends appear across settings. We suggest these trends could be attributed to the signers accommodating to their audiences. Finally, we report an association between degree of emphasis of constructed action and audience/setting for the two signers.

AB  - The use of communication strategies (CS) varies among second language (L2) learners. According to research, L2 learners resort to CS in times of difficulty. These strategies are also consciously or unconsciously utilized during language learning. One common CS strategy is the use of repetition, which entails the repetition of syntactic and/or lexical items by L2 learners. In order to observe prevalence, type and systematicity of repetition, two movies were shown to non-native speakers of English (NNSE) and non-native speakers of French (NNSF). Oral comments about the movies were elicited from the participants and then analyzed with a specific focus on repeated elements. The results of this study indicate that repetitions of grammatical and/or lexical elements were made irrespective of types or word class, phrase or sentence level. Most repeated elements among NNSE were observed to be verbs, pronouns and prepositions, and among NNSF, pronouns, determiners and verbs. Repetitions were made (1) as vocalized fillers, and (2) as self-repairs. These findings have significant implications for the teaching of English and French with specific reference to L2 learners’ oral communicative competence.

AB  - In Lexicology and Terminology, the notion of context often refers to a textual excerpt selected according to syntactic criteria, leaving aside any semantic and pragmatic analysis. For the creation of terminological knowledge bases (TKBs), this notion is too simplistic. Contexts must be studied from an integrated approach, such as Frame Semantics and Frame-Based Terminology. These theoretical and methodological frameworks do not separate the semantic and pragmatic components of language. Meaning is acquired in context, more specifically, within a frame including a semantic and pragmatic background. Within the domain of the environment, we select and manipulate multimodal information to offer two kinds of contexts to the end-user: (1) FrameNet-like contexts, more specifically, sentences showing the different syntactic constructions of the frame elements and the target predicate; (2) combined contexts, including knowledge-rich linguistic contexts coupled with knowledge-rich visual contexts, which provide a comprehensive view of related processes and specialized lexical units. In the TKB EcoLexicon, the resulting multimodal contexts are structured in terms of specific frames and general events. Thus, the end-users have the possibility to find both cognitive and communicative information, which is selected according to the user's level of expertise.

AB  - The present paper investigates how journalists create dialogical networks involving parliamentary discourse and newspaper articles via the reproduction of extracts coming from MPs’ speeches. Drawing on critical discourse analysis and assuming that news is a value-laden construction of facts through language, a comparative analysis of parliamentary proceedings and related newspaper articles is conducted. The articles collected cover a specific parliamentary debate on a particularly ‘hot’ issue in Greek society, namely a new bill introducing the interview as part of the procedure for the selection and recruitment of civil servants. The analysis shows that the facts reported seem to be selected not on the basis of their political or legal significance, but on the basis of their unusual consequences on parliamentary procedures. Special emphasis is given to the reconstruction of direct speech in newspaper narratives and to the use of metaphor as a conversational resource employed by MPs and reproduced by journalists in an attempt to attract their readers’ interest and arouse their emotions. Rather than informing the public on the actual parliamentary work, journalists mostly aim at creating and/or maintaining solidarity between readers and newspapers of the same political and ideological orientation.

It further investigates whether the phrase appears to be used as an epistemic device or an affective device, and the variety of pragmatic or semantic functions it fulfils in the discourse. With regard to both the full and the truncated phrase, British speakers use the phrase with different frequency and for different reasons than New Zealand speakers. Both phrases are used most often as a hedge or marker of uncertainty, and used predominantly in conversations, followed by meetings and oral history interviews. In addition, the phrase often occurs alone and mostly in the initial sentence position. And while native speakers used the phrases more as politeness devices, learners used them most to express hesitation or uncertainty. Further research could add to these findings by looking at all the meanings the phrases have in conversation, their use in academic discourse, as well as use of the single variant, ‘Dunno’. Learners would benefit by having some of this included in language learning materials.

AB  - A central topic in the study of pragmatics is how language contributes to the socialization of culturally shared values, skills, and practices. This paper employs a language socialization approach in order to investigate how the modal verb want is being used in two middle school dance classes as a tool for socializing students into becoming what their teacher describes as “better people” as well as “better dancers.” Data collection and analysis includes ethnographic observation and the video recording, transcription, and linguistic and pragmatic analysis of how participants use want within the context of pivotal sequences of classroom interaction. The findings of this paper support the theory, which has been developed in several fields but including especially cognitive psychology, that the use of mental state language in general, and the verb want in particular, plays an important role in making transparent the kinds of thought processes central to a number of socially valued competencies, including imitative, instructional and collaborative learning and the exercise of social, and thus also moral responsibility.

AB  - This paper explores the construction of collective identity by students in an academic learning environment, and shows how such collective identity may hinder or slow down individual learning or what may be referred to as independent learning. To demonstrate this I draw on language as a tool used for the construction of identity, and for showcasing and defending identity. The goal of this paper is to draw the attention of students and educators to the role of non-linguistic variables such as identity in student learning, and particularly in learning in a second language.11South Africa today is mounting a series of academic intervention programmes to bridge the skills shortage in the country. If these schemes are to succeed, thorough investigation and understanding of society, and in particular of the target group, will be required. The data presented in this article is extracted from my PhD study, and was collected through one group's focus group discussions, out of many used in the study. The participants were students of the then University of Natal, now the University of KwaZulu-Natal. The participants in this focus group were Zulu-speaking male students, and the data show that they strongly prefer a collective, rather than an individual identity, and this is indicated in their choice and style of language, and specifically in their choice of pronouns.

AB  - Laughter is employed in social interaction to construct meaning, identities, and relationships. Although studies have begun to examine humour within the medical workplace, none have employed observational methods to study laughables/laughter within the learning triad of the bedside teaching encounter (BTE). This paper focuses on this gap by exploring the novel question: How do students, patients, and doctors construct and co-construct power, identity and gender through laughter within BTEs? In this paper, we focus on the disaffiliative function of laughables/laughter across BTEs. Most of the laughables presented can be construed as teases: fallibility, frustration, cynicism and/or sexual teasing; and this teasing was accompanied by a competitive rather than collaborative play frame. Teasing and laughter was employed by participants to maintain or subvert existing power asymmetries, to construct identities, for example, as individuals who are intelligent, witty and powerful, and to construct gender by performing masculinity or femininity. Further research with a larger and more diverse sample of participants (including more female doctors, male students and female patients) is now essential to explore more fully the co-construction of power, identities and gender through laughter within medical workplace learning encounters.

AB  - This paper examines teasing – an interactionally delicate social action, which appears to be both face threatening and face enhancing – situated in Japanese institutional multi-party discourse. Adopting conversation analytic and ethnographic approaches to discourse, this paper first reconsiders the notion of face and facework as discursively constructed phenomena. The paper then documents how the face of tease recipients is displayed and contested in discourse: the linguistic behavior of the teased immediately before the onset of a teasing sequence exhibits certain deviations, which trigger the subsequent tease. The paper takes a closer look at the emerging face of the teased from the perspective of their community of practice. It demonstrates how the tease recipients’ modes of participation are related to face threats occurring in teasing segments and how their active role in the joint act of teasing may impact the construction of their evolving identities within their community of practice. The findings suggest that teasing sequences represent instances in which a tacit norm of appropriateness becomes observable in discourse, that facework can be depicted as an argumentative process in which one's face ascription is contested and altered, and that the face threats involved in specific teasing segments are related to the tease recipients’ mode of participation in their community of practice.

AB  - This paper describes how the leaders of a group of English language teachers in a Hong Kong public education institute constructed various personal identities for themselves through the discourse of the request e-mails they sent to their subordinates. The request e-mails were analyzed at both clause and discourse levels to reveal the strategies the leaders employed for constructing desirable personal identities and ultimately achieving request compliance. At the clause level, first, the lexico-grammar was analyzed by drawing upon systemic functional grammar; and second the leaders’ management of the relationship with their subordinates was analyzed with reference to the constructs of rapport management and relational work. At the discourse level, the way the authors supported their request was analyzed by drawing upon the influence tactics framework. It is argued in the paper that the e-mail authors’ legitimate or position power intrinsically associated with their capacity as leaders was not sufficient in obtaining request compliance – additional elements like desirable personal identities were necessary in getting their subordinates to comply with the requests made via e-mails. The identities constructed included those of (1) an accountable leader, (2) a rational leader, (3) an authoritative leader, (4) an understanding, considerate and polite leader, and (5) a capable leader.

The article focuses on investigating the relations between choices of certain linguistic forms and the ideologies and power relations which underlie such forms. Guided by assumptions of critical discourse analysis and drawing on the analytical framework offered in Michael Halliday's Systemic Functional Grammar, the article examines two dimensions of clause grammar: transitivity and lexical cohesion, which may be respectively associated with the ideational and textual functions of language. By analyzing aspects of clause grammar related to these two dimensions of language in news texts of different ideological orientations, the article shows that interpretations of the NATO bombing and of the roles of social actors involved in the bombing event are constructed in the specific choices that each newspaper makes in the two dimensions of text organization.

AB  - Nominalizations tend to be associated with academic writing as they can assist in maintaining an impersonal tone, often by deleting a human agent within a given sentence. There are additional functions, such as helping to create textual cohesion, all of which have relevance in the production of quality academic texts. Based on the previous work regarding the use of nominalizations within academic writing (Biber, 1988, Biber et al., 1998, Guillen Galve, 1998, Charles, 2003), a question arises which this paper seeks to address. If we assume that nominalizations, to an extent, are a feature of accomplished academic writing, what are the implications for their use within each year of an undergraduate degree program—how do students develop their use of nominalizations? For purposes of addressing this question, the academic writing of six undergraduate students was analyzed throughout each year of their degree course. The six participants studied on an academic program entitled ‘Language, Literacy and Communication’ (LLC), part of the School of Education at The University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, with the results demonstrating that nominalizations do not necessarily play a prominent role within the academic writing of this community.

AB  - Early research on Japanese honorific and plain forms (i.e., non-honorific forms) claims that the use of honorific forms is socio-pragmatically governed, so that the speaker of lower status is obligated to employ these forms when interacting with an addressee of higher status. On the other hand, more recent studies on this topic empirically demonstrate that lower-status speakers employ a mixed use of honorific and plain forms even in inter-status interactions. Building on this recent work, this study examines subordinates’ use of plain forms in superior–subordinate interactions in a Japanese workplace, focusing on indexical meanings of these forms. The data in this study demonstrate that subordinates adopt plain forms in diverse situated contexts, such as self-addressing utterances, providing opinions, and clarifying superiors’ directives. Confirming that individuals adopt plain forms in a strategic manner even in a context where a hierarchical differential clearly exists, this study concludes that in superior–subordinate interactions in workplace discourse, subordinates’ use of the plain form indexes (1) the speaker's inward thought, and (2) the speaker's highlighting of information. The findings of this study further support the more recent research on indexical meanings of the plain form in Japanese.

AB  - Sensitivity to eye gaze is suggested to be an important prerequisite for intersubjectivity and for normal language development. The present study investigated visual check back in two age groups of typically developed children and one group of children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI, n=10). The control children were matched to the SLI children with regard to language level (LMC, n=10) and to age (AMC, n=10). Play setting situations, including child and teacher, were designed to elicit the children's use of visual check back. The children with lower language level (SLI children aged 5:0 and LMC children aged 2:1) gave visual check back significantly more seldom than the higher language level children (aged 5:1) and they also needed more time for giving check back, i.e. there is a relation between visual check back and language level. The results indicate that children with SLI have a deviant visual communication that further worsens their already limited communicative ability.

AB  - Rhetoric is classically divided into three notions: ethos, pathos, and logos. Taking a discursive approach to the construction of identity as a turn-by-turn members’ achievement, we hope to add fresh insights to the rhetorical notion of ethos. More specifically, using a transcript of one of President Kennedy's meetings about the space race, we examine how Kennedy and his advisors ‘do’ identity to strategic effect. Findings indicate how Kennedy initiates the topic of geo-politics which (1) makes relevant his identity as president and evokes a domain of practice in which his voice counts and (2) evokes the ‘them and us’ polarity of the Soviet threat which allows Kennedy to speak as ‘us’, and thus with the authority of the American people. Conversely, his main advisor orients to Kennedy's identity as president, but he subverts the predicates linked with this identity to his own ends. He refers to another predicate of president, namely political vulnerability and argues that Kennedy should therefore not stake everything on getting a man on the moon before the Soviets. To increase his ‘good sense’ and counter Kennedy's deployment of political responsibilities linked to the identity of president, his advisor evokes an expert identity based on superior access to scientific knowledge.

KW  - Interactional competencies
AB  - This study aims to discuss role-play activity in oral proficiency interviews (OPIs) in terms of its construct validity; that is, whether it correlates with what it is supposed to measure. The data for the analysis were obtained from 71 role-play activities conducted during an OPI. The analysis is based on conversation analytic (CA) methodology and invokes the analytic frameworks of interactive footing and interactional competencies. Conversational analyses performed on the data revealed that candidates executed not only the role-play instructions but also the interviewers’ explicit and implicit requirements of the next desirable action. In doing so, candidates employed and displayed their interactional competencies in role-play interactions. The role-play activity in the OPI being managed by the interviewer created an asymmetrical relationship between the interviewers and the candidates in terms of speaking rights (i.e., turn-taking and topical organization). Nevertheless, competencies that candidates displayed in performing a role-play activity did not seem different from those employed in ordinary conversations. Thus, role-play activity in OPIs, if recognized as an interactional phenomenon co-constructed by participants’ display of their turn-by-turn practical evaluation of each other's actions, seems to be a valid instrument for assessing the candidates’ performance of the given tasks.

KW  - Arabic
AB  - Using Standard Arabic original texts and idiomatic English translations, this paper considers syntactic, discoursal and denotative similarities and differences between English and Arabic in respect of junction. In order to define the basic analytical scope, a composite definition of ‘sentence’ is developed, integrating grammatical, semantic and punctuational/intonational criteria. It is argued for both English and Arabic that the adjunction–disjunction distinction is properly syntactic, but that disjunction–coordination is perhaps better understood as a semantic cline. The relationship between thematic structure, mainness–subordination and grounding is investigated. While English typically backgrounds rhematic subordinate clauses, with disjuncts more likely to be foregrounded than adjuncts, Arabic readily allows foregrounding of rhematic subordinate clauses. The Arabic disjuncts (‘id) and (h˙ayt_) ‘since, as’ may display discoursal independence beyond that possible for a foregrounded subordinate disjunct rheme in English. While English standardly requires both main coordinate clauses to be foregrounded, Arabic allows either clause to be foregrounded or backgrounded. Denotative differences are illustrated by the greater capacity of Arabic adjunct-heads (h˙attaa) and (ila ‘an) ‘until’ for denotative independence from their main clause than English ‘until’. Discoursal and denotative factors may interact to produce Arabic coordinate-clause types which are strikingly unlike English ones.
