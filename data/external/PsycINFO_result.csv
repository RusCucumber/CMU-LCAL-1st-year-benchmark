APA PsycInfo,psyh,2009-99150-027,Learning to request in Japanese through foreign language classroom instruction.,"This study examines the effects of instructional practices on Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) learners' pragmatic competence in learning how to request in Japanese. It also investigates how instructional effects are displayed depending on the type of outcome measure (Jeon & Kaya, 2006). A preliminary study, conducted prior to the main study in order to investigate strengths and weaknesses of JFL learners of different proficiency levels when requesting in Japanese, showed that the learners had difficulties with opening and closing moves, request strategies, and the sociopragmatic aspects of requesting. These findings were incorporated into the instructional materials for the main study. The participants in the main study were JFL learners enrolled in fourth-semester university-level Japanese courses. Two classes (Regular group, <i>N=22</i> ) received regular explicit instruction on requests following a course syllabus, while two others (Expanded group, <i>N=24</i>) received additional pragmatics instruction. The effect of instruction was measured through four outcome measures that involved request-making situations: discourse completion task (DCT), telephone message task, role play task and video clip rating task. The data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. A significant instructional effect was revealed in the telephone and role play tasks. Moreover, the learners performed significantly better in the role play than in the telephone task, which was attributed to the presence of the interlocutor who offered repairs to ratify the learners' requestive intent or candidate understanding. This finding suggests that interactive versus non-interactive tasks might differentially affect the learning outcome. A relatively large instructional effect was found in the video task which examined the learners' metapragmatic awareness. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the number of conventionally indirect strategies in the post-test DCT, telephone and role play tasks that examined learners' use of request strategies. This suggests that instructional effects manifest in a similar manner regardless of the type of outcome measure. Overall, there was no significant difference between the groups. While learner requests became sequentially better organized in the post-test, both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic problems remained. The study contributes to the research literature on the effect of instruction on the classroom learning of L2 pragmatics.

APA PsycInfo,psyh,2010-03315-003,Style shifts among Japanese learners before and after study abroad in Japan: Becoming active social agents in Japanese.,"Previous studies on L2 Japanese sojourners often reported that learners overuse the plain style or haphazardly mix the plain and polite styles upon return. These styles, which are often associated with formal or informal contexts, also index complex social and situational meanings, and native speakers are reported to shift their styles to create desired contexts. In order to better understand L2 development of the use of the plain and polite styles during study abroad, the current study examined the use of the polite/plain styles and style shifts among five English-speaking male students who studied in Japan for one academic year by comparing their performances both quantitatively and qualitatively in oral proficiency interviews before and after they studied abroad. Upon return, three predominantly used the polite style talking to the interviewer (their former teacher), while two primarily used the plain style. Though the quantitative analysis may lead one to conclude that these two students regressed in their pragmatic competence, the qualitative analysis revealed that all five learners gained some understanding of social meanings of the plain and polite styles and became more active social agents who make decisions to shift the styles.
