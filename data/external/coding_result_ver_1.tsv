1	1	Gyogi	2016	Journal	Pretest-Posttest Design	This study examined whether an indexical approach instruction can gain the awareness of honorific/plain style shifts in English to Japanese text translation tasks.

Major reasons for style selection in the pretest: (1) textbook/teacher ideology; (2) mixed-style is grammatically incorrect; (3) based on a static factor (e.g., closness btw a writer and a reader); (4) mixed-style due to confusion  Major reasons for style selection in the posttest: (1) adding "!" or "-ne" to desu/masu styles to index friendship; (2) the use of plain form to index the lack of writer's knowledge to show politeness in English; (3) mixed style to index different intention (desu/masu for sincerity, gratitude, request; plain for friendship)																						
2	2	Yoshimi	2001	Book Chapter	Quasi-Experimental Design	This study examined the imapcts of explicit pragmatic instruction with communicative practice and feedback on Japanese discourse markers (n desu, n desu kedo, n desu ne).	Interactional Discourse Marker		n desu, n desu kedo, n desu ne	US	University	Classroom	Noticing Hypothesis	TRUE	TRUE	Frequency		FALSE	Oral Storytelling Task				Oral Storytelling Task	17			Experimental	Chinese, English		3rd Year				TRUE	5			Long Treatments	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	Oral Interaction between L1s	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	Oral Story Telling Task with an L1	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	Positive	Frequency of interactional discourse markers (clauses w/ markers per clauses) increased from .02 in the pretest to .39 in the posttest.  More than 50% accuracy of the overall interactional discourse markers use in terms of L1 speakers' acceptability judgement.  Regarding n desu, during instructional periods, learners suffered from the overgeneralization/underdeveloped awareness of a n desu function due to its underuse during practices. Since n desu was used with the more than 50% accuracy in the posttest, instruction might push learners to use n desu.	Saliency of Function in Tasks, Restriction Level of Items	The use of n desu kedo & n desu ne is relatively more restricted than n desu, possibly leading to the underuse of these two forms in the posttest.  Regarding n desu kedo, learners tended to use it to mark background information, the function of which was not instructed thourgh sessions. Since learners might have more trouble in introduction, they paid more attention to n desu kedo, resulting in the relatively higher accuracy in the posttest (75%).  Similarly as n desu kedo, the learner's underuse of n desu ne was salient in the function of noninitial position, this saliency led learners to use n desu ne accurately in this function.	Positive	The increase of interactional discourse markers was only observed in the experimental group.

3	3	Utashiro & Kawai	2009	Book Chapter	Pretest-Posttest Design	This study investigated the facilitative role of a CALL approach on Japanese reactive tokens (i.e., backchannels).

The positive changes of mean scores in criteria 1-7 suggest the benefits of overall sessions.  The sig. diff. btw pretest & posttest 1 & positive changes of mean scores in criteria 1 suggests the benefits of CALL sessions  Delayed posttest scores in criteria 8 outperformed pretest scores may suggest the benefits of instruction. (Mean scores of 8 were relatively higher from pretest → ceiling effects...?) Meanwhile, other criteria scores in delayed practice did not show any sig. diff. from posttest 2, indicating 1w retension.	Instruction Type, Evaluation Criteria	Only scores of criteria 1 improved after the CALL session. Explicit information & fill-in-the-blank are not sufficient to improve other criteria...?					Positive	ANOVA and post-hoc multiple comparison showed significant posttests scores (regardless of timing, including delayed posttest) outperformed pretest scores, suggested the benefits of overall instructional sessions.  Furthermore, there was no significant difference between posttest 2 & delayed posttest, suggesting one-week retension in recognition task.	Instruction Type	Socres in posttest 2 (i.e., after instructor-/peer-based sessions) outperformed those in posttest 1 (i.e., after CALL sessions), suggesting the additional benefits of instructor-/peer-based sessions (i.e., more fill-in-the-blank tasks, role-plays).																				
4	4	Kakegawa	2009	Book Chapter	Pretest-Posttest Design	This study examined the impacts of explicit instruction and email correspondence with L1 speakers (cf., ACMC) on Japanese sentence final particles, ne, yo, no, and yone.	Interactional Sentence Final Particle		ne, yo, no, yone	US	University	Classroom	Explicit Instruction, CMC/ACMC	TRUE	TRUE	Frequency		FALSE	Email Correspondence				Email Correspondence	11	8	3	NA	English, Chinese	Intermediate	2nd Year		18	22	TRUE	11	8	3	Medium Treatments	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	Emails	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	Email Correspondence	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	Positive	Regarding frequency, N SFPs used by learners increased from pretest to posttest (ne: x2; yo: x3; no: x2; yone: 0→0.05). Meanwhile, learners underused ne/no and overused yo compared with L1 writers.  Regarding accuracy based on L1 acceptability judgements, accuracy generally increased over instructional sessions (ne: 56.9%→57.1%→73.6%; yo: 96.1%→88.3%→97%; no: 72.7%→48.4%→76.9%; yone: na→16.7%→3.3%).  Qualitative analyses revealed that learners used -ne in formulaic expressions (e.g., mata-ne = see you) but started using -ne in non-formulaic expressions.	Instruction Type, Restriction Level of Items, Overgeneralization of Functions, Misunderstanding of Functions, Linguistic Difficulty, L1 peers' ID	Overuse of yo might be due to that yo is less restricted than ne when both options can be applicable.  Additional instruction (i.e., feedback & discussion) might draw learners' attention to their erroneous SFP use, suggesting different treatments have different impacts.  Some L1 peers have never used SFPs except ne, potentially affecting learners' production.  Errors in (1) ne due to misunderstanding of "shared information"; (2) yo due to morphological difficulty (ii n da yo vs. ii da yo); (3) yo due to overgeneralization of "emphasetic marker"; (4) yone due to overgeneralization of "comments with complete agreement".

Linguistic Difficulty, Fluency, Task Planning, Context Familiarity of Item	One student struggled with vocabulary and structure when they produced speech. In addition, they suffered from fluency problem though they knew pragmalinguistic/sociopragmatic knowledge.  One student did not carefully plan for role-plays, resulting in lower scores. In addition, planning in L1 required students higher cognitive load to translate them into Japanese.  Some students received higher scores when item context is familiar with them.	Negative	ANOVA showed significant interaction effects between time and group. In addition, descriptive statistics showed that only implicit group increased role-play scores from pretest to posttest. Thus, this results suggest that implicit group might benefit more from treatments.	Proficiency Level, Interaction with L1s outside of class	Implicit group received significantly higher final exam scores than explicit group.  Implicit group had more opportunities to interact with L1 Japanese speakers.

However, journal writing was offerred only after instructional sessions, and it cannot be said whether those awareness emerged by treatments or those awareness existed before treatments. 							Positive	Generally, posttest DCT socres increased from pretest ones (Cohen & Ishihara, 2005, p. 13). Meanwhile, scores of complainmenting were likely to remain before and after treatments.	Proficiency Level, Pragmatic Target, Raters' ID	The materials were found to have at least some impact, especially for those students  who demonstrated more limited ability in speech act performance at the outset. (Cohen and Ishihara, 2005, p. 2). those who had the highest rated gain scores   were those who had somewhat lower scores (in the mid-teens) in the pre-measure,  whereas those who were seen to improve the least tended to be the higher achievers at  the start. (Cohen and Ishihara, 2005, p. 13)  Averaged pre- and post-measure ratings of speech act performance tended to vary  according to speech act, with the Request unit appearing to be the most effective (Cohen and Ishihara, 2005, p. 2) → maybe because learners have already learned request before sessions. → Moreover, most studies have examined request more than other speech acts, and the authors could provide relatively more effective materials.  the raters should only have paid attention to goodness of fit in the discourse, and not to the pragmatic appropriateness of what they wrote. However, as can be gleaned from the detailed examination of the major discrepancies in scores (see the extended note for Table 12 below), raters at times were addressing different factors in their ratings, despite our best efforts to train them to base their ratings on the same criteria. Consequently, the ratings were not as  valid as they might have been. Learners were penalized, for example, for linguistic  mistakes, for leaving a rejoinder slot blank, and for giving a response lacking in appropriateness, although these phenomena were not intended to be reflected in this particular rating category. Moreover, raters did not always provide reasons for their scores. (Cohen and Ishihara, 2005, p. 29 - 30)

Comparing posttest 1 & HW3 DCT (i.e., learners could see SCOBAs), learners used more apology-based expressions in HW3, suggesting materialization level of dev. Meanwhile, the same freq. level of apology-based expression was used in HW4 & posttest 2, suggesting internalization (p. 124).  Elaboration strategies & emotion expressions increased from pre to posttests (p. 127). Some thanking strategies were used in HW but not in posttest 1, suggesting learners' materialization lvl. Meanwhile, in posttest 2, learners performed better, suggesting self-regulation lvl (p. 127). Qual. analysis also showed more various expressions in posttests than in pretests (p. 129). Moreover, some students modified expressions shown in SCOBAs, suggesting their creative use of forms (p. 130).							Positive	Some students used L2 metapragmatic knowledge when they select forms in DCTs (p. 135; p. 141).
