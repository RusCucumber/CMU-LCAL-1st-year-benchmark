Communication Source,cms,136410668,Learning how to learn pragmatics: Application of self-directed strategies to pragmatics learning in L2 Chinese and Japanese.,"Learning strategies are self-generated actions taken to make learning more efficient, productive, and transferable to new settings (Oxford, 1990, 2011). We can teach students how to use learning strategies efficiently, helping them gain autonomy and control of their own learning process. This study applied strategy instruction to pragmatics learning in a second language (L2). Adapting Oxford's (2011) taxonomy, we taught L2 learners various cognitive and metacognitive strategies, including how to pay attention to select pragmatic features, and how to monitor and evaluate their learning of the features. Four L2 Chinese learners and six L2 Japanese learners in a US university received strategy instruction on targeted pragmatic features (i.e., conversation opening/closing; indirect meaning). The instruction was followed by a two-week period in which students kept a daily journal recording their experiences with the targeted features. Interviews were conducted at the end to gauge students' reflections of the strategy applications. Results showed that students noticed targeted pragmatic features in available resources, but there was imbalance in the degree of noticing and types of strategies used.",20190101,"Naoko Taguchi ; Xiaofei Tang ; Maa, Joy",Article,Academic Journal,2019,true,East Asian Pragmatics,Foreign language education ; Pragmatics ; Second language acquisition ; Linguistics ; Chinese language ; Japanese language ; Self-managed learning (Personnel management),JOUR,,,2055-7752,,,,,eng,University of Toronto Press,36,11,26,4,1,10.1558/eap.38207,,JVRU,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=3e6d91bf-bd22-321a-b165-3521e924f2c5
Communication Source,cms,161732317,Learning Japanese interactional particles through a usage-based and concept-based language instruction.,"The purpose of the current study is two-fold. First, this paper aims to uncover the three-year acquisition process of three interactional particles, ne, yo, and yone by three Chinese-speaking learners of Japanese in a corpus. Among the three particles, yone appeared the latest after one year of study abroad, and the learners progressed in their usage by trying to share epistemic stance and assessments by using yone. However, understanding the epistemic stance for the speaker's world is challenging. Second, this paper supports the integration of usage-based approaches and sociocultural theory. For teaching interactional particles effectively in the classroom, understanding of the role of intersubjectivity in discourse is crucial. This paper proposes three sets of schematic visual representations for core meanings of ne, yo, and yone, which is essential for concept-based language instruction.",20230101,Kyoko Masuda,Article,Academic Journal,2023,true,East Asian Pragmatics,Japanese language ; Language & languages ; Learning ; Foreign study ; Sociocultural theory ; Intersubjectivity,JOUR,,,2055-7752,,,,,eng,University of Toronto Press,56,27,30,8,1,10.1558/eap.22036,,JVRU,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=39b7bf52-1b9b-3794-8c6d-3ebb1990cbb9
