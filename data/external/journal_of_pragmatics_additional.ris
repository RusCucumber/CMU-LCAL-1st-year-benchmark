AB  - Studies of L1 communicative competence within the framework of language socialization have recognized the rich interplay of linguistic knowledge and sociocultural knowledge in the process of language socialization. Following this research tradition, some studies of L2 acquisition have begun to conceptualize this process as one of secondary socialization. This study argues that the language socialization framework also provides rich opportunities for the detailed, qualitative study of learner production, and of the role of the learner's L1 socialization on this production. A study of English-speaking learners' anomalous uses of the Japanese particle ne in their L2 production of Japanese, which takes into account the distinct communicative styles of the target language (L2) and the learners' base language (L1), is undertaken. Using qualitative discourse analysis, the learners' use of ne in talk with native speaker conversation partners is shown to be influenced by L1 culturally-ordered epistemic constraints, as well as by L1 discourse practices pertaining to stances of sharedness. The contribution of the language socialization framework, applied in combination with qualitative, discourse analytic methods, to the study of L2 learner production is discussed in conjunction with the findings. The importance of considering the role of affective and epistemic dimensions of communication in the study of L2 learner production is highlighted.

AB  - While much attention has previously been paid to the well-known phenomenon of subject omission in Japanese, the flip side of the same phenomenon – namely, cases where the subjects are overtly expressed, in particular even in typical environments for the omission – has been neglected in the literature of Japanese linguistics. Focusing on first and second person subjects, the current study details the role of their overt use in conversations, and shows that in addition to the function in discourse contexts, such as ‘contrastiveness’ and ‘emphasis’, the overt expression of first and second person subjects is a useful tool to index the speaker's social relationship with the other participant, such as social difference or intimacy. This is particularly important for a group of pro-drop languages like Japanese and Korean, in which the expression of difference is the norm and a variety of personal references play a significant role in expressing such difference, as well as intimacy.

AB  - Interactional routines are powerful in first language acquisition contexts, socializing children into appropriate norms of language use. This paper investigates the role of interactional routines in the socialization of L2 interactional competence via analysis of 15 hours of foreign language classroom data. Results reveal that active and peripheral participation in the routines of the classroom shapes learner ability to use the follow-up turn of the IRF routine to perform assessments and other expressions responsive to their interlocutor's utterances. Instances in which teachers explicitly guide learners in the expression of alignment are rare. In teacher-fronted contexts, learners are guided to be responsive to teacher questions, and have little opportunity for expression of alignment, including assessments. Learner assessments, when they occur in teacher-fronted contexts, have particular sequential consequences, triggering extended assessment activity by the teacher. The teachers' language incorporates various follow-up turn expressions during interaction with students. Longitudinal analysis of learner language during pair-work reveals an increase in learner use of follow-up expressions, including assessments, evidencing the socializing power of both active and peripheral participation in the interactional routines of the classroom.

AB  - The present paper considers the perceived emotional weight of the phrase I love you in multilinguals’ different languages. The sample consists of 1459 adult multilinguals speaking a total of 77 different first languages. They filled out an on-line questionnaire with open and closed questions linked to language behavior and emotions. Feedback on the open question related to perceived emotional weight of the phrase I love you in the multilinguals’ different languages was recoded in three categories: it being strongest in (1) the first language (L1), (2) the first language and a foreign language, and (3) a foreign language (LX). A majority of speakers felt I love you was strongest in their L1. Participants offered various explanations for their perception. Statistical analyses revealed that the perception of weight of the phrase I love you was associated with self-perceived language dominance, context of acquisition of the L2, age of onset of learning the L2, degree of socialization in the L2, nature of the network of interlocutors in the L2, and self-perceived oral proficiency in the L2.

AB  - The Japanese language has developed, and is embedded in, a particular social and cultural system and the purpose here is to relate the two in a comprehensive yet succinct and accessible manner for those unfamiliar with either. Due to the difficulties of approaching the matter in this way, certain simplifications and overgeneralizations are inevitable, although I have tried to avoid them. The majority of research reviewed here has been especially selected because it has been conducted by non-Japanese researchers and therefore fuller explanations are usually available in English (or sometimes German). However, the work of Japanese investigators will also be mentioned when their work is in English or, if not, particularly relevant and significant. Western researchers frequently offer different insights and follow different approaches from native scholars (cf. section 1.2 below. Until only very recently the literature in English on Japanese sociolinguistics was very limited and there were few non-Japanese researchers. Today, it is encouraging to observe the contemporary increase in studies by non-Japanese, which reflects the growing internationalization of the field of Japanese sociolinguistics.

AB  - Language learning cannot be separated from the setting in which it is used, and language socialization research has shown that children acquire sociocultural knowledge of their native language (L1) through participation in language mediated activities in the home and community. How do young children with already established sociocultural competence in L1 acquire competency in second language (L2) interactional skills? This study examines how kindergartners are socialized to initiate and respond to L2 discourse sequences in a Japanese immersion classroom. Using video-taped naturalistic data of classroom interactions, children's performance of three daily routines is analyzed qualitatively, noting scaffolded help provided by the teacher, peers, and changes in content and participant structure over several months. Data reveal increasing autonomy in initiating and responding roles and spontaneous incorporation of a routine in a novel situation, demonstrating that routines provide a framework and mechanism for L2 competence beyond the level of creative L2 output, which basically remained at the word-level throughout the first year.
